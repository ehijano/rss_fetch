      <title>Towards a "universal translator" for neural dynamics at single-cell, single-spike resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.</description>

      <title>Modeling flexible behaviour by the interactions between hippocampus and cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals flexibly change their behaviour depending on context. In theory, such context-dependent behaviour can be explained by model-based reinforcement learning models. However, existing models lack structure underlying context-dependent model selection and thus, a correspondence to neural activity and brain regions. Here, we employ interacting sequential and context-inference modules to drive model-based learning as a means to better understand experimental neuronal activity data, lesion studies, and clinical research. We propose a neural circuit implementation of the sequential module by the hippocampus and the context-inference module by the cortex that together enable flexible behaviour. Our model explains a variety of experimental findings, including impairments in model-based reasoning reported in lesion studies. Furthermore, our model predicts the relationship between deficits in model-based learning and sensory processing, which often co-occur in psychoses such as schizophrenia (SZ) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</description>

      <title>An Information-Geometric Formulation of Pattern Separation and Evaluation of Existing Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern separation is a computational process by which dissimilar neural patterns are generated from similar input patterns. We present an information-geometric formulation of pattern separation, where a pattern separator is modelled as a family of statistical distributions on a manifold. Such a manifold maps an input (i.e. coordinates) to a probability distribution that generates firing patterns. Pattern separation occurs when small coordinate changes result in large distances between samples from the corresponding distributions. Under this formulation, we implement a two-neuron system whose probability law forms a 3-dimensional manifold with mutually orthogonal coordinates representing the neurons' marginal and correlational firing rates. We use this highly controlled system to examine the behaviour of spike train similarity indices commonly used in pattern separation research. We found that all indices (except scaling factor) were sensitive to relative differences in marginal firing rates, but no index adequately captured differences in spike trains that resulted from altering the correlation in activity between the two neurons. That is, existing pattern separation metrics appear (A) sensitive to patterns that are encoded by different neurons, but (B) insensitive to patterns that differ only in relative spike timing (e.g. synchrony between neurons in the ensemble).</description>

      <title>The Origin of Quantum Mechanical Statistics: Some Insights from the Research on Human Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identical systems, or entities, are indistinguishable in quantum mechanics (QM), and the symmetrization postulate rules the possible statistical distributions of a large number of identical quantum entities. However, a thorough analysis on the historical development of QM attributes the origin of quantum statistics, in particular, Bose-Einstein statistics, to a lack of statistical independence of the micro-states of identical quantum entities. We have recently identified Bose-Einstein statistics in the combination of words in large texts, as a consequence of the entanglement created by the meaning carried by words when they combine in human language. Relying on this investigation, we put forward the hypothesis that entanglement, hence the lack of statistical independence, is due to a mechanism of contextual updating, which provides deeper reasons for the appearance of Bose-Einstein statistics in human language. However, this investigation also contributes to a better understanding of the origin of quantum mechanical statistics in physics. Finally, we provide new insights into the intrinsically random behaviour of microscopic entities that is generally assumed within classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>CoCoG-2: Controllable generation of visual stimuli for understanding human concept representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans interpret complex visual stimuli using abstract concepts that facilitate decision-making tasks such as food selection and risk avoidance. Similarity judgment tasks are effective for exploring these concepts. However, methods for controllable image generation in concept space are underdeveloped. In this study, we present a novel framework called CoCoG-2, which integrates generated visual stimuli into similarity judgment tasks. CoCoG-2 utilizes a training-free guidance algorithm to enhance generation flexibility. CoCoG-2 framework is versatile for creating experimental stimuli based on human concepts, supporting various strategies for guiding visual stimuli generation, and demonstrating how these stimuli can validate various experimental hypotheses. CoCoG-2 will advance our understanding of the causal relationship between concept representations and behaviors by generating visual stimuli. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/CoCoG-2}.</description>

      <title>Deep multimodal saliency parcellation of cerebellar pathways: linking microstructure and individual function through explainable multitask learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parcellation of human cerebellar pathways is essential for advancing our understanding of the human brain. Existing diffusion MRI tractography parcellation methods have been successful in defining major cerebellar fibre tracts, while relying solely on fibre tract structure. However, each fibre tract may relay information related to multiple cognitive and motor functions of the cerebellum. Hence, it may be beneficial for parcellation to consider the potential importance of the fibre tracts for individual motor and cognitive functional performance measures. In this work, we propose a multimodal data-driven method for cerebellar pathway parcellation, which incorporates both measures of microstructure and connectivity, and measures of individual functional performance. Our method involves first training a multitask deep network to predict various cognitive and motor measures from a set of fibre tract structural features. The importance of each structural feature for predicting each functional measure is then computed, resulting in a set of structure-function saliency values that are clustered to parcellate cerebellar pathways. We refer to our method as Deep Multimodal Saliency Parcellation (DeepMSP), as it computes the saliency of structural measures for predicting cognitive and motor functional performance, with these saliencies being applied to the task of parcellation. Applying DeepMSP we found that it was feasible to identify multiple cerebellar pathway parcels with unique structure-function saliency patterns that were stable across training folds.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of ODE neuron models using gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroscientists fit morphologically and biophysically detailed neuron simulations to physiological data, often using evolutionary algorithms. However, such gradient-free approaches are computationally expensive, making convergence slow when neuron models have many parameters. Here we introduce a gradient-based algorithm using differentiable ODE solvers that scales well to high-dimensional problems. GPUs make parallel simulations fast and gradient calculations make optimization efficient. We verify the utility of our approach optimizing neuron models with active dendrites with heterogeneously distributed ion channel densities. We find that individually stimulating and recording all dendritic compartments makes such model parameters identifiable. Identification breaks down gracefully as fewer stimulation and recording sites are given. Differentiable neuron models, which should be added to popular neuron simulation packages, promise a new era of optimizable neuron models with many free parameters, a key feature of real neurons.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>
