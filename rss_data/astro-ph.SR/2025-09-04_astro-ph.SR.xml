      <title>A Galactic Perspective on the (Unremarkable) Relative Refractory Depletion Observed in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the Sun has been observed to be depleted in refractory elements as a function of elemental condensation temperature (\tcond) relative to $\sim 80\%$ of its counterparts. We assess the impact of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on refractory element--\tcond\ trends for 109,500 unique solar analogs from the GALAH, APOGEE, Gaia RVS, and \cite{bedell18} surveys. We find that a star's \feh\ and \alphafe\ are indicators of its \tcond\ slope (\rsq\ = $15 \pm 5$, $23 \pm 10\%$ respectively) while \teff\ and \logg\ contribute more weakly (\rsq\ = $9 \pm 5$, $13 \pm 16\%$). The Sun's abundance pattern resembles that of more metal-rich (0.1 dex) and $\alpha$-depleted stars ($-0.02$ dex), suggesting a connection to broader GCE trends. To more accurately model stars' nucleosynthetic signatures, we apply the K-process model from \cite{Griffith24}, which casts each star's abundance pattern as a linear combination of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae contributions. We find the Sun appears chemically ordinary in this framework, lying within $0.5\sigma$ of the expected solar analog abundance distribution. We show that refractory element--\tcond\ trends arise because elements with higher \tcond\ have higher contributions from core-collapse supernovae. Refractory element depletion trends primarily reflect nucleosynthetic enrichment patterns shaped by GCE and local ISM inhomogeneities, with these processes accounting for $93\%$ of the observed variation within 2$\sigma$. This work highlights how abundance diversity due to local and global chemical enrichment may often mask and mimic population-scale signatures of planet-related processes.</description>

      <title>Weakened Magnetic Braking Signals the Collapse of the Global Stellar Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakened magnetic braking (WMB) was originally proposed in 2016 to explain anomalously rapid rotation in old field stars observed by the Kepler mission. The proximate cause was suggested to be a transition in magnetic morphology from larger to smaller spatial scales. In a series of papers over the past five years, we have collected spectropolarimetric measurements to constrain the large-scale magnetic fields for a sample of stars spanning this transition, including a range of spectral types from late F to early K. During this time, we gradually improved our methods for estimating the wind braking torque in each of our targets, and for evaluating the associated uncertainties. Here, we reanalyze the entire sample with a focus on uniformity for the relevant observational inputs. We supplement the sample with two additional active stars to provide more context for the evolution of wind braking torque with stellar Rossby number (Ro). The results demonstrate unambiguously that standard spin-down models can reproduce the evolution of wind braking torque for active stars, but WMB is required to explain the subsequent abrupt decrease in torque as Ro approaches a critical value for dynamo excitation. This transition is seen in both the large-scale magnetic field and the X-ray luminosity, indicating weakened coronal heating. We interpret these transitions as evidence of a rotational threshold for the influence of Coriolis forces on global convective patterns and the resulting inefficiency of the global stellar dynamo.</description>

      <title>The ODYSSEUS Survey. Using accretion and stellar rotation to reveal the star-disk connection in T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit strong variability over timescales of minutes to decades. However, much theoretical work assumes that CTTS are in stable spin states. Here, we test expectations for CTTS angular momentum regulation by comparing star and disk rotation. We measure stellar rotation periods and disk corotation radii ($R_{\rm co}$) for 47 CTTS from the HST ULLYSES sample. We compare $R_{\rm co}$ to the magnetospheric truncation radii ($R_{\rm i}$) and show that most CTTS are in the spin-up regime based on model predictions, which may indicate efficient angular momentum loss processes. We find evidence of magnetospheric outflows and episodic accretion, and our observations are consistent with the presence of accretion-powered stellar winds. We confirm predictions that $R_{\rm i}$ is variable over timescales of days, causing some CTTS to cross accretion stability regime boundaries. We characterize light curve morphologies and confirm that our inclined CTTS with $R_{\rm i}\sim R_{\rm co}$ show dipper light curves, consistent with expectations from disk warp models. However, dippers occur at all values of $R_{\rm i}/R_{\rm co}$, suggesting that they do not need to be near the propeller regime. Finally, we show that our measured $R_{\rm i}$ locations are consistent with observed ultra-short-period planet (USP) semi-major axes. If USPs are stable against tidal dissipation, as has been suggested in the literature, then our work provides a plausible USP formation channel. These results show that the star-disk connection produces a large variety of accretion and stellar spin configurations, most of which are likely not in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The Spin-orbit alignment of two short period eclipsing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of TESS photometry and radial velocity measurements obtained from the Minerva-Australis facility for two short-period eclipsing binaries, TIC 48227288 and TIC 339607421. TIC 339607421 hosts an M-dwarf companion ($M_B = 0.294 \pm 0.013 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.291 \pm 0.006 \: R_{\odot}$) orbiting an F6V star ($M_A=1.09 \pm 0.04 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_A=1.21^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \: R_{\odot}$). While TIC 48227288 contains a late K class companion ($M_B=0.635 \pm 0.037 \: M_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.605 \pm 0.011 \: R_{\odot}$) orbiting an F3V star ($M_A = 1.36^{+0.06}_{-0.08} \: M_{\odot}$, $R_A = 1.61 \pm 0.03 \: R_{\odot}$). Both companions follow short period, near-circular orbits ($P_B = 2.4-3.0$ d, $e \approx 0.001$). Sky-projected obliquities for each system were derived using a classical analysis of the RV perturbation and the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin (RRM) technique. The classical method indicates minor spin-orbit misalignment for both systems ($\lambda_A = -14.7^{+5.4}_{-5.9}$ deg and $-17.8^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ deg for TIC 339607421 and TIC 48227288, respectively). The RRM analysis yields smaller obliquities ($\lambda_A = -8.2 \pm 0.2$ deg and $-9.5 \pm 0.2$ deg respectively), but confirms the minor misalignment inferred from the classical analysis. The findings of misaligned, circular orbits are notable even though the misalignments are not large, and suggest potential gaps in current models of binary formation and orbital evolution. As such, further investigation of these and similar systems appears warranted.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary MML 48</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the eclipsing binary MML 48, which is a member of Upper Centaurus Lupus, has an associated age of 16 Myr, and is composed of two young, low-mass stars. We used space- and ground-based observations to characterize the system with both time-series photometry and spectroscopy. Given the extreme mass ratio between the stars, q_EB = 0.209 +- 0.014, we modeled a single-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system. The orbital period, 2.0171068 +- 0.0000004 d, is measured from the highest precision light curves. We derive a primary mass of 1.2 +- 0.07 Msun using stellar models, and with radial velocities we measured a secondary mass of 0.2509 +- 0.0078 Msun. The radii are large, as expected for pre-main-sequence stars, and are measured as 1.574 +- 0.026 +- 0.050 Rsun and 0.587 +- 0.0095 +- 0.050 Rsun, for the primary and secondary stars, respectively. MML 48 joins the short list of known low-mass, pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs), being one of only five systems with intermediate ages (15-25 Myr), and the system with the most extreme mass ratio. The primary star is currently at the "fusion bump", undergoing an over-production of energy in the core due to the build-up of 3He before reaching its equilibrium abundance set by the proton-proton (p-p) I chain. MML 48 A is the first young star in an eclipsing system that has been found during its fusion bump. MML 48 is thus an important benchmark for low-mass stellar evolution at a time when the stars are rapidly changing, which allows for a tight constraint on the corresponding isochrone given the uneven mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Rubin Data Preview 1: Extending the View of Unresolved Binary Stars in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until now, the study of unresolved main sequence binary stars in globular clusters has been possible almost exclusively in their central regions with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We present the first detection of unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs. $g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius, reaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to identify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived binary fraction of $f_\mathrm{bin}(q&gt;0.7) = 0.016 \pm 0.005$ stands in contrast to the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured from HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in globular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and high-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of outstanding questions in star cluster research. Future full data releases will enable to significantly expand the study of dense stellar systems across the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>New Arabic records from Cairo on supernovae 1181 and 1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181 is under discussion: While the previously suggested G130.7+3.1 (3C58) appears too old (3000-5000 yr), the unusual star IRAS 00500+6713 with a surrounding nebula (Pa-30) has an expansion age not inconsistent with a SN Iax explosion in AD 1181 under the assumption that neither acceleration nor deceleration occurred. Previously, only reports from China and Japan were known, pointing to an event near the northern circumpolar region. Any further reports from other cultures can therefore be highly relevant. We present here an Arabic poem in praise of Saladin by the contemporaneous author Ibn San\=a' al-Mulk (Cairo, Egypt). We re-date its composition to between Dec 1181 and May 1182. It contains a new bright star, which can be identified as SN 1181. The poem also provides new and independent information on the object type (called `najm' for `star'), location on sky (in or near the Arabic constellation al-Kaff al-Khab\=ib, lit. the henna-dyed hand (five bright stars in Cassiopeia), and brightness (brighter than alpha Cas, 2.25 mag). In addition, we present another Arabic text on SN 1006, also from Cairo, by the historian al-Maqr\=iz\=i, probably based on the contemporaneous al-Musabbih\=i</description>

      <title>Disentangling Vortex-driven Dynamics in the Solar Atmosphere Using Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar tornadoes are believed to influence plasma dynamics and create conditions for heating, yet a direct quantitative link is lacking. Here, for the first time, we directly measure vortex-driven dynamics using information-theoretic diagnostics in a Bifrost simulation. By combining Shannon Entropy (SE) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we track how vortices restructure plasma-magnetic interactions and channel energy into heat. The vortex flow originates in the upper photosphere and extends into the chromosphere and upper atmosphere. Relative to a control region dominated by shear flows and transient swirls, the coherent vortex shows stronger statistical interdependence between vorticity and other MHD variables. SE shows that vertical magnetic field entropy increases at the vortex onset as magnetic flux is redistributed, then decreases as the field becomes ordered. Magnetic shear and magnetic energy entropy peak during vortex development, reflecting current and energy build-up. In the upper atmosphere, low entropy in temperature and pressure alongside high entropy in density indicates ordered thermal and pressure fields but irregular mass distribution, a departure from ideal-gas behavior confirmed by weakened temperature-density coupling. NMI shows that temperature couples to different heating drivers with height: compression and vorticity (viscous heating, since vorticity traces velocity gradients) in the lower atmosphere, and vorticity plus magnetic shear in the upper atmosphere (viscous and current-driven heating). Although the simulation does not include explicit physical dissipation, hyperdiffusivity acts on sharp gradients and mimics these processes. Our results demonstrate that vortices drive multiscale coupling between flows and fields, locally shaping solar atmospheric dynamics and heating</description>

      <title>SN 2019hnl: A Type IIP Supernova with a Partially Stripped, Low Mass Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019hnl. Discovered within ~26 hr of explosion by the ATLAS survey, SN 2019hnl is a typical Type IIP supernova with a peak absolute V band magnitude of -16.7+-0.1 mag, a plateau length of ~107 days, and an early decline rate of 0.0086+-0.0006 mag (50 days)^-1. We use nebular spectroscopy and hydrodynamic modeling with the SNEC, MESA, and STELLA codes to infer that the progenitor of SN 2019hnl was a M_ZAMS ~ 11M_solar red supergiant which produced 0.047+-0.007M_solar of 56Ni in the explosion. As a part of our hydrodynamic modeling, we reduced hydrogen envelope mass by scaling the mass loss within the "Dutch" wind scheme to fit our light curve, showing that the progenitor of a relatively typical Type IIP SN may experience partial stripping during their evolution and establish massive (~0.2M_solar) CSM environments prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>Second-Generation Planet Formation in Post-AGB Discs: Testing the Role of Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binary stars are evolved systems that host circumbinary discs formed through mass loss during late-stage binary interaction. Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to planet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as sites of "second-generation" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether the gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet formation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the Toomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size, mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several well-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks were stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk mass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases early on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the post-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under specific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc mass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in these systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such as core accretion-in future studies</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>

      <title>What determines the brightness of magnetically open solar corona?: Insights from three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations and observations</title>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the Solar Cycle from Maunder-like Grand Minima Episodes: A Quantification of the Necessary Polar Flux Threshold through Solar Dynamo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 11-yr cycle of sunspots undergo amplitude modulation over longer timescales. As a part of this long-term modulation in solar activity, the decennial rhythm occasionally breaks, with quiescent phases with very few sunspots observed over multiple decades. These episodes are termed as solar grand minima. Observation of solar magnetic activity proxies complemented by solar dynamo simulations suggests that the large-scale solar polar fields become very weak during these minima phases with a temporary halt in the polar field reversal. Eventually, with the accumulation of sufficient polar fluxes, the polarity reversal and regular cyclic activity is thought to resume, Using multi-millennial dynamo simulations with stochastic forcing, we quantify the polar flux threshold necessary to recover global solar polarity reversal and surmount grand minima phases. We find that the duration of a grand minimum is independent of the onset rate and does not affect the recovery rate. Our results suggest a method to forecast the Sun's recovery from a grand minima phase. However, based on our approach, we could not identify specific precursors that signal entry in to a grand minima phase -- implying that predicting the onset of grand minima remains an outstanding challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved observations of the Sun and the astronomical sample size of stellar bodies are the respective key strengths of solar and stellar observations. However, the large difference in object brightness between the Sun and other stars has led to distinctly different instrumentation and methodologies between the two fields. We produce and analyze synthetic full-disk spectra derived from 19 small area field-of-view optical observations of solar flares acquired by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) between 2011 and 2024. These are used to investigate what can and cannot be inferred about physical processes on the Sun from Sun-as-a-star observations. The recently released Numerical Empirical Sun-as-a-Star Integrator (NESSI) code provides synthetic full-disk integrated spectral line emission based on smaller field-of-view input, accounting for center-to-limb variations and differential rotation. We use this code to generate pseudo-Sun-as-a-star spectra from the SST observations. ...</description>

      <title>Confined Circumstellar Material as a Dust Formation Site in Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. We use the rapid binary population synthesis suite COMPAS to model the Galactic population of canonical pulsars. We account for both radio and gamma-ray selection effects, as well as the motion of pulsars in the Galactic potential due to natal kicks. We compare our models to the catalogues of pulsars detected in the radio, and those detected in gamma-rays by Fermi, and find broad agreement with both populations. We reproduce the observed ratio of radio-loud to radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. We further examine the possibility of low spin-down luminosity (Edot) pulsars emitting weak, unpulsed gamma-ray emission and attempt to match this with results from a recent gamma-ray stacking survey of these pulsars. We confirm the correlation between the latitude of a pulsar and its Edot arises due to natal kicks imparted to pulsars at birth, assuming that all pulsars are born in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the weak mixing angle using direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current ton-scale dark matter direct detection experiments have reached an important milestone with the detection of solar neutrinos. In this paper, we show that these data can be used to determine a critical parameter of the Standard Model in particle physics, across an energy regime that has never been probed before. In particular, we show that the value of the weak mixing angle ($\theta_W$) which relates the mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons can be derived from 1) the recent measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by PandaX-4T and XENONnT in the sub-GeV energy range -- a regime which is usually only probed by low energy neutrino experiments -- and from 2) XENONnT electron recoil data through neutrino-electron scattering at energy scale $\simeq 0.1 ~ \rm{ MeV}$, corresponding to a momentum transfer region over an order of magnitude smaller than that explored by atomic parity violation experiments. Now that an indicative measurement of the weak mixing angle exists at these lowest energy frontier, the challenge for the next generation of such experiments will be to provide a more precise measurement in the keV-MeV energy range.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Protostellar disks in their natural habitat -- the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>
