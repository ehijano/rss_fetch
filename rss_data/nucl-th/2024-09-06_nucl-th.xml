      <title>Three-body model of $^{6}$He with non-local halo effective field theory potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $^6$He Borromean nucleus in coordinate representation within a three-body model with two-body potentials derived from cluster effective field theory (EFT). These potentials are originally developed in momentum space and Fourier transformed to provide non-local potentials in configuration space. We use hyperspherical coordinates in combination with the Lagrange-mesh technique to compute the ground state energy, root mean square radius and the E1 strength distribution of $^6$He. We also introduce a three-body interaction to eliminate dependencies on the cutoff parameter of the two-body potentials on the ground state energy. The E1 strength distribution exhibits a low lying resonance as expected. However it is strongly influenced by the choice of the three-body EFT interaction.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the influence of neutron transfer in Si-based fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We aim to investigate the role of a few neutron transfer channels on the dynamics of fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier by judicially selecting 11 different $^{28,30}$Si-induced systems. These reactions are chosen in such a way that they possess positive and negative Q-values for neutron transfer channels to make the comparison more apparent. Furthermore, a comparative study on fusion barrier parameters using different proximity potentials and parametrizations is also a prime goal.
  Method: A channel coupling approach within the framework of a semiclassical model is being used to investigate the role of multi-neutron transfer with positive Q-values on fusion phenomena near and below the Coulomb barrier. The fusion barrier parameters have been extracted and analyzed within the framework of seven different potential models.
  Results: The sub-barrier fusion enhancement compared to the one-dimensional barrier penetration model (uncoupled) is investigated by considering collective excitations in colliding nuclei and multi-neutron transfer channels with Q $&gt;$ 0 within the channel coupling model. Furthermore, GRAZING calculations are performed to predict the cross-section of target-like fragments after 2n pickup transfer.
  Conclusion: All the fusion excitation functions (EFs) have been successfully explained by the coupled channel calculations using the channel coupling model. Only the significant effect of up to 2n pickup transfer with Q $&gt;$ 0 was found on sub-barrier fusion. Despite having positive Q values for transfer channels, no noticeable impact of more than 2n transfer was observed. GRAZING predictions are grossly in the same order as the quantitative contribution of 2n transfer channels observed by channel coupling model calculations.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable bound-to-resonance extrapolations for few- and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open quantum many-body systems, the theoretical description of resonant states of many particles strongly coupled to the continuum can be challenging. Such states are commonplace in, for example, exotic nuclei and hadrons, and can reveal important information about the underlying forces at play in these systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the complex-augmented eigenvector continuation (CA-EC) method, originally formulated for the two-body problem with uniform complex scaling, can reliably perform bound-to-resonance extrapolations for genuine three-body resonances having no bound subsystems. We first establish that three-body bound-to-resonance extrapolations are possible by benchmarking different few-body approaches, and we provide arguments to explain how the extrapolation works in the many-body case. We furthermore pave the way towards scalable resonance extrapolations in many-body systems by showing that the CA-EC method also works in the Berggren basis, studying a realistic application using the Gamow shell model.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the correlation, relativistic and QED corrections to the total electron binding energy in atoms and their nuclear charge dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present relativistic many-body calculations of total electron binding energy of neutral atoms up to element $Z=120$. Binding energy for ions may be found by subtracting known ionization potentials. Accuracy of the results for $17&lt;Z \le105$ significantly exceeds that in NIST tables (there are no data for $Z&gt;105$ there). We fit numerical results for binding energies by analytical function of $Z$. We also calculate numerical values and determine dependence on $Z$ of the correlation corrections, Dirac and Breit relativistic corrections and quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections.</description>

      <title>JuliaQCD: Portable lattice QCD package in Julia language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new lattice gauge theory code set JuliaQCD using the Julia language. Julia is well-suited for integrating machine learning techniques and enables rapid prototyping and execution of algorithms for four dimensional QCD and other non-Abelian gauge theories. The code leverages LLVM for high-performance execution and supports MPI for parallel computations. Julia's multiple dispatch provides a flexible and intuitive framework for development. The code implements existing algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), many color and flavor, supports lattice fermions, smearing techniques, and full QCD simulations. It is designed to run efficiently across various platforms, from laptops to supercomputers, allowing for seamless scalability. The code set is currently available on GitHub https://github.com/JuliaQCD.</description>

      <title>High Energy Physics from Low Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation between physics at low and high energies is essential for physics to have any utility; the details of quantum gravity are not necessary to calculate the trajectory of a cannon ball. However, physics at low and high energies are not completely independent, and this thesis explores two ways that they are related. The first is through a UV/IR symmetry that relates scattering processes at low and high energies. This UV/IR symmetry manifests in geometrical properties of the $S$-matrix, and of the RG flow of the coupling constants in the corresponding effective field theory. Low energy nuclear physics nearly realizes this UV/IR symmetry, providing an explanation for the smallness of shape parameters in the effective range expansion of nucleon-nucleon scattering, and inspiring a new way to organize the interactions between neutrons and protons. The second is through the use of quantum computers to simulate lattice gauge theories. Quantum simulations rely on the universality of the rules of quantum mechanics, which can be applied equally well to describe a (low energy) transmon qubit at 15 milli-Kelvin as a (high energy) 1 TeV quark. This thesis presents the first simulations of one dimensional lattice quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer, culminating in a real-time simulation of beta-decay. Results from the first simulations of a lattice gauge theory on 100+ qubits of a quantum computer are also presented. The methods developed in this thesis for quantum simulation are ``physics-aware", and are guided by the symmetries and hierarchies in length scales of the systems being studied. Without these physics-aware methods, 100+ qubit simulations of lattice gauge theories would not have been possible on the noisy quantum computers that are presently available.</description>

      <title>Search for singly charmed dibaryons in baryon-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the singly charmed dibaryon system with strangeness numbers $S=-1$, $-3$ and $-5$ in the framework of the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness numbers $S=-1$ are obtained in the baryon-baryon scattering process. In the $\Lambda\Lambda_{c}$ scattering phase shifts, the $\Sigma\Sigma_{c}$ appears as a resonance state with the mass and width 3591 MeV and 11.1 MeV, respectively. In the $N\Xi_{c}$ and $N\Xi^{\prime}_{c}$ scattering phase shifts, the $\Sigma\Sigma^{\ast}_{c}$ exhibits as a resonance state with the mass and width 3621-3624 MeV and 14.9 MeV, respectively. All these heavy-flavor dibaryons are worth searching for in experiments. Besides, we would like to emphasize that the coupling calculation between the bound channels and open channels is indispensable. The study of the scattering process maybe an effective way to look for the genuine resonances.</description>

      <title>Possible bound states of Heavy Baryonium and Heavy Dibaryon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the heavy baryonium and heavy dibaryon systems using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder and instantaneous approximations for the kernel. Our results indicate that all the heavy baryonium systems, specifically $\Lambda_Q\bar{\Lambda}_Q$, $\Xi_Q\bar{\Xi}_Q$, $\Sigma_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$, $\Xi'_Q\bar{\Xi}'_Q$, and $\Omega_Q\bar{\Omega}_Q$ ($Q=c, b$), can form bound states. Among the heavy dibaryon systems, only the $\Xi_Q\Xi_Q$ system with $I=0$ and the $\Sigma_Q\Sigma_Q$ systems with $I=0$ and $I=1$ can exist as bound states. Additionally, the $\Sigma_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$ system with $I=2$ and the $\Sigma_Q\Sigma_Q$ system with $I=1$ are not deeply bound.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark bound and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the energy spectrum of the S-wave doubly heavy tetraquark systems, including the $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$, $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar q$, and $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar s$ ($Q^{(\prime)}=b,c$ and $q=u,d$) systems within the constituent quark model. We use the complex scaling method to obtain bound states and resonant states simultaneously, and the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled four-body Schr\"odinger equation. With a novel definition of the root-mean-square radii, we are able to distinguish between meson molecules and compact tetraquark states. The compact tetraquarks are further classified into three different types with distinct spatial configurations: compact even tetraquarks, compact diquark-antidiquark tetraquarks and compact diquark-centered tetraquarks. In the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $QQ\bar q\bar q$ system, there exists the $ D^*D $ molecular bound state with a binding energy of $ -14 $ MeV, which is the candidate for $ T_{cc}(3875)^+ $. The shallow $\bar B^*\bar B$ molecular bound state is the bottom analogue of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. Moreover, we identify two resonant states near the $D^*D^*$ and $\bar B^*\bar B^*$ thresholds. In the $ J^P=1^+ $ $bb\bar q\bar q\,(I=0)$ and $bb\bar s\bar q$ systems, we obtain deeply bound states with a compact diquark-centered tetraquark configuration and a dominant $\chi_{\bar 3_c\otimes 3_c}$ component, along with resonant states with similar configurations as their radial excitations. These states are the QCD analogue of the helium atom. We also obtain some other bound states and resonant states with ``QCD Hydrogen molecule" configurations. Moreover, we investigate the heavy quark mass dependence of the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $ QQ\bar q\bar q $ bound states. We strongly urge the experimental search for the predicted states.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Simulating Fermions, Bosons, and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S))$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work establishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as a viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Pion electroproduction measurements in the nucleon resonance region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new pion electroproduction measurements in the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance, utilizing the SHMS - HMS magnetic spectrometers of Hall C at Jefferson Lab. The data focus on a region that exhibits a strong and rapidly changing interplay of the mesonic cloud and quark-gluon dynamics in the nucleon. The results are in reasonable agreement with models that employ pion cloud effects and chiral effective field theory calculations, but at the same time they suggest that an improvement is required to the theoretical calculations and provide valuable input that will allow their refinements. The data illustrate the potential of the magnetic spectrometers setup in Hall C towards the study the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. These first reported results will be followed by a series of measurements in Hall C, that will expand the studies of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance offering a high precision insight within a wide kinematic range from low to high momentum transfers.</description>

      <title>Global Data-Driven Determination of Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equation: derivation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Final State Gluon Emission in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at Next-to-Leading Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed reanalysis of the single gluon emission rate at next-to-leading twist is carried out. As was the case in prior efforts, the problem is cast in the framework of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) of an electron off a large nucleus. The quark produced in the interaction propagates through the remaining nucleus and engenders scattering and gluon radiation, which is calculated in the limit of one re-scattering. This medium induced single gluon emission rate forms the basis of several energy loss calculations in both DIS and heavy-ion collisions. Unlike prior efforts, a complete transverse momentum gradient expansion of the hadronic tensor, including $N_c$ suppressed terms, phase terms and finite gluon momentum fraction terms, ignored previously, is carried out. These terms turn out to be surprisingly large. In contrast to prior efforts, the full next-to-leading twist gluon emission kernel is found to be positive definite and slowly increasing with the exchanged transverse momentum. Phenomenological consequences of these new contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>Flavor Dependence of Charged Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have measured the flavor dependence of multiplicities for pi^+ and pi^- production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on proton and deuteron targets to explore a possible charge symmetry violation in fragmentation functions. The experiment used an electron beam with energies of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV at Jefferson Lab and the Hall-C spectrometers. The electron kinematics spanned the range 0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6, 2&lt;Q^2&lt;5.5 GeV^2, and 4&lt;W^2&lt;11 GeV^2. The pion fractional momentum range was 0.3&lt; z &lt;0.7, and the transverse momentum range was 0&lt;p_T&lt;0.25 GeV/c. Assuming factorization at low p_T and allowing for isospin breaking, we find that the results can be described by two "favored" and two "un-favored" effective low $p_T$ fragmentation functions that are flavor-dependent. However, they converge to a common flavor-independent value at the lowest x or highest W of this experiment.</description>
