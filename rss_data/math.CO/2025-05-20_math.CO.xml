      <title>Maximal 2-dimensional binary words of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let d be an integer between 0 and 4, and W be a 2-dimensional word of dimensions h x w on the binary alphabet {0, 1}, where h, w in Z &gt; 0. Assume that each occurrence of the letter 1 in W is adjacent to at most d letters 1. We provide an exact formula for the maximum number of letters 1 that can occur in W for fixed (h, w). As a byproduct, we deduce an upper bound on the length of maximum snake polyominoes contained in a h x w rectangle.</description>

      <title>Rainbow triangles and the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal problem in projective geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a geometric version of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture that applies to finite projective geometries rather than graphs, in both its usual 'induced' form and the multicoloured form. The multicoloured conjecture states, roughly, that a colouring $c$ of the points of $\mathsf{PG}(n-1,q)$ containing no copy of a fixed colouring $c_0$ of $\mathsf{PG}(k-1,q)$ for small $k$ must contain a subspace of dimension polynomial in $n$ that avoids some colour.
  If $(k,q) = (2,2)$, then $c_0$ is a colouring of a three-element 'triangle', and there are three essentially different cases, all of which we resolve. We derive both the cases where $c_0$ assigns the same colour to two different elements from a recent breakthrough result in additive combinatorics due to Kelley and Meka. We handle the case that $c_0$ is a 'rainbow' colouring by proving that rainbow-triangle-free colourings of projective geometries are exactly those that admit a certain decomposition into two-coloured pieces.This is closely analogous to a theorem of Gallai on rainbow-triangle-free coloured complete graphs. We also show that existing structure theorems resolve certain two-coloured cases where $(k,q) = (2,3)$, and $(k,q) = (3,2)$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Polytopes and Pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-polytope is determined by its edge-polygon incidences, solving an open problem of Gr\"unbaum. For each $d \geq 3$, we show that not every $d$-polytope is determined by its $(d-3)$-skeleton and dual $(d-3)$-skeleton together, answering a question of Samper.
  In the simplicial realm, we prove that for $d \geq 4$ and $\lceil \frac{d}{2} \rceil \leq k \leq d-2$, every homology $(d-1)$-manifold is determined by the incidences of its $k$- and $(k-1)$-faces. For $d \geq 5$ and $\lceil \frac{d+1}{2} \rceil \leq k \leq d-2$, we extend our proof to normal $(d-1)$-pseudomanifolds whose $(2d-2k-1)$-dimensional links are homology manifolds. Finally, we prove that not every normal $(d-1)$-pseudomanifold is determined by its $(d-2)$-skeleton.</description>

      <title>On the size of the neighborhoods of a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The d-neighborhood of a word W in the Levenshtein distance is the set of all words at distance at most d from W. Generating the neighborhood of a word W, or related sets of words such as the condensed neighborhood or the super-condensed neighborhood has applications in the design of approximate pattern matching algorithms. It follows that bounds on the maximum size of the neighborhood of words of a given length can be used in the complexity analysis of such approximate pattern matching algorithms. In this note, we present exact formulas for the size of the condensed and super condensed neighborhoods of a unary word, a novel upper bound for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length, and we prove a conjectured upper bound again for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length.</description>

      <title>Deranged Perfect Matchings on complete graph and balanced complete r-partite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved that for any finite collection of sparse subgraphs $(D_m)_{m=1}^\ell$ of the complete graph $K_{2n}$, and a uniformly chosen perfect matching $R$ in $K_{2n}$, the random vector $(|E(R \cap D_m)|)_{m=1}^\ell$ jointly converges to a vector of independent Poisson random variables with mean $|E(D_m)|/(2n)$. We also showed a similar result when $K_{2n}$ is replaced by the balanced complete $r$-partite graph $K_{r \times 2n/r}$ for fixed $r$ and determined the asymptotic joint distribution. The proofs rely on elementary tools of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and generating functions. These results extend recent works of Johnston, Kayll and Palmer, Spiro and Surya, and Garnet and Joos from the univariate to the multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>Colored Vertex Models and Interacting Reverse Plane Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupling of pairs of reverse plane partitions of the same shape by assigning a certain local interaction between the reverse plane partitions. We show that they are in bijection with a certain Yang-Baxter integrable colored vertex model. By utilizing the Yang-Baxter equation for this colored vertex model, we are able to compute the generating function for the interacting pairs of reverse plane partitions. We also give a bijection between the coupled pairs of reverse plane partitions with the interaction strength set to zero and a single reverse plane partition of the same shape.</description>

      <title>On the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius, fractional matching and factors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance signless Laplacian matrix of a graph $G$ is define as $Q(G)=$Tr$(G)+D(G)$, where Tr$(G)$ and $D(G)$ are the diagonal matrix of vertex transmissions and the distance matrix of $G$, respectively. Denote by $E_G(v)$ the set of all edges incident to a vertex $v$ in $G$. A fractional matching of a graph $G$ is a function $f:E(G) \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{e\in E_G(v)} f(e)\leq 1$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. The fractional matching number $\mu_f(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum value of $ \sum_{e\in E(G)} f(e)$ over all fractional matchings. Given subgraphs $H_1, H_2,...,H_k$ of $G$, a $\{H_1, H_2,...,H_k\}$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ in which each connected component is isomorphic to one of $H_1, H_2,...,H_k$. In this paper, we establish a upper bound for the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius of a graph $G$ of order $n$ to guarantee that $\mu_f(G)&gt; \frac{n-k}{2}$, where $1\leq k&lt;n$ is an integer. Besides, we also provide a sufficient condition based on distance signless Laplacian spectral radius to guarantee the existence of a $\{K_2,\{C_k\}\}$-factor in a graph, where $k \geq 3$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>A composition theory for upward planar orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An upward planar order on an acyclic directed graph $G$ is a special linear extension of the edge poset of $G$ that satisfies the nesting condition. This order was introduced to combinatorially characterize upward plane graphs and progressive plane graphs (commonly known as plane string diagrams). In this paper, motivated by the theory of graphical calculus for monoidal categories, we establish a composition theory for upward planar orders. The main result is that the composition of upward planar orders is an upward planar order. This theory provides a practical method to calculate the upward planar order of a progressive plane graph or an upward plane graph.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic rigidity property from the realizability of chirotope extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a finite full-dimensional point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if a point configuration $Q$ has the property that all finite chirotopes realizable by adding (generic) points to $P$ are also realizable by adding points to $Q$, then $P$ and $Q$ are equal up to a direct affine transform. We also show that for any point configuration $P$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a finite, (generic) extension $\widehat P$ of $P$ with the following property: if another realization $Q$ of the chirotope of $P$ can be extended so as to realize the chirotope of $\widehat P$, then there exists a direct affine transform that maps each point of $Q$ within distance $\varepsilon$ of the corresponding point of $P$.</description>

      <title>Even-up words and their variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by OEIS sequence A377912, which consists of the nonnegative integers in which every even digit (except possibly the last) is immediately followed by a strictly larger digit, we define even-up and odd-up words over an alphabet of size~$k$ via similar constraints. We introduce and analyze weak and cyclic variants of these words, deriving explicit generating functions for all eight resulting classes. We then study Catalan words under analogous restrictions. Our results provide new combinatorial interpretations for many integer sequences, including the Motzkin numbers, the Riordan numbers, and the generalized Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>On problems in extremal multigraph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multigraph G is said to be an (s,q)-graph if every s-set of vertices in G supports at most q edges (counting multiplicities). In this paper we consider the maximal sum and product of edge multiplicities in an (s,q)-graph on n vertices. These are multigraph analogues of a problem of Erd\H{o}s raised by F\"uredi and K\"undgen and Mubayi and Terry respectively, with applications to counting problems and extremal hypergraph theory.
  We make major progress, settling conjectures of Day, Falgas-Ravry and Treglown and of Falgas-Ravry, establishing intricate behaviour for both the sum and the product problems, and providing both a general picture and evidence that the problems may prove computationally intractable in general.</description>

      <title>The largest sets of non-opposite chambers in spherical buildings of type $B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation into large families of non-opposite flags in finite spherical buildings has been a recent addition to a long line of research in extremal combinatorics, extending classical results in vector and polar spaces. This line of research falls under the umbrella of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) problems, but poses some extra difficulty on the algebraic level compared to aforementioned classical results. From the building theory point of view, it can be seen as a variation of the center conjecture for spherical buildings due to Tits, where we replace the convexity assumption by a maximality condition.
  In previous work, general upper bounds on the size of families of non-opposite flags were obtained by applying eigenvalue and representation-theoretic techniques to the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of non-exceptional buildings. More recently, the classification of families reaching this upper bound in type $A_n$, for $n$ odd, was accomplished by Heering, Lansdown, and Metsch. For buildings of type $B$, the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra is more complicated and depends non-trivially on the type and rank of the underlying polar space. Nevertheless, we are able to find a uniform method based on antidesigns and obtain classification results for chambers (i.e.\ maximal flags) in all cases, except type $^2A_{4n-3}$.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Tur\'an problems for a matching and any other graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a family of graphs $\cF$, a graph is called $\cF$-free if it does not contain any member of $\cF$ as a subgraph. Given a collection of graphs $(G_1,\ldots,G_t)$ on the same vertex set $V$ of size $n$, a rainbow graph on $V$ is obtained by taking at most one edge from each $G_i$. We say that a collection is rainbow $\cF$-free if it contains no rainbow copy of any member of $\cF$. In this paper, we study the maximum values of $min_{i\in [t]}|E(G_i)|$, $\sum_{i=1}^{t}|E(G_i)|$ and $\prod_{i=1}^{t}|E(G_i)|$ among rainbow $\{F,M_{s+1}\}$-free collections $(G_1,\ldots,G_t)$ on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set-system $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ is cube-ideal if its convex hull can be described by capacity and generalized set covering inequalities. In this paper, we use combinatorics, convex geometry, and polyhedral theory to give exponential lower bounds on the size of cube-ideal set-systems, and linear lower bounds on their VC dimension. We then provide applications to graph theory and combinatorial optimization, specifically to strong orientations, perfect matchings, dijoins, and ideal clutters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic behaviour of $\mu(G(n,p))$, the number of unlabelled induced subgraphs in the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$, for almost the entire range of the probability parameter $p=p(n)\in[0,1]$. In particular, we show that typically the number of subgraphs becomes exponential when $p$ passes $1/n$, reaches maximum possible base of exponent (asymptotically) when $p\gg 1/n$, and reaches the asymptotic value $2^n$ when $p$ passes $2\ln n/n$. For $p\gg \ln n/n$, we get the first order term and asymptotics of the second order term of $\mu(G(n,p))$. We also prove that random regular graphs $G_{n,d}$ typically have $\mu(G_{n,d})\geq 2^{c_d n}$ for all $d\geq 3$ and some positive constant $c_d$ such that $c_d\to 1$ as $d\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following recent work on the VC-dimension of subsets of various pseudorandom graphs, we study the VC-dimension of Hamming graphs, which have proved somewhat resistant to the standard techniques in the literature. Our methods are elementary, and agree with or improve upon previously known results. In particular, for $H(2,q)$ we show tight bounds on the size of a subset of vertices to guarantee VC-dimension 2 or 3. We also prove an assortment of results for other parameters, with many of these being tight as well.</description>

      <title>The Saxl hypergraph of a permutation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G \le \mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$, a subset $B$ of $\Omega$ is said to be a base if its pointwise stabiliser in $G$ is trivial, and the base size $b(G)$ is the minimum size of a base. In the notable case $b(G) = 2$, Burness and Giudici define the Saxl graph of $G$ to be the graph on $\Omega$ with bases of size 2 as edges. Later work of Freedman et al. extends this notion to any group for which $b(G) \ge 2$, taking the pairs of points contained in bases of size $b(G)$ for edges. We study an alternative generalisation, the Saxl hypergraph, where bases of size $b(G)$ are themselves the edges. In particular, we consider groups with complete Saxl hypergraphs, primitive groups whose Saxl hypergraphs have flag-spanning tours, and appropriate generalisations of Burness and Giudici's Common Neighbour Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$. This partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theoretical Computer Science 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] and a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished). Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>

      <title>The $abc$ conjecture is true almost always</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\rm rad}(n)$ denote the product of distinct prime factors of an integer $n\geq 1$. The celebrated $abc$ conjecture asks whether every solution to the equation $a+b=c$ in triples of coprime integers $(a,b,c)$ must satisfy ${\rm rad}(abc) &gt; K_\varepsilon\, c^{1-\varepsilon}$, for some constant $K_\varepsilon&gt;0$. In this expository note, we present a classical estimate of de Bruijn that implies almost all such triples satisfy the $abc$ conjecture, in a precise quantitative sense. Namely, there are at most $O(N^{2/3})$ many triples of coprime integers in a cube $(a,b,c)\in\{1,\ldots,N\}^3$ satisfying $a+b=c$ and ${\rm rad}(abc) &lt; c^{1-\varepsilon}$. The proof is elementary and essentially self-contained. Beyond revisiting a classical argument for its own sake, this exposition is aimed to contextualize a new result of Browning, Lichtman, and Ter\"av\"ainen, who prove a refined estimate $O(N^{33/50})$, giving the first power-savings since 1962.</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chern character operators on the equivariant cohomology of the Hilbert schemes of points in the complex affine plane $C^2$ with the action of the torus $(C^*)^2$, and partially verify Okounkov's Conjecture [Oko, Conjecture 2] in this setting. Our main idea is to apply the connection between the equivariant cohomology of these Hilbert schemes and the ring of symmetric functions, via the deformed vertex operators of Cheng and Wang [CW], (the integral form of) the Jack symmetric functions and the transformed Macdonald symmetric functions of Garsia and Haiman [GH, Hai].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LLT polynomials $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{\beta}/\mathbf{\gamma}} (X;t)$ are a family of symmetric polynomials indexed by a tuple of (possibly skew-)partitions $\mathbf{\beta}/\mathbf{\gamma}= (\beta^{(1)}/\gamma^{(1)},\ldots,\beta^{(k)}/\gamma^{(k)})$. It has recently been shown that these polynomials can be seen as the partition function of a certain vertex model whose boundary conditions are determined by $\mathbf{\beta}/\mathbf{\gamma}$. In this paper we describe an algorithm which gives a bijection between the configurations of the vertex model with boundary condition $\mathbf{\beta}/\mathbf{\gamma} = (\beta^{(1)}/\gamma^{(1)},\beta^{(2)}/\gamma^{(2)})$ and those with boundary condition $(\mathbf{\beta}/\mathbf{\gamma})_{swap} = (\beta^{(2)}/\gamma^{(2)},\beta^{(1)}/\gamma^{(1)})$. We prove a sufficient condition for when this bijection is weight-preserving up to an overall factor of $t$, which in turn implies that the corresponding LLT polynomials are equal up to the same overall factor. Using these techniques, we are also able to systematically determine linear relations within families of LLT polynomials.</description>

      <title>Embeddable of hieroglyphs into torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in finding combinatorial criteria for embedding graphs into torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known fact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops and is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs in some surface is equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph with rotation structure (not necessarily geometric) or rotation graph called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph in the torus; (2) the absence of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ that recognizes embedding hieroglyph in the torus.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of chain algebra, originally defined in \cite{GN} for finite distributive lattices, to that of finite pure posets. We show this algebra corresponds to the Ehrhart ring of a (0,1)-polytope, termed the chain polytope, and characterize the indecomposability of this polytope. Furthermore, we prove the normality of the chain algebra, describe its canonical module, and extend one of main results from \cite{GN} by computing its Krull dimension. For width-2 pure posets, we determine the algebra's regularity and conditions for it to be Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several known constructions relate initial degenerations of projective toric varieties and Grassmannians to regular subdivisions of appropriate point configurations. We define a general framework which allows for partial generalizations of these constructions to arbitrary projective schemes (as well as their very affine parts). We associate a point configuration $A$ with any homogeneous ideal $I$. We obtain upper and lower bounds on every initial ideal of $I$, defining them in terms of the regular subdivision of $A$ given by the same weight. Furthermore, both bounds are interpreted categorically via (co)limits over the face poset of the subdivision. We also investigate when these bounds are exact, showing that the respective weights form a subfan in the secondary fan of $A$.</description>

      <title>On the properties of claw-free 1-planar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete bipartite graph $K_{1,3}$ is called a claw. The properties of claw-free graphs have attracted considerable attention, with research on claw-free planar graphs tracing back to Plummer's work in 1989. In this paper, we extend this line of research by establishing some fundamental results for claw-free 1-planar graphs, focusing on upper bounds for maximum degree and vertex-connectivity. We show that the maximum degree of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 10, and the bound is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for 6-connected 1-planar graphs and optimal 1-planar graphs under the constraint of forbidding induced claws, the maximum degree has the better upper bound 8. Finally, we show that every 7-connected 1-planar graph contains an induced claw, thereby implying that the vertex-connectivity of claw-free 1-planar graphs is at most 6. For a better comparison, we also refine some known results by Plummer on claw-free planar graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study representation stability in the sense of Church, Ellenberg, and Farb \cite{FI-module} through the lens of symmetric function theory and the different symmetric function bases. We show that a sequence, $(F_n)_n$, where $F_n$ is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree $n$, has stabilizing Schur coefficients if and only if it has stabilizing monomial coefficients. More generally, we develop a framework for checking when stabilizing coefficients transfer from one symmetric function basis to another. We also see how one may compute representation stable ranges from the monomial expansions of the $F_n$.\parspace
  As applications, we reprove and refine the representation stability of diagonal coinvariant algebras, $DR_n$. We also observe new representation stability phenomena of the Garsia-Haiman modules. This establishes certain stability properties of the modified Macdonald polynomials, $\tilde{H}_{\mu[n]}[X;q,t]$, and the modified $q,t$-Kostka numbers, $\tilde{K}_{\mu[n],\nu[n]}(q,t)$. In an upcoming addition to the paper, these methods will be be applied to \textit{any} sequence $\tilde{H}_{\mu^{(n)}}[X;q,t]$ with $|\mu^{(n)}|=n$ and $\mu^{(n)}\subseteq \mu^{(n+1)}$.</description>

      <title>Gluing Posets and the Dichotomy of Poset Saturation Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, we say that a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but adding any other set to $\mathcal F$ creates such a copy. The induced saturation number of $\mathcal P$, denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal P)$, is the size of the smallest $\mathcal P$-saturated family with ground set $[n]$. The saturation number for posets is known to exhibit a dichotomy: it is either bounded or it has at least $\sqrt n$ rate of growth. Whether or not a poset has bounded or unbounded saturation number is not a monotone property, in the sense that if a poset is present as an induced copy in another poset, their saturation numbers are generally unrelated. Moreover, so far there is no characterization for posets that have unbounded saturation number.
  Let $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$ be two posets. We denote by $\mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1$ the poset obtained by making all of $\mathcal P_1$ strictly less than all of $\mathcal P_2$. We show that this `gluing' operation preserves both the bounded and the unbounded saturation number. More precisely, we show that, under minor assumptions, if one of the posets has unbounded saturation number, then so does $\mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1$. Moreover, if the two posets are of a certain form (special), then $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1)$ is at most linear in $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal P_1)$ and $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal P_2)$. We also give linear upper bounds for (essentially) all complete multipartite posets, and all special posets. Consequently we obtain that any finite poset can be embedded in a poset with at most linear saturation number. Moreover, we consider poset percolating families, the poset equivalent of weak saturation for graphs. We determine the exact value for the size of a minimal percolating family, for all posets.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a question of Angell, we investigate a variant of Ramsey numbers where some edges are coloured simultaneously red and blue, which we call purple. Specifically, we are interested in the largest number $g=g(n;s,t)$, for some $s$ and $t$ and $n&lt;R(s,t)$, such that there exists a red/blue/purple colouring of $K_n$ with $g$ purple edges, with no red/purple copy of $K_s$ nor blue/purple copy of $K_t$. We determine $g$ asymptotically for a large family of parameters, exhibiting strong dependencies with Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n numbers.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Identification of Stable Sheaf Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers generalizations of certain arithmetic complexes appearing in the work of Raicu and VandeBogert in connection with the study of stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties. Defined over the ring of integer valued polynomials, we prove an isomorphism of these complexes as conjectured by Gao, Raicu, and VandeBogert. In particular, this shows that a previously made identification between the stable sheaf cohomology of hook and two column partition Schur functors applied to the cotangent sheaf of projective space can be made to be uniform with respect to these complexes. These results are extended to the projective space defined over the integers.</description>

      <title>On pyramidal groups whose number of involutions is a prime power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kirkman Triple System $\Gamma$ is called $m$-pyramidal if there exists a subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group of $\Gamma$ that fixes $m$ points and acts regularly on the other points. Such group $G$ admits a unique conjugacy class $C$ of involutions (elements of order $2$) and $|C|=m$. We call groups with this property $m$-pyramidal. We prove that, if $m$ is an odd prime power $p^k$, with $p \neq 7$, then every $m$-pyramidal group is solvable if and only if either $m=9$ or $k$ is odd. The primitive permutation groups play an important role in the proof. We also determine the orders of the $m$-pyramidal groups when $m$ is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <title>Equality of tropical rank and dimension for tropical linear series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tropical rank of a semimodule of rational functions on a metric graph mirrors the concept of rank in linear algebra. Defined in terms of the maximal number of tropically independent elements within the semimodule, this quantity has remained elusive due to the challenges of computing it in practice. In this note, we establish that the tropical rank is, in fact, precisely equal to the topological dimension of the semimodule, one more than the dimension of the associated linear system of divisors. Moreover, we show that the equality of divisorial and tropical ranks in the definition of tropical linear series is equivalent to the pure dimensionality of the corresponding linear system. We conclude with several complementary results and questions on combinatorial, topological, and computability properties of the tropical rank.</description>

      <title>On minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>
