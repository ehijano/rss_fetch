      <title>Scalable Amortized GPLVMs for Single Cell Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is crucial for analyzing large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) offer an interpretable dimensionality reduction method, but current scalable models lack effectiveness in clustering cell types. We introduce an improved model, the amortized stochastic variational Bayesian GPLVM (BGPLVM), tailored for single-cell RNA-seq with specialized encoder, kernel, and likelihood designs. This model matches the performance of the leading single-cell variational inference (scVI) approach on synthetic and real-world COVID datasets and effectively incorporates cell-cycle and batch information to reveal more interpretable latent structures as we demonstrate on an innate immunity dataset.</description>

      <title>Federated Control in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study problems of federated control in Markov Decision Processes. To solve an MDP with large state space, multiple learning agents are introduced to collaboratively learn its optimal policy without communication of locally collected experience. In our settings, these agents have limited capabilities, which means they are restricted within different regions of the overall state space during the training process. In face of the difference among restricted regions, we firstly introduce concepts of leakage probabilities to understand how such heterogeneity affects the learning process, and then propose a novel communication protocol that we call Federated-Q protocol (FedQ), which periodically aggregates agents' knowledge of their restricted regions and accordingly modifies their learning problems for further training. In terms of theoretical analysis, we justify the correctness of FedQ as a communication protocol, then give a general result on sample complexity of derived algorithms FedQ-X with the RL oracle , and finally conduct a thorough study on the sample complexity of FedQ-SynQ. Specifically, FedQ-X has been shown to enjoy linear speedup in terms of sample complexity when workload is uniformly distributed among agents. Moreover, we carry out experiments in various environments to justify the efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter regularization and aggregation in the context of polynomial functional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the recent results in polynomial functional regression have been focused on an in-depth exploration of single-parameter regularization schemes. In contrast, in this study we go beyond that framework by introducing an algorithm for multiple parameter regularization and presenting a theoretically grounded method for dealing with the associated parameters. This method facilitates the aggregation of models with varying regularization parameters. The efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed through evaluations on both synthetic and some real-world medical data, revealing promising results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Set-valued Classification with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free method that wraps a given machine learning model and returns a set of plausible labels that contain the true label with a prescribed coverage rate. In practice, the empirical coverage achieved highly relies on fully observed label information from data both in the training phase for model fitting and the calibration phase for quantile estimation. This dependency poses a challenge in the context of online learning with bandit feedback, where a learner only has access to the correctness of actions (i.e., pulled an arm) but not the full information of the true label. In particular, when the pulled arm is incorrect, the learner only knows that the pulled one is not the true class label, but does not know which label is true. Additionally, bandit feedback further results in a smaller labeled dataset for calibration, limited to instances with correct actions, thereby affecting the accuracy of quantile estimation. To address these limitations, we propose Bandit Class-specific Conformal Prediction (BCCP), offering coverage guarantees on a class-specific granularity. Using an unbiased estimation of an estimand involving the true label, BCCP trains the model and makes set-valued inferences through stochastic gradient descent. Our approach overcomes the challenges of sparsely labeled data in each iteration and generalizes the reliability and applicability of conformal prediction to online decision-making environments.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Optimized by Genetic Algorithms in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02685v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of artificial neural networks in the cosmological field have shone successfully during the past decade, this is due to their great ability of modeling large amounts of datasets and complex nonlinear functions. However, in some cases, their use still remains controversial because their ease of producing inaccurate results when the hyperparameters are not carefully selected. In this paper, to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters to artificial neural networks, we propose to take advantage of the genetic algorithms. As a proof of the concept, we analyze three different cosmological cases to test the performance of the architectures achieved with the genetic algorithms and compare them with the standard process, consisting of a grid with all possible configurations. First, we carry out a model-independent reconstruction of the distance modulus using a type Ia supernovae compilation. Second, the neural networks learn to infer the equation of state for the quintessence model, and finally with the data from a combined redshift catalog the neural networks predict the photometric redshift given six photometric bands (urgizy). We found that the genetic algorithms improve considerably the generation of the neural network architectures, which can ensure more confidence in their physical results because of the better performance in the metrics with respect to the grid method.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial learning with optimal input dimension and its adaptive generator architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the input dimension on the generalization error in generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we first provide both theoretical and practical evidence to validate the existence of an optimal input dimension (OID) that minimizes the generalization error. Then, to identify the OID, we introduce a novel framework called generalized GANs (G-GANs), which includes existing GANs as a special case. By incorporating the group penalty and the architecture penalty developed in the paper, G-GANs have several intriguing features. First, our framework offers adaptive dimensionality reduction from the initial dimension to a dimension necessary for generating the target distribution. Second, this reduction in dimensionality also shrinks the required size of the generator network architecture, which is automatically identified by the proposed architecture penalty. Both reductions in dimensionality and the generator network significantly improve the stability and the accuracy of the estimation and prediction. Theoretical support for the consistent selection of the input dimension and the generator network is provided. Third, the proposed algorithm involves an end-to-end training process, and the algorithm allows for dynamic adjustments between the input dimension and the generator network during training, further enhancing the overall performance of G-GANs. Extensive experiments conducted with simulated and benchmark data demonstrate the superior performance of G-GANs. In particular, compared to that of off-the-shelf methods, G-GANs achieves an average improvement of 45.68% in the CT slice dataset, 43.22% in the MNIST dataset and 46.94% in the FashionMNIST dataset in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy or Frechet inception distance. Moreover, the features generated based on the input dimensions identified by G-GANs align with visually significant features.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Shapley for Data Selection Tasks: Misleads and Merits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Shapley provides a principled approach to data valuation and plays a crucial role in data-centric machine learning (ML) research. Data selection is considered a standard application of Data Shapley. However, its data selection performance has shown to be inconsistent across settings in the literature. This study aims to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon. We introduce a hypothesis testing framework and show that Data Shapley's performance can be no better than random selection without specific constraints on utility functions. We identify a class of utility functions, monotonically transformed modular functions, within which Data Shapley optimally selects data. Based on this insight, we propose a heuristic for predicting Data Shapley's effectiveness in data selection tasks. Our experiments corroborate these findings, adding new insights into when Data Shapley may or may not succeed.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Calibration for Biological System-of-Systems: Cell Culture Manufacturing Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomanufacturing innovation relies on an efficient design of experiments (DoE) to optimize processes and product quality. Traditional DoE methods, ignoring the underlying bioprocessing mechanisms, often suffer from a lack of interpretability and sample efficiency. This limitation motivates us to create a new optimal learning approach that can guide a sequential DoEs for digital twin model calibration. In this study, we consider a multi-scale mechanistic model for cell culture process, also known as Biological Systems-of-Systems (Bio-SoS), as our digital twin. This model with modular design, composed of sub-models, allows us to integrate data across various production processes. To calibrate the Bio-SoS digital twin, we evaluate the mean squared error of model prediction and develop a computational approach to quantify the impact of parameter estimation error of individual sub-models on the prediction accuracy of digital twin, which can guide sample-efficient and interpretable DoEs.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis on Multi-Scale Bioprocess Stochastic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the pressing challenges in the digital twin development for biomanufacturing process, we introduce an adjoint sensitivity analysis (SA) approach to expedite the learning of mechanistic model parameters. In this paper, we consider enzymatic stochastic reaction networks representing a multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model that allows us to integrate disparate data from diverse production processes and leverage the information from existing macro-kinetic and genome-scale models. To support forward prediction and backward reasoning, we develop a convergent adjoint SA algorithm studying how the perturbations of model parameters and inputs (e.g., initial state) propagate through enzymatic reaction networks and impact on output trajectory predictions. This SA can provide a sample efficient and interpretable way to assess the sensitivities between inputs and outputs accounting for their causal dependencies. Our empirical study underscores the resilience of these sensitivities and illuminates a deeper comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms behind bioprocess through sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Scalable Vertical Federated Learning via Data Augmentation and Amortized Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) has emerged as a paradigm for collaborative model estimation across multiple clients, each holding a distinct set of covariates. This paper introduces the first comprehensive framework for fitting Bayesian models in the VFL setting. We propose a novel approach that leverages data augmentation techniques to transform VFL problems into a form compatible with existing Bayesian federated learning algorithms. We present an innovative model formulation for specific VFL scenarios where the joint likelihood factorizes into a product of client-specific likelihoods. To mitigate the dimensionality challenge posed by data augmentation, which scales with the number of observations and clients, we develop a factorized amortized variational approximation that achieves scalability independent of the number of observations. We showcase the efficacy of our framework through extensive numerical experiments on logistic regression, multilevel regression, and a novel hierarchical Bayesian split neural net model. Our work paves the way for privacy-preserving, decentralized Bayesian inference in vertically partitioned data scenarios, opening up new avenues for research and applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Revisiting character-level adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in 4.84% points and the USE similarity in 8% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer.</description>

      <title>xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</description>

      <title>Minimum discrepancy principle strategy for choosing $k$ in $k$-NN regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08718v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven strategy to choose the hyperparameter $k$ in the $k$-NN regression estimator without using any hold-out data. We treat the problem of choosing the hyperparameter as an iterative procedure (over $k$) and propose using an easily implemented in practice strategy based on the idea of early stopping and the minimum discrepancy principle. This model selection strategy is proven to be minimax-optimal, under the fixed-design assumption on covariates, over some smoothness function classes, for instance, the Lipschitz functions class on a bounded domain. The novel method often improves statistical performance on artificial and real-world data sets in comparison to other model selection strategies, such as the Hold-out method, 5-fold cross-validation, and AIC criterion. The novelty of the strategy comes from reducing the computational time of the model selection procedure while preserving the statistical (minimax) optimality of the resulting estimator. More precisely, given a sample of size $n$, if one should choose $k$ among $\left\{ 1, \ldots, n \right\}$, and $\left\{ f^1, \ldots, f^n \right\}$ are the estimators of the regression function, the minimum discrepancy principle requires calculation of a fraction of the estimators, while this is not the case for the generalized cross-validation, Akaike's AIC criteria or Lepskii principle.</description>

      <title>The Role of Pseudo-labels in Self-training Linear Classifiers on High-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning method. However, why and how ST improves generalization performance by using potentially erroneous pseudo-labels is still not well understood. To deepen the understanding of ST, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss on binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The results show that ST improves generalization in different ways depending on the number of iterations. When the number of iterations is small, ST improves generalization performance by fitting the model to relatively reliable pseudo-labels and updating the model parameters by a large amount at each iteration. This suggests that ST works intuitively. On the other hand, with many iterations, ST can gradually improve the direction of the classification plane by updating the model parameters incrementally, using soft labels and small regularization. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can extract information from the data in an almost noiseless way. However, in the presence of label imbalance, the generalization performance of ST underperforms supervised learning with true labels. To overcome this, two heuristics are proposed to enable ST to achieve nearly compatible performance with supervised learning even with significant label imbalance.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Sobolev Norm Rates for the Vector-Valued Regularized Least-Squares Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first optimal rates for infinite-dimensional vector-valued ridge regression on a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L_2$ and the hypothesis space, which we consider as a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These rates allow to treat the misspecified case in which the true regression function is not contained in the hypothesis space. We combine standard assumptions on the capacity of the hypothesis space with a novel tensor product construction of vector-valued interpolation spaces in order to characterize the smoothness of the regression function. Our upper bound not only attains the same rate as real-valued kernel ridge regression, but also removes the assumption that the target regression function is bounded. For the lower bound, we reduce the problem to the scalar setting using a projection argument. We show that these rates are optimal in most cases and independent of the dimension of the output space. We illustrate our results for the special case of vector-valued Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Parameter uncertainties for imperfect surrogate models in the low-noise regime</title>

Abstract: Bayesian regression determines model parameters by minimizing the expected loss, an upper bound to the true generalization error. However, the loss ignores misspecification, where models are imperfect. Parameter uncertainties from Bayesian regression are thus significantly underestimated and vanish in the large data limit. This is particularly problematic when building models of low- noise, or near-deterministic, calculations, as the main source of uncertainty is neglected. We analyze the generalization error of misspecified, near-deterministic surrogate models, a regime of broad relevance in science and engineering. We show posterior distributions must cover every training point to avoid a divergent generalization error and design an ansatz that respects this constraint, which for linear models incurs minimal overhead. This is demonstrated on model problems before application to thousand dimensional datasets in atomistic machine learning. Our efficient misspecification-aware scheme gives accurate prediction and bounding of test errors where existing schemes fail, allowing this important source of uncertainty to be incorporated in computational workflows.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>

      <title>A Heteroskedasticity-Robust Overidentifying Restriction Test with High-Dimensional Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an overidentifying restriction test for high-dimensional linear instrumental variable models. The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number of covariates and instruments to be larger than the sample size. The test is scale-invariant and is robust to heteroskedastic errors. To construct the final test statistic, we first introduce a test based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test (Koles\'{a}r, 2018), the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates. Second, following the principle of power enhancement (Fan et al., 2015), we introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used to enhance the power to detect some extreme alternatives with many locally invalid instruments. Finally, an empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed test.</description>

      <title>The Projected Covariance Measure for assumption-lean variable significance testing</title>

Abstract: Testing the significance of a variable or group of variables $X$ for predicting a response $Y$, given additional covariates $Z$, is a ubiquitous task in statistics. A simple but common approach is to specify a linear model, and then test whether the regression coefficient for $X$ is non-zero. However, when the model is misspecified, the test may have poor power, for example when $X$ is involved in complex interactions, or lead to many false rejections. In this work we study the problem of testing the model-free null of conditional mean independence, i.e. that the conditional mean of $Y$ given $X$ and $Z$ does not depend on $X$. We propose a simple and general framework that can leverage flexible nonparametric or machine learning methods, such as additive models or random forests, to yield both robust error control and high power. The procedure involves using these methods to perform regressions, first to estimate a form of projection of $Y$ on $X$ and $Z$ using one half of the data, and then to estimate the expected conditional covariance between this projection and $Y$ on the remaining half of the data. While the approach is general, we show that a version of our procedure using spline regression achieves what we show is the minimax optimal rate in this nonparametric testing problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both in terms of maintaining Type I error control, and power, compared to several existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Class-Conditional Models under Continuous Representation Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For models consisting of a classifier in some representation space, learning online from a non-stationary data stream often necessitates changes in the representation. So, the question arises of what is the best way to adapt the classifier to shifts in representation. Current methods only slowly change the classifier to representation shift, introducing noise into learning as the classifier is misaligned to the representation. We propose DeepCCG, an empirical Bayesian approach to solve this problem. DeepCCG works by updating the posterior of a class conditional Gaussian classifier such that the classifier adapts in one step to representation shift. The use of a class conditional Gaussian classifier also enables DeepCCG to use a log conditional marginal likelihood loss to update the representation. To perform the update to the classifier and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number of examples in memory and so a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples to store, choosing the subset that minimises the KL divergence between the true posterior and the posterior induced by the subset. We explore the behaviour of DeepCCG in online continual learning (CL), demonstrating that it performs well against a spectrum of online CL methods and that it reduces the change in performance due to representation shift.</description>

      <title>Understanding MLP-Mixer as a Wide and Sparse MLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a fundamental component of deep learning, and recent MLP-based architectures, especially the MLP-Mixer, have achieved significant empirical success. Nevertheless, our understanding of why and how the MLP-Mixer outperforms conventional MLPs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal that sparseness is a key mechanism underlying the MLP-Mixers. First, the Mixers have an effective expression as a wider MLP with Kronecker-product weights, clarifying that the Mixers efficiently embody several sparseness properties explored in deep learning. In the case of linear layers, the effective expression elucidates an implicit sparse regularization caused by the model architecture and a hidden relation to Monarch matrices, which is also known as another form of sparse parameterization. Next, for general cases, we empirically demonstrate quantitative similarities between the Mixer and the unstructured sparse-weight MLPs. Following a guiding principle proposed by Golubeva, Neyshabur and Gur-Ari (2021), which fixes the number of connections and increases the width and sparsity, the Mixers can demonstrate improved performance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantile Regression with Subset Selection: A Posterior Summarization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is a powerful tool for inferring how covariates affect specific percentiles of the response distribution. Existing methods either estimate conditional quantiles separately for each quantile of interest or estimate the entire conditional distribution using semi- or non-parametric models. The former often produce inadequate models for real data and do not share information across quantiles, while the latter are characterized by complex and constrained models that can be difficult to interpret and computationally inefficient. Further, neither approach is well-suited for quantile-specific subset selection. Instead, we pose the fundamental problems of linear quantile estimation, uncertainty quantification, and subset selection from a Bayesian decision analysis perspective. For any Bayesian regression model, we derive optimal and interpretable linear estimates and uncertainty quantification for each model-based conditional quantile. Our approach introduces a quantile-focused squared error loss, which enables efficient, closed-form computing and maintains a close relationship with Wasserstein-based density estimation. In an extensive simulation study, our methods demonstrate substantial gains in quantile estimation accuracy, variable selection, and inference over frequentist and Bayesian competitors. We apply these tools to identify the quantile-specific impacts of social and environmental stressors on educational outcomes for a large cohort of children in North Carolina.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Four/Five/Six-folds as $\mathbb{P}^n_\textbf{w}$ Hypersurfaces: Machine Learning, Approximation, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau four-folds may be constructed as hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of complex dimension 5 defined via weight systems of 6 weights. In this work, neural networks were implemented to learn the Calabi-Yau Hodge numbers from the weight systems, where gradient saliency and symbolic regression then inspired a truncation of the Landau-Ginzburg model formula for the Hodge numbers of any dimensional Calabi-Yau constructed in this way. The approximation always provides a tight lower bound, is shown to be dramatically quicker to compute (with compute times reduced by up to four orders of magnitude), and gives remarkably accurate results for systems with large weights. Additionally, complementary datasets of weight systems satisfying the necessary but insufficient conditions for transversality were constructed, including considerations of the interior point, reflexivity, and intradivisibility properties. Overall producing a classification of this weight system landscape, further confirmed with machine learning methods. Using the knowledge of this classification, and the properties of the presented approximation, a novel dataset of transverse weight systems consisting of 7 weights was generated for a sum of weights $\leq 200$; producing a new database of Calabi-Yau five-folds, with their respective topological properties computed. Further to this an equivalent database of candidate Calabi-Yau six-folds was generated with approximated Hodge numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is a prominent and challenging field, driven by regulatory demands for user data deletion and heightened privacy awareness. Existing approaches involve retraining model or multiple finetuning steps for each deletion request, often constrained by computational limits and restricted data access. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate specific classes from the learned model. Our algorithm first estimates the Retain and the Forget Spaces using Singular Value Decomposition on the layerwise activations for a small subset of samples from the retain and unlearn classes, respectively. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space. Finally, we obtain the unlearned model by updating the weights to suppress the class discriminatory features from the activation spaces. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\sim 1.5\%$ drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under $1\%$ accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing $7.8\%$ improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\sim 6 \times$ more computationally efficient.

      <title>Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01404v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron &amp; Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</description>

      <title>Score identity Distillation: Exponentially Fast Distillation of Pretrained Diffusion Models for One-Step Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets, the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step, data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation. The PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Laplacian of a graph can be generalized to simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, and contains information on the topology of these structures. Even for a graph, the consideration of associated simplicial complexes is interesting to understand its shape. Whereas the Laplacian of a graph has a simple probabilistic interpretation as the generator of a continuous time Markov chain on the graph, things are not so direct when considering simplicial complexes. We define here new Markov chains on simplicial complexes. For a given order~$k$, the state space is the set of $k$-cycles that are chains of $k$-simplexes with null boundary. This new framework is a natural generalization of the canonical Markov chains on graphs. We show that the generator of our Markov chain is the upper Laplacian defined in the context of algebraic topology for discrete structure. We establish several key properties of this new process: in particular, when the number of vertices is finite, the Markov chain is positive recurrent. This result is not trivial, since the cycles can loop over themselves an unbounded number of times. We study the diffusive limits when the simplicial complexes under scrutiny are a sequence of ever refining triangulations of the flat torus. Using the analogy between singular and Hodge homologies, we express this limit as valued in the set of currents. The proof of tightness and the identification of the limiting martingale problem make use of the flat norm and carefully controls of the error terms in the convergence of the generator. Uniqueness of the solution to the martingale problem is left open. An application to hole detection is carried.</description>

      <title>Analytical Approximation of the ELBO Gradient in the Context of the Clutter Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytical solution for approximating the gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in variational inference problems where the statistical model is a Bayesian network consisting of observations drawn from a mixture of a Gaussian distribution embedded in unrelated clutter, known as the clutter problem. The method employs the reparameterization trick to move the gradient operator inside the expectation and relies on the assumption that, because the likelihood factorizes over the observed data, the variational distribution is generally more compactly supported than the Gaussian distribution in the likelihood factors. This allows efficient local approximation of the individual likelihood factors, which leads to an analytical solution for the integral defining the gradient expectation. We integrate the proposed gradient approximation as the expectation step in an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm for maximizing ELBO and test against classical deterministic approaches in Bayesian inference, such as the Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation and Mean-Field Variational Inference. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy and rate of convergence together with linear computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian few-shot classification has been a focal point in the field of few-shot learning. This paper seamlessly integrates mirror descent-based variational inference into Gaussian process-based few-shot classification, addressing the challenge of non-conjugate inference. By leveraging non-Euclidean geometry, mirror descent achieves accelerated convergence by providing the steepest descent direction along the corresponding manifold. It also exhibits the parameterization invariance property concerning the variational distribution. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification accuracy, improved uncertainty quantification, and faster convergence compared to baseline models. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameters and components. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/keanson/MD-BSFC.</description>
