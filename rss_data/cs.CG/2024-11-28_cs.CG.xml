      <title>Visual Complexity of Point Set Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the visual complexity of animated transitions between point sets. Although there exist many metrics for point set similarity, these metrics are not adequate for this purpose, as they typically treat each point separately. Instead, we propose to look at translations of entire subsets/groups of points to measure the visual complexity of a transition between two point sets. Specifically, given two labeled point sets A and B in R^d, the goal is to compute the cheapest transformation that maps all points in A to their corresponding point in B, where the translation of a group of points counts as a single operation in terms of complexity. In this paper we identify several problem dimensions involving group translations that may be relevant to various applications, and study the algorithmic complexity of the resulting problems. Specifically, we consider different restrictions on the groups that can be translated, and different optimization functions. For most of the resulting problem variants we are able to provide polynomial time algorithms, or establish that they are NP-hard. For the remaining open problems we either provide an approximation algorithm or establish the NP-hardness of a restricted version of the problem. Furthermore, our problem classification can easily be extended with additional problem dimensions giving rise to new problem variants that can be studied in future work.</description>

      <title>A fractional Helly theorem for set systems with slowly growing homological shatter function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameters of the convexity spaces associated with families of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where every intersection between $t$ sets of the family has its Betti numbers bounded from above by a function of $t$. Although the Radon number of such families may not be bounded, we show that these families satisfy a fractional Helly theorem. To achieve this, we introduce graded analogues of the Radon and Helly numbers. This generalizes previously known fractional Helly theorems.</description>
