      <title>Improved Image Reconstruction and Diffusion Parameter Estimation Using a Temporal Convolutional Network Model of Gradient Trajectory Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality. Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks. Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.</description>

      <title>XDoppler axial velocity estimation using row-column arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate volumetric velocity estimation in ultrasound imaging is crucial for applications in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Traditional ultrasound systems, while effective in two-dimensional imaging, face significant challenges in achieving 3D imaging due to hardware and computational demands. Row-column addressed (RCA) ultrasound probes present a promising alternative, reducing hardware complexity, thus contributing to bridge the gap between research and clinical systems. Yet, this usually comes at the cost of lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced sensitivity and stronger sidelobes compared to 3D matrices, even though recent methods have tried to tackle the later issue. In this study, we introduce a method to use the phase of the signals acquired by rows and columns of RCA arrays to compute a new velocity estimator based on cross correlation of orthogonal apertures, extending the XDoppler scheme initially introduced for power Doppler imaging to the estimation of velocities. Our results indicate that XDoppler estimator can measure faithfully axial velocities (RMSE=9.21%, R2=0.88) and outperforms the traditional phase shift autocorrelator with a theoretical Nyquist velocity twice higher. Moreover, the in vitro data indicate a better sensitivity to flow velocities below 10mm/s and a lower bias for flow rate estimation (-0.17mL/min as opposed to -9.33mL/min for reference method). In vivo data acquired on a carotid artery confirm the reduced sensitivity to aliasing effects and show that this new technique can dynamically follow blood velocity evolutions linked to arterial pulsatility. This suggests that this new estimator could be of use for improved volumetric blood velocity imaging with a RCA probe.</description>

      <title>Redefining spectral unmixing for in-vivo brain tissue analysis from hyperspectral imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology for extracting molecular tumor biomarkers from hyperspectral imaging (HSI), an emerging technology for intraoperative tissue assessment. To achieve this, we employ spectral unmixing, allowing to decompose the spectral signals recorded by the HSI camera into their constituent molecular components. Traditional unmixing approaches are based on physical models that establish a relationship between tissue molecules and the recorded spectra. However, these methods commonly assume a linear relationship between the spectra and molecular content, which does not capture the whole complexity of light-matter interaction. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel unmixing procedure that allows to take into account non-linear optical effects while preserving the computational benefits of linear spectral unmixing. We validate our methodology on an in-vivo brain tissue HSI dataset and demonstrate that the extracted molecular information leads to superior classification performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling in Wavelet Coefficient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attenuation correction (AC) is necessary for accurate activity quantification in positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional reconstruction methods typically rely on attenuation maps derived from a co-registered computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, this additional scan may complicate the imaging workflow, introduce misalignment artifacts and increase radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation (JRAA) approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary anatomical imaging by relying solely on emission data. This framework combines wavelet diffusion model (WDM) and diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) to reconstruct fully three-dimensional (3-D) data. Experimental results show our method outperforms maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) and MLAA with UNet-based post processing, and yields high-quality noise-free reconstructions across various count settings when time-of-flight (TOF) information is available. It is also able to reconstruct non-TOF data, although the reconstruction quality significantly degrades in low-count (LC) conditions, limiting its practical effectiveness in such settings. This approach represents a step towards stand-alone PET imaging by reducing the dependence on anatomical modalities while maintaining quantification accuracy, even in low-count scenarios when TOF information is available.</description>
