      <title>Validation of Theoretical Estimation Methods and Maximum Value Distribution Calculation for Parametric Roll Amplitude in Long-Crested Irregular Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric rolling is a parametric excitation phenomenon caused by GM variation in waves. There are a lot of studies of the estimation the conditions, the occurrence, and the amplitude of parametric rolling. On the other hand, there are relatively few cases in which theoretical methods for estimating parametric roll amplitudes in irregular waves have been validated in tank tests. The primary objective of this study is to validate theoretical estimation methods for the parametric roll amplitude in irregular waves and improve their accuracy. First, the probability density functions (PDF) of the parametric roll amplitude obtained from the model ship motion experiment in irregular waves are compared with that obtained from theoretical estimation methods. Second, the method to improve the accuracy of estimation of the roll restoring variation in irregular waves is suggested. Third, the method to estimate the distribution of the maximum amplitude of parametric rolling in irregular waves. As a result, the PDFs of the roll amplitude obtained from the experiments differ from the results of theoretical estimation. After that, by correcting GM variation, the results of theoretical estimation are closer to the experimental results. Moreover, by the theoretical estimation method using the moment equation, the qualitative estimation for the PDF of the maximum roll amplitude is succeeded.</description>

      <title>Manipulating liquid-liquid phase separation using patterned flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise control of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is the key to developing cutting-edge technologies that benefit diverse disciplines. Fluid flow was found to be capable of controlling the structure and effective temperature of LLPS, but the extent and precision of control were less than optimal. In this article, we propose that patterned flow can be employed as a generic tool to manipulate LLPS effectively. By combining theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that flows with tailor-made structures can become functional, allowing us to control diverse aspects of LLPS. Typical examples include the capture and pinning of droplets, fine-tuning of droplet sizes, forced assembly of periodic droplet arrays, and the remodeling of the kinetics and structure of phase separation. These manipulations are grounded on the redistribution of chemical potential by the structured flow. Our results not only can lead to potential LLPS-based technologies, but also highlight the rich behavior of LLPS introduced by the patterned flow.</description>

      <title>Investigation of injector-coupled combustion dynamics in a methane-oxygen combustor using large eddy simulation and dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses a reactive flow large eddy simulation (LES) and decomposition techniques to study combustion instabilities in a methane-oxygen combustor. This work examines two case scenarios to elucidate the significance of injector-chamber frequency coupling as the cause of thermo-acoustic instability. Initial investigation in a well-known benchmark case of the continuously variable resonance combustor (CVRC) reports the potential instability mechanisms and the role of injector-chamber frequency coupling in thermo-acoustic instability. Subsequently, the multi-element rocket combustor case study identifies the critical resonant modes and highlights potential frequency coupling between the injector and the chamber region. The interplay between longitudinal pressure oscillations in the oxidizer post and transverse pressure waves in the chamber is responsible for the enhanced pressure dynamics in the combustor. The present work uses the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique to reveal the evolution of acoustic modes in injector and chamber for CVRC and multi-element combustor. The dominant pressure mode forms found by DMD analysis also showcase the role of injector-chamber frequency coupling in amplified combustion dynamics. The results demonstrate how the predominant cause of combustion instability in rocket combustors can be effectively determined using the high-fidelity LES framework in conjunction with the modal decomposition technique.</description>

      <title>Towards High Resolution Real-Time Optical Flow Particle Image Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is the most commonly used optical technique for measuring 2D velocity fields. However, improving the spatial resolution of instantaneous velocity fields and having access to the velocity field in real time remains a challenge. Optical Flow veolcimetry makes it possible to meet these challenges. In this study, we show that it is possible to access dense velocity fields (1 vector per pixel) in real-time using an appropriate seeding concentration adapted to optical flow algorithms and no longer to cross-correlation PIV algorithms. The influence of concentration on the quality of velocity fields is demonstrated using synthetic images generated for a Rankine vortex. We thus demonstrate that it is possible to precisely measure small vortices using optical flow provided that the seeding is suitable. The notion of "Active Pixels" is also introduced in order to define a seeding optimization criterion adapted to experimental measurements. This criterion is finally successfully applied to the flow downstream of a cylinder leading to a spatial resolution down to one vector per pixel.</description>

      <title>Optimization study of a Z-type airflow cooling system of a lithium-ion battery pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study aims to optimize the structural design of a Z-type flow lithium-ion battery pack with a forced air-cooling system (FACS) known as BTMS (Battery Thermal Management System). The main goal is to minimize Tmax (maximum temperature) and \delta Tmax (maximum temperature difference) while ensuring an even airflow distribution within the battery module. The present study thoroughly investigates critical factors such as the inlet air velocity, tapered inlet manifold, and the number of secondary outlets to evaluate their impact on thermal performance and airflow uniformity within the battery module. Increasing the inlet air velocity from 3 to 4.5 m/s significantly improves the thermal cooling performance of the BTMS, resulting in a decrease of 4.57 {\deg}C (10.05%) in Tmax and 0.29 {\deg}C (9.79%) in \delta Tmax compared to the original 3 m/s velocity. Further, the study assesses the significance of a tapered inlet manifold as a critical factor, revealing its substantial impact on cooling performance and temperature reductions in battery cells 3-9. It also facilitates a more uniform airflow distribution, decreasing the velocity difference between channel 9 and channel 1 from 3.32 m/s to 2.50 m/s. Incorporating 7 secondary outlets significantly improves the heat dissipation ability of the BTMS, resulting in a decrease of 0.894 {\deg}C (2.18%) in Tmax and 2.23 {\deg}C (72.84%) in \delta Tmax compared to the configuration with 0 secondary outlets. By optimizing these parameters, the aim is to enhance BTMS's capabilities, improving LIB packs' performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Novel Pressure-Equilibrium and Kinetic-Energy Preserving fluxes for compressible flows based on the harmonic mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing physically-consistent numerical methods is an important step towards attaining robust and accurate numerical simulations. When addressing compressible flows, in addition to preserving kinetic energy at a discrete level, as done in the incompressible case, additional properties are sought after, such as the ability to preserve the equilibrium of pressure that can be found at contact interfaces. This paper investigates the general conditions of the spatial numerical discretizations to achieve the pressure equilibrium preserving property (PEP). Schemes from the literature are analyzed in this respect, and procedures to impart the PEP property to existing discretizations are proposed. Additionally, new PEP numerical schemes are introduced through minor modifications of classical ones. Numerical tests confirmed the theory hereby presented and showed that the modifications, beyond the enforcement of the PEP property, have a generally positive impact on the performances of the original schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the application of Multigrid Neural Operator (MgNO), a neural operator architecture inspired by multigrid methods, in the simulation for multiphase flow within porous media. The architecture is adjusted to manage a variety of crucial factors, such as permeability and porosity heterogeneity. The study extendes MgNO to time-dependent porous media flow problems and validate its accuracy in predicting essential aspects of multiphase flows. Furthermore, the research provides a detailed comparison between MgNO and Fourier Neural Opeartor (FNO), which is one of the most popular neural operator methods, on their performance regarding prediction error accumulation over time. This aspect provides valuable insights into the models' long-term predictive stability and reliability. The study demonstrates MgNO's capability to effectively simulate multiphase flow problems, offering considerable time savings compared to traditional simulation methods, marking an advancement in integrating data-driven methodologies in geoscience applications.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient queue-based algorithm for simulating volume-controlled drainage under the influence of gravity on volumetric images of porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating non-wetting fluid invasion in volumetric images of porous materials is of broad interest in applications as diverse as electrochemical devices and CO2 sequestration. Among available methods, image-based algorithms offer much lower computational cost compared to direct numerical simulations. Recent work has extended image-based method to incorporate more physics such as gravity and volume-controlled invasion. The present work combines these two developments to develop an image-based invasion percolation algorithm that incorporates the effect of gravity. Additionally, the presented algorithm was developed using a priority queue algorithm to drastically reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The priority queue-based method was validated against previous image-based methods both with and without the effect of gravity, showing identical results. It was also shown that the new method provides a speedup of 20X over the previous image-based methods. Finally, comparison with experimental results at three Bond numbers showed that the model can predict the real invasion process with a high accuracy with and without gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Rayleigh-Taylor instability in van der Waals fluid: the influence of compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early studies on Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) primarily relied on the Navier-Stokes (NS) model. As research progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that the kinetic information that the NS model failed to capture is of great value for identifying and even controlling the RTI process; simultaneously, the lack of analysis techniques for complex physical fields results in a significant waste of data information. In addition, early RTI studies mainly focused on the incompressible case and the weakly compressible case. In the case of strong compressibility, the density of the fluid from the upper layer (originally heavy fluid) may become smaller than that of the surrounding (originally light) fluid, thus invalidating the early method of distinguishing light and heavy fluids based on density. In this paper, tracer particles are incorporated into a single-fluid discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) model that considers the van der Waals potential. By using tracer particles to label the matter-particle sources, a careful study of the matter-mixing and energy-mixing processes of the RTI evolution is realized in the single-fluid framework. The effects of compressibility on the evolution of RTI are examined mainly through the analysis of bubble and spike velocities, the ratio of area occupied by heavy fluid, and various entropy generation rates of the system. It is demonstrated that: (1) compressibility has a suppressive effect on the spike velocity, and this suppressive impact diminishes as the Atwood number ($At$) increases. The influence of compressibility on bubble velocity shows a staged behavior with increasing $At$. (2) The impact of compressibility on the entropy production rate associated with the heat flow (${{\dot{S}}_{NOEF}}$) is related to the stages of RTI evolution.</description>
