      <title>Gravitational Compton scattering at zero and finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian formulation of Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory is considered. GEM is a gravitational theory constructed based on the similarities between gravity and electromagnetism. In this framework, we investigate gravitational Compton scattering by calculating its cross section at both zero and finite temperatures. Thermal effects are introduced via the Thermo Field Dynamics formalism. Some comparisons between GEM theory and QED have been developed. The limits of high temperature have been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analog gravity setups.</description>

      <title>Zooming into the horizon region of black hole-type objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal prediction of quantum gravity is that the dynamics of general relativity is augmented by interactions that are of higher order in the spacetime curvature. Numerical explorations indicate that such terms may have a drastic impact on black hole-type solutions by modifying the geometry close to the would-be event horizon in a substantial way. In this work, we perform the first systematic investigation of this blow-up mechanism within general relativity supplemented by quadratic gravity terms, the Goroff-Sagnotti counterterm, the combination of the two, and Einstein-Cubic Gravity. By studying linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild solution close to the Schwarzschild radius, we discover the following picture: the higher-derivative terms giving rise to extra degrees of freedom play a distinguished role. Once couplings associated with these terms enter the solution in the asymptotically flat region, a blow-up mechanism removes the event horizon and one deals with either a naked singularity or a wormhole. We believe that this finding is highly relevant when constraining the coefficients appearing in the Wilsonian description of gravity by observations.</description>

      <title>Dyonic black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis and shadow bound of black holes surrounded by a dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a black hole (BH) immersed in a dark matter halo (DMH), showing that the BH could not be in thermal equilibrium with the DMH in any regions outside the event horizon. This means that the thermodynamic influence of the environment (DMH) is relatively small on the BH and it does not alter the nature of BH with negative heat capacity. The Newtonian ($1/a_0$) approximation gives us a correct thermodynamic description for the BH surrounded by DMH because the first law of thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied. We use the Newtonian Helmholtz free energy to show that there is no phase transition to other BH with positive heat capacity surrounded by a DMH. We investigate the shadow bound of favored region for the BH immersed in the DMH by introducing three critical impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Extra-Dimensional de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Cosmology for a stiff matter, $p = \rho$, anisotropic n-dimensional Universe. One begins by considering a Gaussian wave function for the Universe, which depends on the momenta parameters $q_1$ and $q_2$ , in addition to the dispersion parameters $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. Our solutions show that the extra dimensions are stabilized through a dynamical compactification mechanism within the quantum cosmology framework. In this case, we find two distinct configurations for the dynamics of the extra dimensions. The first configuration features larger extra dimensions at the bounce, which subsequently undergo compactification to a smaller size. In contrast, the second configuration exhibits a smaller extra dimension at the bounce, evolving toward a larger, finite, and stabilized value. We also address the particular five-dimensional case where the Wheeler-DeWitt equation degenerates.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes, Grebody Factors, and Hawking Radiation Sparsity of Black Holes Influenced by a Global Monopole Charge in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity is an intriguing model incorporating local Lorentz violation, and black hole (BH) solutions are known to exist. In this study, we investigate some crucial aspects of BHs endowed with a global monopole charge in the self-interacting KR field. Specifically, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations; derive rigorous bounds for the greybody factors (GBFs); and examine the sparsity of Hawking radiation. The effects of the model parameters $\ell$ (Lorentz-violating parameter in KR gravity) and $\eta$ (monopole charge) on these phenomena are elaborated. First, QNMs are evaluated with high precision using the 13\textsuperscript{th}-order Pad\'{e}-averaged WKB method and cross-examined via time-domain analyses within an acceptable parameter space. The results show that the estimated QNMs are more sensitive to $\ell$; however, both model parameters influence the frequency spectra. The derived bounds on the GBFs aid in further constraining the parameter space. It is shown that $\ell$ and $\eta$ have a similar effect on the greybody bounds. Furthermore, positive and negative values of $\ell$ have opposing effects in that the bounds are reversed for the two cases. The analyses of the Hawking radiation sparsity highlight the effect of $\ell$, and two scenarios are noted: either the radiation emitted is less sparse than Hawking radiation, or it is more sparse during the evaporation phase. Thus, this work presents a comprehensive account of BHs in KR gravity with a global monopole charge.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal dumb holes and some aspects of the Hawking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel non-relativistic fluid analogue models, that is dumb hole models, for extremal and near-extremal black holes. Further we study the back-reaction effects of analogue Hawking radiation emitted from these dumb holes. We discuss and quantify the reduction in the background fluid velocity caused by radiation of Hawking phonons. In doing so, we speculate on the existence of an emergent Hawking force which leads to the reduction in the background fluid velocity and which is produced as a consequence of phonon emission. In addition to the analogue gravity literature, our results might be of relevance to black hole pedagogy.</description>

      <title>Regular Schwarzschild black holes and cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regular Schwarzschild black holes in General Relativity as an alternative to the singular counterpart. We analyze two types of solutions which are completely parameterised by the ADM mass alone. We find that both families of regular solutions contain a de Sitter condensate at the core and admit (quasi) extremal black hole configurations in which the two horizons are arbitrarily close. Cosmological models based on these regular configurations are also analyzed, finding that they describe non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs universes free of singularities.</description>

      <title>Effect of kick velocity on gravitational wave detection of binary black holes with space- and ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs), asymmetric gravitational wave (GW) emission imparts a kick velocity to the remnant black hole, affecting observed waveforms and parameter estimation. In this study, we investigate the impact of this effect on GW observations using space- and ground-based detectors. By applying Lorentz transformations, we analyze waveform modifications due to kick velocities. For space-based detectors, nearly 50% of detected signals require corrections, while for ground-based detectors, this fraction is below one-third. For Q3d population model, space-based detectors could observe kick effects in over 60% of massive BBH mergers, while in pop3 model, this fraction could drop to 3$\sim$4%. Third-generation ground-based detectors may detect kick effects in up to 16% of stellar-mass BBH mergers. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating kick velocity effects into waveform modeling, enhancing GW signal interpretation and our understanding of BBH dynamics and astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Misner-Sharp Energy and P-V Criticality in Quasi-Topological Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented a sound foundation of thermodynamics for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe from the first principle in ground-breaking work [Hu et al., JHEP12 (2022) 168]. Based on such an approach, we explore the thermodynamics of cosmology in quasi-topology gravity. Starting from the unified first law, we first obtain the well-defined Misner-Sharp energy in quasi-topology cosmology. We demonstrate that the Misner-Sharp energy is equal to $\rho V$ inside the apparent horizon. Further, the unified first law requires extra terms for generalized force and conjugate generalized position, which are identified as thermodynamic pressure and thermodynamic volume, respectively. Hence we naturally derive the equation of state of the FRW universe in quasi-topology gravity, and show that it undergoes $P$-$V$ phase transitions. We calculate the critical exponents for the phase transition, which may be beneficial to probe the micro theory of quasi-topology gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Schwarzschild-Melvin solution within Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories to include non-null scalar charges, while remaining embedded in a magnetic or electric field \`a la Melvin. We then use this general solution to obtain the solution in the specific case of Entangled Relativity after a conformal transformation. This notably enables us to verify that the analytical solution used in [Arruga &amp; Minazzoli 2021] in order to represent compact objects such as neutron stars in Entangled Relativity is indeed a good approximation of the exact solutions of Entangled Relativity when the background field goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell inequalities from Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper [R. Dale. R. Lapiedra, and J. A. Morales-Lladosa, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 023506 (2023)] a cosmic-like Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality was proved for the temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ of the perturbed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), assuming local realism. This inequality can be tested from observational data. In fact, no violation for it has been found from the CMB data provided by the COBE satellite in different sky directions. This is a result which, being negative, is not conclusive in relation to the possible violation of the CHSH inequality in a cosmological context. So, the preceding analysis needs to be extended by using more precise current CMB data, like those provided by WMAP and Planck satellites. This is a task of considerable importance but, technically, much more involved in data treatments. In this work, assuming again local realism behind measurements and observational data, this extension is accomplished. The result is that a sound violation of the CHSH inequality is found, which would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation and the orthodox interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave probe of vector dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal components of massive vector fields generated during inflation constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, with interesting phenomenological implications. During the epoch of radiation domination following inflation, their spectrum exhibits a peak at small scales, whose amplitude and position are governed by the parameters of the dark matter model. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum induced at second order in fluctuations by such a longitudinal vector peak. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum can, in principle, reach significant values at nano-Hertz frequencies or lower. This result suggests a novel gravitational wave probe to test inflationary vector dark matter scenarios, independent from assumptions on the coupling of dark vectors to the Standard Model. Additionally, we derive new analytical formulas for the longitudinal vector transfer functions during radiation domination, offering a valuable tool for characterising the convolution integrals that govern the properties of the induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Impact of merger histories on the timing argument estimate of the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timing argument (TA) aims to find the total mass of the Local Group (LG) from the relative motions of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda Galaxy (M31). However, the classical TA always overestimates the LG mass, presumably because it does not account for the hierarchical scenario and other interactions such as that with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We focus on the impact of the recent major merger at M31 by using three merger models to find the peculiar motion of M31 within the simple two-body and point-mass scenario of TA. We found that the merger correction may affect the TA mass by either plus or minus 10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large uncertainties. If we consider a M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA mass by 10-15% to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as reported in the literature, the TA mass would be found consistent with the LG mass from Hubble-Lemaitre flow. Galaxies are expected to experience about 16 major mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers have similar impact on the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass would be $0.85^{+0.65}_{-0.37}$ and such a TA mass is consistent with all the LG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with the findings using LG analogues in the cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited by the hierarchical scenario, since it not possible to track the progenitors of both MW and M31 through so many mergers. We conclude that the MW-M31 dynamical system is far too complex to be modelled as a simple two-body point mass system.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in finite cutoff JT gravity: A study of baby universes and (Krylov) complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, as an application of the `Complexity = Volume' proposal, we calculate the growth of the interior of a black hole at late times for finite cutoff JT gravity. Due to this integrable, irrelevant deformation, the spectral properties are modified non-trivially. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) length saturates faster than pure JT gravity. We comment on the possible connection between Krylov Complexity and ERB length for deformed theory. Apart from this, we calculate the emission probability of baby universes for the deformed theory and make remarks on its implications for the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. Finally, we compute the correction to the volume of the moduli space due to the non-perturbative change of the spectral curve because of the finite cutoff at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls with bias directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the two-brane model and show that any field is settled on both neighboring branes, thus forming two independent effective fields with different masses. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for a brane populated by observers. The neighboring brane is thus populated by extremely massive fields. The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics.
  It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers.</description>

Abstract: We study the isometry groups of (non-compact) Lorentzian manifolds with well-behaved causal structure, aka causal spacetimes satisfying the ``no observer horizons'' condition. Our main result is that the group of time orientation-preserving isometries acts properly on the spacetime. As corollaries, we obtain the existence of an invariant Cauchy temporal function, and a splitting of the isometry group into a compact subgroup and a subgroup roughly corresponding to time translations. The latter can only be the trivial group, $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>The Starobinsky model of inflation and Renormalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model was born in a cosmological scenario where conformally coupled matter quantum field fluctuations on the vacuum drive a non trivial semiclassical energy momentum tensor quadratic in curvature. The presence of an unstable de Sitter solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations contributed to spread the idea that the early universe could have experienced an inflationary epoch. Effective "$R + R^2$" models of gravity have later gained much attention since their predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements of CMB data and tensor to scalar ratio bounds. In this paper we observe how the Starobinsky model can be well approximated by the asymptotically free quadratic gravity on a part of a renormalization group trajectory (below some high UV scale) which is free from tachyonic instabilities, if a definition of ``physical'' running is employed.</description>

Abstract: We focus on the interaction of a plane gravitational wave with electromagnetic fields and we describe this interaction in the proper detector frame where, thanks to the introduction of Fermi coordinates, it is possible to refer to directly measurable quantities. The presence of a gravitational field can be addressed in terms of an effective electromagnetic medium and, within this framework, we show that the coupling of pre-existing electromagnetic fields with the gravitational field of the wave gives rise to new effective currents. To assess the impact of these effects, we solve Maxwell's equations for some standard configurations of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we construct flux-balance laws for four of the five constants of motion for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, although not in a practical form. However, this result provides a promising path towards deriving the flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

      <title>Throat effects on strong gravitational lensing in Kerr-like wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study strong gravitational lensing by a specific one-parameter extension of Kerr spacetime, a Kerr-like wormhole, characterized by a single parameter specifying the throat's location. We classify the roots of the radial potential derived from the null geodesic equations. We focus on the conditions required for the throat, together with the other roots, to become either a double root or a triple root, potentially leading to the divergence of the deflection angle of the light rays in the strong deflection limit (SDL). In particular, while a logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle is known to occur as the closest distance $r_0$ of an incident light trajectory around a black hole approaches a double root, a stronger power-law (nonlogarithmic) divergence is found as $r_0$ approaches a triple root especially in a wormhole. In addition, the effective potential in terms of the proper distance from the throat is constructed, with which one can see how the light rays can either travel within a single spacetime, where both the source and the observers are located, or pass from the source through the throat into another spacetime where different observers reside. Observational effects, such as relativistic images resulting from the deflection of light by wormholes, are discussed, and they could serve as a unique feature of wormholes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ref. [1], it was claimed that in the spatially flat cosmological case there exists a unique conserved measure (up to normalization) on the $(\phi,\dot{\phi})$ phase space for scalar field with $m^2\phi^2$ potential by finding a unique solution to the differential equation (44) (in Ref. [1]) in the low-energy regime. In Ref. [2], it was also claimed that a unique solution to the same differential equation was found in the high-energy regime and using this solution the authors calculated the expected total number of e-folds of inflation. In this comment, we reanalyze the differential equation (44) and obtain general solutions both in the low-energy and high-energy regime, which can include the solution in Ref. [1] and the solution in Ref. [2] as a special case in the corresponding energy regime. In this way, we find that following the constructions in Ref. [1] there actually exist infinitely many nonequivalent conserved measures for the scalar-field cosmology with $m^2\phi^2$ potential on the $(\phi,\dot{\phi})$ phase space. Moreover, through specific calculations, we also show that different choices of measures can lead to quite different predictions of the expected total number of e-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>The neutrino flavor oscillations in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of neutrino lensing induced by a Damour-Solodukhin wormhole on the neutrino oscillation. We derive and calculate the flavour transition probabilities in the presence of Damour-Solodukhin factor $\Lambda$ as a shift in the massive source to show that the neutrino flavour oscillation is also sensitive not only to the sign of difference between the squared masses but also to the individual mass of neutrinos in both the two-flavour and the three-flavour cases, which is similar to the results for the black holes in the previous works mentioned here. As a consequence of parameter $\Lambda$ within a region, a series of curves of probability function versus the azimuthal angle $\phi$ with definite masses of neutrino can be plotted and their shapes resemble each other in the case of two-flavoured neutrinos and of three-flavoured ones. In view of the probability functions due to the wormhole, we reveal that the contribution of the factor $\Lambda$ is novel. Based on our analytical and numerical discussions on the probability expressions, the difference of the neutrino flavour oscillation arising from the shift in the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ is detectable. It is crucial that the $\Lambda$ as deviation from the black holes can change the shapes of the curves greatly, in the case of three-flavoured neutrinos in particular. The detailed comparisons can be made among our estimations depicted in the figures for neutrino oscillations and the measurements from the detector, which open a new window for judging whether the remote star as lens is black-hole-like wormhole or just a spherically symmetric black hole and further the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ can be estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain generally covariant operator-valued geodesic equations on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M$ as an application of quantum geodesics on the algebra $D(M)$ of differential operators. Geodesic motion arises here as an associativity condition for a certain form of first order differential calculus on this algebra in the presence of curvature. The corresponding Schr\"odinger picture has wavefunctions on spacetime and proper time evolution by the Klein-Gordon operator, with stationary modes precisely solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. As an application, we describe gravatom solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations around a Schwarzschild black hole, i.e. gravitationally bound states which far from the event horizon resemble atomic states with the black hole in the role of the nucleus. The spatial eigenfunctions exhibit probability density banding as for higher orbital modes of an ordinary atom, but of a fractal nature approaching the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study general relativistic quantum mechanics in the case of an FLRW cosmological background. For positive spatial curvature we find a discrete series of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation that can reasonably be called gravitationally bound `cosmological atom' states. For all cases of curvature, these modes, as well as more conventional atomic spatial modes bound by an external potential, extend to solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations viewed as stationary modes of Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics where wavefunctions are over spacetime and evolution is with respect to an external `geodesic time' parameter $s$. For general nonstationary states with fixed spatial eigenvector, the theory reduces to a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time $t$ axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. Its behaviour, and hence the evolution of spatial states, changes critically when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields in the background of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. In particular, we explore the case for Myers-Perry black holes with two arbitrary rotation parameters. Since the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field is separable, we numerically compute the scalar quasinormal modes by using the radial and angular equations. Two methods, the continued fraction method and matrix method, are used in the numerical calculation. We find that all obtained modes have negative imaginary parts and are decaying modes. We also consider the impact of the rotation parameters, scalar field mass $\mu$ and azimuthal numbers on the scalar quasinormal modes. Besides, when the scalar mass $\mu$ becomes relatively large, we also find the long-living scalar modes. Our numerical results also demonstrate the symmetries of the QNMs explicitly.</description>

      <title>Dynamical String Tension Theories with target space scale invariance SSB and restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08875v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string and brane tensions do not have to be put in by hand, they can be dynamically generated, as in the case when we formulate string and brane theories in the modified measure formalism. Then string and brane tensions appears, but as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . It can be seen however that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each string and each brane generates its own tension, which can have a different value for each string or brane. There should be also a considerable effect for the effective gravity theories derived from these theories. We consider new background fields that can couple to these new types of extended objects, one of them, the tension scalar is capable of changing locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equation determines the tension scalar. We also find that the construction of brane world scenarios in the context of these dynamical tension string theories, we discuss avoidance of the Hagedorn temperature possible relaxation of string swampland constraints in dynamical tension string theories, and that the dynamical string theories can bridge between the low and high energy quantum gravity effects, The dynamical modified string theory has target space scale invariance and this target space scale invariance can be restored at the points where the string tension approaches infinity. These models suggest the swampland constraints could be avoided.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new inequality for a nonlinear surface layer integral is proved for minimizers of causal variational principles. This inequality is applied to obtain a new proof of the positive mass theorem with volume constraint. Next, a positive mass theorem without volume constraint is stated and proved by introducing and using the concept of asymptotic alignment. Moreover, a positive quasilocal mass and a synthetic definition of scalar curvature are introduced in the setting of causal variational principles. Our notions and results are illustrated by the explicit examples of causal fermion systems constructed in ultrastatic spacetimes and the Schwarzschild spacetime. In these examples, the correspondence to the ADM mass and similarities to the Brown-York mass are worked out.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Dirac spectrum of general-relativistic hydrogenic ions with anomalous magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om (RWN) spacetime of a point nucleus features a naked singularity for the empirically known nuclear charges $Ze$ and masses $M = A(Z,N)m_{\mathrm{p}}$, where $m_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the proton mass and $A(Z,N)\approx Z+N$ the atomic mass number, with $Z$ the number of protons and $N$ the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The Dirac Hamiltonian for a test electron with mass $m_{\mathrm{e}}$, charge $-e$, and anomalous magnetic moment $\mu_a (\approx - \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{e^3}{m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2})$ in the electrostatic RWN spacetime of such a 'naked point nucleus' is known to be essentially self-adjoint, with a spectrum that consists of the union of the essential spectrum $(-\infty, m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2]\cup[m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2, \infty)$ and a discrete spectrum of infinitely many eigenvalues in the gap $(-m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2,m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2)$, having $m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2$ as accumulation point. In this paper the discrete spectrum is characterized in detail for the first time, for all $Z\leq 45$ and $A$ that cover all known isotopes. The eigenvalues are mapped one-to-one to those of the traditional Dirac Hydrogen spectrum. Numerical evaluations that go beyond $Z=45$ into the realm of not-yet-produced hydrogenic ions are presented, too. A list of challenging open problems concludes this publication.</description>

      <title>Holographic image features of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic image of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity. The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system assists observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that show an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifted, the bright ring gradually transformed into a luminous arc and eventually transitioned into a light point. Simultaneously, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantity on the ring, and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that as the temperature $T$ and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter $q$ increase, the ring radius also increases, while an increase in the chemical potential $u$ leads to a decrease. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of $T$, $u$, and $q$ increase, albeit to varying degrees. Upon comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, it can be observed that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon ring.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Primordial Bounce-Inflation Scenario to Alleviate Cosmological Tensions and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a primordial scenario to alleviate cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension. Based on flat $\Lambda$CDM, the Bounce-Inflation (BI) scenario gives the results that $ H_0 = 68.60^{+0.40}_{-0.45} \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.806 \pm 0.011 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 68.96 \pm 0.38 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.797\pm 0.010 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets. These reduce the cosmological tensions slightly. We also take an extended $\Lambda$CDM model into account, $\Lambda$CDM (BI)+$A_L$, where $ A_L $ is the gravitational lensing amplitude. The results are $ H_0 = 69.38 \pm 0.49 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.014 $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 69.49 \pm 0.45 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.771^{+0.013}_{-0.012} $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets, which reduce the Hubble tension to $\sim 3\sigma $ level and show no $S_8 $ tension. The $A_L \approx 1.1$ is smaller than the result of the inflation scenario with a constraint of \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets. Besides, the spectral index of the bounce-inflation scenario $ n_s $ is about $ 0.98 $, with a trend to the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We study mathematical aspects concerning two site tree-level cosmological correlators with massive internal and external states in a de Sitter universe. We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of an EFT expansion, known as positivity bounds. Their standard derivation relies on the crucial assumption of polynomial boundedness on the growth of scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane, which is a property satisfied by local QFTs, and by weakly coupled string theory in the Regge regime. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness, typical of non-local QFTs where the Froissart-Martin bound is usually not satisfied. Using appropriately modified dispersion relations, we derive new constraints and find regions in the EFT parameter space that do not admit a local UV completion. Furthermore, we show that there exist EFTs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided that the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or larger than the EFT cutoff. Finally, we provide an explicit example of an exponentially bounded amplitude that satisfies partial-wave unitarity and asymptotic causality.</description>

      <title>What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to consider Axion-like particle (ALP) model to investigate the behaviour of space-time in the vicinity of the domain wall, induced by axion-like field. Here we present first-step approximation in our analysis and discuss the applicability of thin-shell approximation.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>

Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>
