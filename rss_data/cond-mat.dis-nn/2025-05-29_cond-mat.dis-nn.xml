      <title>Synaptic shot-noise triggers fast and slow global oscillations in balanced neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural dynamics is determined by the transmission of discrete synaptic pulses (synaptic shot-noise) among neurons. However, the neural responses are usually obtained within the diffusion approximation modeling synaptic inputs as continuous Gaussian noise. Here, we present a rigorous mean-field theory that encompasses synaptic shot-noise for sparse balanced inhibitory neural networks driven by an excitatory drive. Our theory predicts new dynamical regimes, in agreement with numerical simulations, which are not captured by the classical diffusion approximation. Notably, these regimes feature self-sustained global oscillations emerging at low connectivity (in-degree) via either continuous or hysteretic transitions and characterized by irregular neural activity, as expected for balanced dynamics. For sufficiently weak (strong) excitatory drive (inhibitory feedback) the transition line displays a peculiar re-entrant shape revealing the existence of global oscillations at low and high in-degrees, separated by an asynchronous regime at intermediate levels of connectivity. The mechanisms leading to the emergence of these global oscillations are distinct: drift-driven at high connectivity and cluster activation at low connectivity. The frequency of these two kinds of global oscillations can be varied from slow (around 1 Hz) to fast (around 100 Hz), without altering their microscopic and macroscopic features, by adjusting the excitatory drive and the synaptic inhibition strength in a prescribed way. Furthermore, the cluster-activated oscillations at low in-degrees could correspond to the gamma rhythms reported in mammalian cortex and hippocampus and attributed to ensembles of inhibitory neurons sharing few synaptic connections [G. Buzsaki and X.-J. Wang, Annual Review of Neuroscience 35, 203 (2012)].</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22166v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p &lt; 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired Generative AI models via real hardware-based noisy quantum diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Diffusion Models (QDMs) are an emerging paradigm in Generative AI that aims to use quantum properties to improve the performances of their classical counterparts. However, existing algorithms are not easily scalable due to the limitations of near-term quantum devices. Following our previous work on QDMs, here we propose and implement two physics-inspired protocols. In the first, we use the formalism of quantum stochastic walks, showing that a specific interplay of quantum and classical dynamics in the forward process produces statistically more robust models generating sets of MNIST images with lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) than using totally classical dynamics. In the second approach, we realize an algorithm to generate images by exploiting the intrinsic noise of real IBM quantum hardware with only four qubits. Our work could be a starting point to pave the way for new scenarios for large-scale algorithms in quantum Generative AI, where quantum noise is neither mitigated nor corrected, but instead exploited as a useful resource.</description>

      <title>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.</description>

      <title>From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature learning in neural networks is crucial for their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various theoretical approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving directional changes to the kernel. The relationship and respective strengths of these two views have so far remained unresolved. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these two views. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output in the special case of a linear network. However, for linear and non-linear networks, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex presents challenges and raises questions. What are the significant scales--micro, meso, or macroscopic? What are the interactions--pairwise, higher order, or mean-field? And what control parameters are relevant--noisy, dissipative, or emergent?
  We suggest an approach inspired by advances in understanding matter. This involves identifying invariances in neuron ensemble dynamics, searching for order parameters connecting key degrees of freedom and distinguishing macroscopic states, and pinpointing broken symmetries to uncover emergent laws when neurons interact and coordinate.
  Using multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure population-level ensemble Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) balance, differing from the input-level E/I balance of single neurons, to study collective behavior in large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (during wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify pathological broken symmetries that result in states like seizures.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

Abstract: Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>
