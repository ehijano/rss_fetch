      <title>Anomalous properties of spark plasma sintered boron nitride solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is brittle, however, its atomic-scale structural engineering can lead to unprecedented physical properties. Here we report the bulk synthesis of high-density crystalline h-BN solids by using high-temperature spark plasma sintering (SPS) of micron size h-BN powders. In addition to the high mechanical strength and ductile response of such materials, we have obtained anomalous values of dielectric constant beyond theoretical limits, high thermal conductivity, and exceptional neutron radiation shielding capability. Through exhaustive characterizations we reveal that SPS induces non-basal plane crystallinity, twisting of layers, and facilitates inter-grain fusion with a high degree of in-plane alignment across macroscale dimensions, resulting in near-theoretical density and anomalous properties. Our findings highlight the importance of material design, via new approaches such as twisting and interconnections between atomically thin layers, to create novel ceramics with properties that could go beyond their intrinsic theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>GdWN$_3$ is a Nitride Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitride perovskites $AB$N$_3$ are an emerging and highly under-explored class of materials that are of interest due to their intriguing calculated ferroelectric, optoelectronic, and other functional properties. Incorporating novel $A$-site cations is one strategy to tune and expand such properties; for example, Gd$^{3+}$ is compelling due to its large magnetic moment, potentially leading to multiferroic behavior. However, the theoretically predicted ground state of GdWN$_3$ is a non-perovskite monoclinic structure. Here, we experimentally show that GdWN$_3$ crystallizes in a perovskite structure. High-throughput combinatorial sputtering with activated nitrogen is employed to synthesize thin films of Gd$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$N$_{3-y}$ with low oxygen content within the bulk of the films. Ex-situ annealing crystallizes a polycrystalline perovskite phase in a narrow composition window near $x=1$. LeBail fits of synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering data are consistent with a perovskite ground-state structure. New density functional theory calculations that included antiferromagnetic configurations confirm that the ground-state structure of GdWN$_3$ is a distorted $Pnma$ perovskite with antiferromagnetic ordering, in contrast to prior predictions. Initial property measurements find that GdWN$_3$ is paramagnetic down to $T=2$ K with antiferromagnetic correlations and that the absorption onset depends on cation stoichiometry. This work provides an important stepping stone towards the rapid expansion of the emerging family of nitride perovskites and towards our understanding of their potential multiferroic properties.</description>

      <title>First-principles Investigation into the Heterostructures and Moir\'e Bilayers of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), where M represents Mo or W and X is S, Se, or Te, exhibit unique properties when configured into hetero- and homo-bilayers with diverse stacking arrangements. This study emphasizes the impact of "magic angles" in twisted homobilayers that lead to transformative Moir\'e patterns, crucial for manipulating material properties. Our computational analysis of heterostructures covered 30 combinations from six MX$_2$ types, revealing that both the materials' choice and stacking significantly affect stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60$^{\circ}$ twist demonstrates a direct E$_g$, underscoring its potential in novel applications. In homobilayers, both fully relaxed and low-strain scenarios were examined across various stackings and twists. We found that optimal bilayers' E$_g$ is highly dependent on stacking alignment. Particularly, 1T-MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ can exhibit direct or indirect E$_g$ under specific twisted conditions, with 1T-MoS$_2$ showing a capability to transition between semiconductor and conductor states. Specific "magic angles" at 17.9$^{\circ}$ and 42.1$^{\circ}$ in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers form symmetrical Moir\'e patterns, enabling fine-tuning of E$_g$ through angle adjustments and influencing electronic band flatness. Compared to monolayers, these TMDC bilayers display enhanced stability, which can be strategically adjusted. The use of controlled twisted angles in these bilayers emerges as a powerful tool in materials engineering, offering precise control over various electronic properties.</description>

      <title>AB-Type Dual-Phase High-Entropy Alloys as Negative Electrode of Ni-MH Batteries: Impact of Interphases on Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) and their corresponding high-entropy hydrides are new potential candidates for negative electrode materials of nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. This study investigates the cyclic electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of two AB-type HEAs (A: hydride-forming elements, B: non-hydride-forming elements) in Ni-MH batteries. TiV2ZrCrMnFeNi with a dual-phase structure shows a fast activation and a low charge transfer impedance with a discharge capacity of 150 mAhg-1, while TiV1.5Zr1.5CrMnFeNi with a single phase shows a slow activation and a capacity of only 60 mAhg-1. The better electrochemical performance of TiV2ZrCrMnFeNi was attributed to its higher vanadium/zirconium ratio and abundant interphase boundaries, which act as hydrogen paths and heterogeneous hydride nucleation sites. These results suggest the high potential of dual-phase HEAs as new active electrode materials for Ni-MH batteries.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e polar vortex, flat bands and Lieb lattice in twisted bilayer BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in material fabrication techniques and growth methods have opened up a new chapter for twistronics, in the form of twisted freestanding three-dimensional material membranes. Through first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we investigate the crystal and electronic structures of twisted bilayer BaTiO$_3$. Our findings reveal that large stacking fault energy leads to chiral in-plane vortex pattern that was recently observed in experiments. Moreover, we also found non-zero out-of-plane local dipole moments, indicating that the strong interlayer interaction might offer promising strategy to stabilize ferroelectric order in the two-dimensional limit. Remarkably, the vortex pattern in the twisted BaTiO$_3$ bilayer support localized electronic states with quasi-flat bands, associated with the interlayer hybridization of oxygen $p_z$ orbitals. We found that the associated band width reaches a minimum at $\sim$19$^{\circ}$ twisting, configuring the largest magic angle in moir\'e systems reported so far. Further, the moir\'e vortex pattern bears a striking resemblance to two interpenetrating Lieb lattices and corresponding tight-binding model provides a comprehensive description of the evolution the moir\'e bands with twist angle and reveals the topological nature of these states.</description>

      <title>Recycling failed photoelectrons via tertiary photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key insight of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect is that a minimum energy is required for photoexcited electrons to escape from a material. For the past century it has been assumed that photoexcited electrons of lower energies make no contribution to the photoemission spectrum. Here we demonstrate the conceptual possibility that the energy of these 'failed' photoelectrons-primary or secondary-can be partially recycled to generate new 'tertiary' electrons of energy sufficient to escape. Such a 'recycling' step goes beyond the traditional three steps of the photoemission process (excitation, transport, and escape), and, as we illustrate, it can be realized through a novel Auger mechanism that involves three distinct minority electronic states in the material. We develop a phenomenological three-band model to treat this mechanism within a revised four-step framework for photoemission, which contains robust features of linewidth narrowing and population inversion under strong excitation, reminiscent of the lasing phenomena. We show that the conditions for this recycling mechanism are likely satisfied in many quantum materials with multiple flat bands properly located away from the Fermi level, and elaborate on the representative case of SrTiO3 among other promising candidates. We further discuss how this mechanism can explain the recent observation of anomalous intense coherent photoemission from a SrTiO3 surface, and predict its manifestations in related experiments, including the 'forbidden' case of photoemission with photon energies lower than the work function. Our study calls for paradigm shifts across a range of fundamental and applied research fields, especially in the areas of photoemission, photocathodes, and flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Detecting the spread of valence band Wannier functions by optical sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of valence band Wannier functions in semiconductors and insulators is a characteristic property that gives a rough estimation of how insulating is the material. We elaborate that the gauge-invariant part of the spread can be extracted experimentally from optical conductivity and absorbance, owing to their equivalence to the quantum metric of the valence band states integrated over momentum. Because the quantum metric enters the matrix element of optical conductivity, the spread of valence band Wannier functions in the gapped 3D materials can be obtained from the frequency-integration of the imaginary part of the dielectric function. We demonstrate this practically for typical semiconductors like Si and Ge, and for topological insulators like Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. In 2D materials, the spread of Wannier functions in the valence bands can be obtained from the absorbance divided by frequency and then integrated over frequency. Applying this method to graphene reveals a finite spread caused by intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, which may be detected by absorbance in the microwave range. The absorbance of twisted bilayer graphene in the millimeter wave range can be used to detect the formation of the flat bands and quantify their quantum metric. Finally, we apply our method to hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides MX$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) and demonstrate how other effects like substrate, excitons, and higher energy bands can affect the spread of Wannier function.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological phases and skin effects in kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has added new ingredients to topological physics, leading to the rising frontier of non-Hermitian topological phases. In this study, we investigate Chern insulator phases emerging from non-Hermitian kagome models with non-reciprocal and pure imaginary next-nearest neighbor hoppings. In the presence or absence of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, hybrid topological-skin effects are explored through the identification of distinct corner skin modes in different energy regions within two band gaps. By employing the dynamical analysis, the underlying physics is revealed from the non-Hermitian skin effects associated with the chiral edge states, leading to diverse non-Hermitian bulk-boundary responses. The simplicity of these kagome models and their rich emergent topological phenomena suggest that they are appealing candidates for studying non-Hermitian topological phases. We further discuss the possible realizations of these models in non-Hermitian metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Atomic Jumps Induce Grain Boundary Stagnation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystalline materials can be impeded by grain boundary (GB) stagnation. Using atomistic simulations, we unveil a novel mechanism in this study that explains GB stagnation in the absence of solutes and other impurities: disruptive atomic jumps in the GB area. These disruptive atomic jumps can be activated by both high driving forces and high temperatures, with even jumps of a few atoms capable of causing the stagnation of an entire GB. This mechanism also explains the non-Arrhenius behavior observed in some GBs. Additionally, a large model size could increase the rate of disruptive atomic jumps, and a clear transition in thermal behavior is observed with the increase of the GB size in GBs exhibiting clear thermally activated stagnation. Our further investigation shows that the disruptive atoms involved in these jumps do not differ from other GB atoms in terms of atomic energy, volume, density, local entropy, or Voronoi tessellation, and no "jam transition" was observed in the energy barrier spectra. This fact makes those disruptive jumps challenging to detect. To address this issue, we propose a displacement vector analysis method that effectively identifies these subtle disruptive jumps.</description>

      <title>P-doping improves the stability of BP-N at ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black phosphorus nitrogen (BP-N) is an attractive high-energy density material. However, high pressure synthesized BP-N will decompose at low pressure and cannot exist under ambient conditions. Finding a method to stabilize it at atmospheric pressure is of great significance for its practical applications. However, unlike cg-N, LP-N, and HLP-N, it is not in ground state on the enthalpy-pressure curve under all pressure, and it exhibits imaginary frequencies in its phonon spectrum under 0 GPa. In our study, we have discovered that P doping can effectively reduce the synthesis pressure of BP-N and maintain its stability under atmospheric conditions. Homogeneous doping within the layers helps maintain the static structural stability of layer, while specific interlayer doping enhances its dynamic stability by eliminating interlayer slipping. the calculated energy density of 12.5% doping is 7.49 kJ/g, which is twice the energy density of TNT. This highlights the significance of doping as an effective approach to achieve stable and high-performance BP-N.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Anisotropic Polarization Dynamics of Electronic Ferroelectrics LuFe2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond time-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements were performed at room temperature on a single crystal of LuFe2O4, which has recently attracted attention as an electronic ferroelectric material in which polarization occurs due to the real-space arrangement of Fe2+ and Fe3+. We irradiated the crystal with 800 nm laser pulses, traced the subsequent SHG changes, and observed anisotropic polarization dynamics: immediately after photoexcitation, the in-plane (ab-plane) component of the SHG greatly reduced, while the inter-plane (c-axis) SHG increased. This means that a hidden photoexcited state, in which the in-plane charge ordering is broken but the polarization along c-axis direction enhanced, has been created by photoexcitation, indicating that the electronic ferroelectricity can be controlled on a femtosecond scale.</description>

      <title>Designing a polymerized phenalenyl tessellation molecule to realize a super-honeycomb antiferromagnetic S = 3/2 spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multiply hydrogenated polymer of phenalenyl tessellation molecules (PTMs) where spatially overlapping zero modes appear, three parallelly spin-aligned electron spins per PTM are generated by the direct exchange interaction of the strongly correlated electron system, which we used to facilitate the molecular design of a two-dimensional (2D) S = 3/2 Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice. Density functional theory with the Wannierization method simulations of the electronic structure suggested that an array of nonbonding molecular orbitals (an array of zero modes) appears in the hydrogenated nanographene structure. Our evaluation of the onsite interaction strength indicated that each zero mode becomes half-filled with a spin-active electron by the electron correlation effect. The low-energy subspace of the obtained zero mode-tight-binding model implies the appearance of a 2D antiferromagnetic S = 3/2 Heisenberg system with the entangled quantum spin ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of crystalline pentazolates marks a major advance in polynitrogen science and raises prospects of making the long-touted potent propellant N$_5$$^{+}$N$_5$$^{-}$ salt. However, despite the synthesis of cyclo-N$_5$$^{-}$ anion in pentazolates, counter cation cyclo-N$_5$$^{+}$ remains elusive due to the strong oxidizing power of pentazole ion; moreover, pure N$_5$$^{+}$N$_5$$^{-}$ salt is known to be unstable. Here, we devise a new strategy for making rare cyclo-N$_5$$^{+}$ cation and assembling the long-sought N$_5$$^{+}$N$_5$$^{-}$ salt in tailored ionic compounds, wherein the negative/positive host ions act as oxidizing/reducing agents to form cyclo-N$_5$$^{+}$/N$_5$$^{-}$ species. This strategy is implemented via an advanced computational crystal structure search, which identifies XN$_5$N$_5$F (X = Li, Na, K) compounds that stabilize at high pressures and remain viable at ambient pressure-temperature conditions based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. This finding opens an avenue for creating and stabilizing N$_5$$^{+}$N$_5$$^{-}$ salt assembly in ionic compounds, where cyclo-N$_5$ species are oxidized/reduced via co-matching with host ions of high/low electronegativity. The present results demonstrate novel polynitrogen chemistry, and these findings offer new insights and prospects in the design and synthesis of diverse chemical species that exhibit unusual charge states, bonding structures, and superior functionality.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Manipulation of Band Gap Dynamics via Electron-Phonon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is a ubiquitous interaction in condensed systems and plays a vital role in shaping the electronic properties of materials. Yet, achieving coherent manipulation of electron-phonon coupling has posed a considerable challenge. Here, employing time-resolved high-harmonic generation (tr-HHG) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of bandgap dynamics in a BaF2 crystal by precisely controlling the EPC using ultrashort light pulses. The tr-HHG spectrum perturbed by a triply degenerate phonon mode T2g, exhibits simultaneously a remarkable two-dimensional (2D) sensitivity, namely intensity domain in addition to the previously reported energy domain. The dynamic compression and enhancement of the harmonics in the intensity domain showed a {\pi}/2 phase shift compared to the manifestation of shifts of the harmonics in the energy domain, an astounding example of a physical phenomenon being observed simultaneously in two different perspectives. To complement our experimental observations, we employed a quantum model that incorporates the EPC, successfully reproducing the results. In addition, we demonstrated complete control over the EPC strength and initial phase of the coherent phonon oscillations by varying the incident electric field polarization over crystal orientation. Our findings lay a foundation for future investigations aiming to harness and exploit the remarkable potential of EPC in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing atomic ordering, magnetic and transport properties of Mn2VGa Heusler alloy thin films toward negatively spin-polarized charge injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials with negative spin polarization have attracted attention for their potential to increase the design freedom of spintronic devices. This study investigated the effects of off-stoichiometry on the atomic ordering, microstructure, and magneto-transport properties in Mn2+xV1-xGa (x = -0.2, 0, +0.2, +0.4) Heusler alloy films, which are predicted to have large negative spin polarization derived from a pseudo band gap in the majority spin channel. The Mn2+xV1-xGa films epitaxially grown on MgO(001) substrates exhibits variations of B2 and L21 order with the Mn concentration. A high-quality L21 ordered film was achieved in the Mn-rich composition (x = +0.2) with B2 and L21 order parameters of 0.97 and 0.86, respectively, and a saturation magnetization of 1.4 {\mu}B/f.u, which agrees the Slater-Pauling rule. Scanning transmission electron microscopy observations showed that B2 and L21 phases coexist in Mn-poor and stoichiometric films, while the L21 phase is dominant in the Mn-rich film with small amounts of Mn-V and Mn-Ga disorders, as revealed by laboratory and anomalous X-ray diffraction. Combined first-principles calculations and anisotropic magnetoresistance analysis confirm that the addition of excess Mn preserves the high spin polarization by suppressing the formation of detrimental antisites of V atoms occupying Mn sites. Therefore, the Mn-rich composition is promising for negatively spin-polarized charge injection in Mn2VGa-based spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast Digital DPC Yielding High Spatio-Temporal Resolution for Low-Dose Phase Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scanning transmission electron microscope, both phase imaging of beam-sensitive materials and characterisation of a material's functional properties using in-situ experiments are becoming more widely available. As the practicable scan speed of 4D-STEM detectors improves, so too does the temporal resolution achievable for both differential phase contrast (DPC) and ptychography. However, the read-out burden of pixelated detectors, and the size of the gigabyte to terabyte sized data sets, remain a challenge for both temporal resolution and their practical adoption. In this work, we show that a high-fidelity DPC phase reconstruction can be achieved from both annular segmented detectors or pixelated arrays with relatively few elements using signal digitisation. Unlike conventional analog data, even at the fastest scan speeds, phase reconstructions from digitised DPC-segment images yield reliable data. Finally, dose fractionation by fast scanning and multi-framing allows for post-process binning of frame streams to balance signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for low-dose phase imaging for in-situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Biaxial strain effects in 2D diamond formation from graphene stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering innovative methods to understand phase transitions, modify phase diagrams, and uncover novel synthesis routes poses significant and far-reaching challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of nanodiamond-like sp3 carbon from few-layer graphene (FLG) stacks at room temperature and relatively low transition pressure (~7.0 GPa) due to chemical interaction with water and physical biaxial strain induced by substrate compression. By employing resonance Raman and optical absorption spectroscopies at high-pressure on FLG systems, utilizing van der Waals heterostructures (hBN/FLG) on different substrates (SiO2/Si and diamond), we originally unveiled the key role of biaxial strain. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations corroborates the pivotal role of both water and biaxial strain in locally stabilizing sp3 carbon structures at the graphene-ice interface. This breakthrough directly enhances nanodiamond technology but also establishes biaxial strain engineering as a promising tool to explore novel phases of 2D nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Accurate Machine Learning Potentials for Metal-Organic Frameworks using Temperature Driven Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how structural flexibility affects the properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for the design of better MOFs for targeted applications. Flexible MOFs can be studied with molecular dynamics simulations, whose accuracy depends on the force-field used to describe the interatomic interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) and quantum-chemistry methods are highly accurate, but the computational overheads limit their use in long time-dependent simulations for large systems. In contrast, classical force fields usually struggle with the description of coordination bonds.
  In this work we develop a DFT-accurate machine-learning spectral neighbor analysis potential, trained on DFT energies, forces and stress tensors, for two representative MOFs, namely ZIF-8 and MOF-5. Their structural and vibrational properties are then studied as a function of temperature and tightly compared with available experimental data. Most importantly, we demonstrate an active-learning algorithm, based on mapping the relevant internal coordinates, which drastically reduces the number of training data to be computed at the DFT level. Thus, the workflow presented here appears as an efficient strategy for the study of flexible MOFs with DFT accuracy, but at a fraction of the DFT computational cost.</description>

      <title>NO2 adsorption on GaN surface and its interaction with the yellow-luminescence-associated surface state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapping of charge at surface states is a longstanding problem in GaN that hinders a full realization of its potential as a semiconductor for microelectronics. At least part of this charge originates in molecules adsorbed on the GaN surface. Multiple studies have addressed the adsorption of different substances, but the role of adsorbents in the charge-trapping mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the GaN surface selectively adsorbs nitrogen dioxide (NO2) existing in the air in trace amounts. NO2 appears to charge the yellow-luminescence-related surface state. Mild heat treatment in vacuum removes this surface charge, only to be re-absorbed on re-exposure to air. Selective exposure of vacuum-annealed GaN to NO2 reproduces a similar surface charge distribution, as does the exposure to air. Residual gas analysis of the gases desorbed during heat treatment in vacuum shows a large concentration of nitric oxide (NO) released from the surface. These observations suggest that NO2 is selectively adsorbed from the air, deleteriously affecting the electrical properties of air-exposed GaN. The trapping of free electrons as part of the NO2chemisorption process changes the surface charge density, resulting in a change in the surface band bending. Uncontrollable by nature, NO2 adsorption may significantly affect any GaN-based electronic device. However, as shown here, a rather mild heat treatment in vacuum restores the surface state occupancy of GaN to its intrinsic state. If attempted before passivation, this heat treatment may provide a possible solution to longstanding stability problems associated with surface charge trapping in GaN-based devices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer couplings in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 (M = Mo/W, X = N/P/As)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the interlayer coupling effect in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 with M = Mo/W and X = N/P/As. Through the combination of first-principles calculations and analytical formulations, the equilibrium interlayer distance, layer energy difference and interlayer hopping strength are obtained for all six MSi2X4 materials, which are found to be insensitive to the type of M atom but differ significantly between X = N and X = P/As. In homobilayers with close to 0{\deg} twist angles, the interlayer charge redistribution introduces a stacking-dependent interlayer electrostatic potential with a magnitude reaching 0.1 eV in MSi2N4, suggesting that it can be an excellent candidate for studying the sliding ferroelectricity. The interlayer hopping strengths are found to be as large as several tens meV at valence band maxima positions K and {\Gamma}, and ~ 1 meV at the conduction band edge K. The resultant layer-hybridizations vary in a large range under different stacking registries, which can be used to simulate honeycomb lattice models with both trivial and non-trivial band topologies.</description>

      <title>Ice phase classification made easy with score-based denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of ice phases is essential for understanding various physicochemical phenomena. However, such classification for structures simulated with molecular dynamics is complicated by the complex symmetries of ice polymorphs and thermal fluctuations. For this purpose, both traditional order parameters and data-driven machine learning approaches have been employed, but they often rely on expert intuition, specific geometric information, or large training datasets. In this work, we present an unsupervised phase classification framework that combines a score-based denoiser model with a subsequent model-free classification method to accurately identify ice phases. The denoiser model is trained on perturbed synthetic data of ideal reference structures, eliminating the need for large datasets and labeling efforts. The classification step utilizes the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors as the atomic fingerprint, ensuring Euclidean symmetries and transferability to various structural systems. Our approach achieves a remarkable 100\% accuracy in distinguishing ice phases of test trajectories using only seven ideal reference structures of ice phases as model inputs. This demonstrates the generalizability of the score-based denoiser model in facilitating phase identification for complex molecular systems. The proposed classification strategy can be broadly applied to investigate structural evolution and phase identification for a wide range of materials, offering new insights into the fundamental understanding of water and other complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are sub-wavelength patterned layers for controlling waves in physical systems. In optics, meta-surfaces are created by materials with different dielectric constants and are capable of unconventional functionalities. We develop a deep-learning framework for Dirac-material metasurface design for controlling electronic waves. The metasurface is a configuration of circular graphene quantum dots, each created by an electric potential. Employing deep convolutional neural networks, we show that the original scattering wave can be reconstructed with fidelity over 95$\%$, suggesting the feasibility of Dirac electron holography. Additional applications such as plane wave generation, designing broadband, and multi-functionality graphene metasurface systems are illustrated.</description>

Abstract: Molecular adsorption is pivotal in device fabrication and material synthesis for quantum technology. However, elucidating the behavior of physisorption poses technical challenges. Here graphene with ultrahigh sensitivity was utilized to detect ozone adsorption at cryogenic temperatures. Significant hole doping observed in graphene indicates a strong interaction between ozone and graphene. Interestingly, the adsorption exhibits asymmetry with positive and negative gate voltages. The strong affinity of ozone provides a tool to modulate materials and devices, while the gate tunability of adsorption offers new insights into construction and manipulation of oxide quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened phase boundary with enhanced amorphous superconductivity in pressurized In2Te5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law (F = C - P + 2). When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, we expand the sharp phase boundary to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long-range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline-amorphous-crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in-situ synchrotron diffraction, we elucidate that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge-like [Te3]2- trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25 % increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder-augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities in the order parameter space that are mathematically described by topological invariants and cannot be removed by continuous transformations. These defects play a significant role in various fields, ranging from cosmology to solid-state physics and biological matter. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, leading to decades of debate about the existence of topological defects in disordered systems, such as glasses. Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects might emerge in the dynamical properties of glasses under deformation, potentially relating to their plastic behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional colloidal glass system composed of particles interacting by an effective magnetic repulsion. We reveal the presence of topological defects in the eigenspace of the vibrational frequencies of this experimental 2D amorphous solid. The vibrational density of states of this 2D amorphous material exhibits distinct glassy properties such as the presence of a boson peak anomaly. Through extensive numerical and theoretical quantitative analysis, we establish a robust positive correlation between the vibrational characteristics and the total number of topological defects. We furthermore show that defects of opposite charge tend to pair together and prove their local statistical correlation with the "soft spots", the regions more prone to plastic flow. This work provides the experimental confirmation for the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing a complex interplay between topology, disorder, and vibrational behavior.</description>

      <title>Effect of the atomic structure of complexions on the active disconnection mode during shear-coupled grain boundary motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The migration of grain boundaries leads to grain growth in polycrystals and is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in nanocrystalline metals. This migration is due to the movement of dislocation-like defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally applied shear stresses. While this has been studied in detail in recent years, the active disconnection mode was typically associated with specific macroscopic grain boundary parameters. We know, however, that varying microscopic degrees of freedom can lead to different atomic structures without changing the macroscopic parameters. These structures can transition into each other and are called complexions. Here, we investigate $[11\overline{1}]$ symmetric tilt boundaries in fcc metals, where two complexions -- dubbed domino and pearl -- were observed before. We compare these two complexions for two different misorientations: In $\Sigma19$b $[11\overline{1}]$ $(178)$ boundaries, both complexions exhibit the same disconnection mode. The critical stress for nucleation and propagation of disconnections is nevertheless different for domino and pearl. At low temperatures, the Peierls-like barrier for disconnection propagation dominates, while at higher temperatures the nucleation is the limiting factor. For $\Sigma$7 $[11\overline{1}]$ $(145)$ boundaries, we observed a larger difference. The domino and pearl complexions migrate in different directions under the same boundary conditions. While both migration directions are possible crystallographically, an analysis of the complexions' structural motifs and the disconnection core structures reveals that the choice of disconnection mode and therefore migration direction is directly due to the atomic structure of the grain boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are key materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their entangled magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Spiral multiferroics possess ferroelectric polarization and are particularly promising for electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity. In this work, we uncover long-period incommensurate states characterized by unique multiferroic kinks in corundum nickelate Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$, a member of a promising family of polar magnets. Utilizing a 2-orbital $S=1$ model, we derive formulas for Heisenberg and anisotropic magnetic exchanges and magnetically-induced polarization, enabling their calculations from first principles. We use these parameters in Monte Carlo and Landau theory-based calculations to reproduce experimentally observed magnetic structures and polarization dependence on the magnetic field. We predict magnetic phase transitions between flat spiral, conical spiral, canted antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states under increasing magnetic fields. Kinks in the spiral phases repel each other through a Yukawa-like potential arising from exchange of massive magnons. We also find that suitably directed electric fields can be used to stabilize the ferromagnetic and spiral states. The findings open a new pathway to predictive first-principles modelling of multiferroics and will inspire experiments and technological applications based on multiferroic kinks.</description>

      <title>Effect of the depolarizing field on the domain structure of an improper ferroelectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, contrary to common belief, the depolarizing electric field generated by bound charges at thin-film surfaces can have a substantial impact on the domain structure of an improper ferroelectric with topological defects. In hexagonal-manganite thin films, we observe in phase-field simulations that through the action of the depolarizing field, (i) the average magnitude of the polarization density decreases, (ii) the local magnitude of the polarization density decreases with increasing distance from the domain walls, and (iii) there is a significant alteration of the domain-size distribution, which is visualized with the pair-correlation function. We conclude that, in general, it is not appropriate to ignore the effects of the depolarizing field for thin film ferroelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and fast prediction of materials properties is central to the digital transformation of materials design. However, the vast design space and diverse operating conditions pose significant challenges for accurately modeling arbitrary material candidates and forecasting their properties. We present MatterSim, a deep learning model actively learned from large-scale first-principles computations, for efficient atomistic simulations at first-principles level and accurate prediction of broad material properties across the periodic table, spanning temperatures from 0 to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 GPa. Out-of-the-box, the model serves as a machine learning force field, and shows remarkable capabilities not only in predicting ground-state material structures and energetics, but also in simulating their behavior under realistic temperatures and pressures, signifying an up to ten-fold enhancement in precision compared to the prior best-in-class. This enables MatterSim to compute materials' lattice dynamics, mechanical and thermodynamic properties, and beyond, to an accuracy comparable with first-principles methods. Specifically, MatterSim predicts Gibbs free energies for a wide range of inorganic solids with near-first-principles accuracy and achieves a 15 meV/atom resolution for temperatures up to 1000K compared with experiments. This opens an opportunity to predict experimental phase diagrams of materials at minimal computational cost. Moreover, MatterSim also serves as a platform for continuous learning and customization by integrating domain-specific data. The model can be fine-tuned for atomistic simulations at a desired level of theory or for direct structure-to-property predictions, achieving high data efficiency with a reduction in data requirements by up to 97%.</description>

      <title>Low temperature spin Seebeck effect in non-magnetic vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is sensitive to thermally driven magnetic excitations in magnetic insulators. Vanadium dioxide in its insulating low temperature phase is expected to lack magnetic degrees of freedom, as vanadium atoms are thought to form singlets upon dimerization of the vanadium chains. Instead, we find a paramagnetic SSE response in VO2 films that grows as the temperature decreases below 50 K. The field and temperature dependent SSE voltage is qualitatively consistent with a general model of paramagnetic SSE response and inconsistent with triplet spin transport. Quantitative estimates find a spin Seebeck coefficient comparable in magnitude to that observed in strongly magnetic materials. The microscopic nature of the magnetic excitations in VO2 requires further examination.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Chiral Symmetry and Symmetry-Class Conversion in Floquet Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$ quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.</description>

      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility of polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g., crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Creation and Manipulation of Higher-Order Topological States by Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to implement tunable higher-order topological states in a heterojunction consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator and the recently discovered altermagnets, whose unique spin-polarization in both real and reciprocal space and null magnetization are in contrast to conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Based on symmetry analysis and effective edge theory, we show that the special spin splitting in altermagnets with different symmetries, such as $d$-wave, can introduce Dirac mass terms with opposite signs on the adjacent boundaries of the topological insulator, resulting in the higher-order topological state with mass-domain bound corner states. Moreover, by adjusting the direction of the N\'{e}el vector, we can manipulate such topological corner states by moving their positions. By first-principles calculations, taking a 2D topological insulator bismuthene with a square lattice on an altermagnet MnF$_2$ as an example, we demonstrate the feasibility of creating and manipulating the higher-order topological states through altermagnets. Finally, we discuss the experimental implementation and detection of the tunable topological corner states, as well as the potential non-Abelian braiding of the Dirac corner fermions.</description>
