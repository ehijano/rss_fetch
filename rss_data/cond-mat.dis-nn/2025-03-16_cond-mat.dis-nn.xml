      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond rotational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. Here we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a \emph{denoising-factorisation transition} separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theory side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our complete ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole phase diagram when considering finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Exact Replica Symmetric solution for transverse field Hopfield model under finite Trotter size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Deep thermalization" describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We put forth a universal ansatz for the limiting form of the projected ensemble, motivated by maximum-entropy principles rooted in statistical physics and quantum information theory. This limiting form depends on a polynomial amount of data on the initial state and measurement basis, a `coarse-graining' that is an essential feature of bona fide thermodynamic ensembles. We support our ansatz with three complementary approaches: (i) a rigorous proof in the simplest case of no charge fluctuations in either the initial state or the measurement basis; (ii) analytical calculations using a `replica limit' approach, applicable when charge fluctuations are allowed in either the input state or the measurement basis but not both; (iii) extensive numerical simulations of finite-sized systems in the most general case. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.</description>
