      <title>Two models of sparse and clustered dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two models of sparse dynamic networks that display transitivity - the tendency for vertices sharing a common neighbour to be neighbours of one another. Our first network is a continuous time Markov chain $G=\{G_t=(V,E_t), t\ge 0\}$ whose states are graphs with the common vertex set $V=\{1,\dots, n\}$. The transitions are defined as follows. Given $t$, the vertex pairs $\{i,j\}\subset V$ are assigned independent exponential waiting times $A_{ij}$. At time $t+\min_{ij} A_{ij}$ the pair $\{i_0,j_0\}$ with $A_{i_0j_0}=\min_{ij} A_{ij}$ toggles its adjacency status. To mimic clustering patterns of sparse real networks we set intensities $a_{ij}$ of exponential times $A_{ij}$ to be negatively correlated with the degrees of the common neighbours of vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G_t$. Another dynamic network is based on a latent Markov chain $H=\{H_t=(V\cup W, E_t), t\ge 0\}$ whose states are bipartite graphs with the bipartition $V\cup W$, where $W=\{1,\dots,m\}$ is an auxiliary set of attributes/affiliations. Our second network $G'=\{G'_t =(E'_t,V), t\ge 0\}$ is the affiliation network defined by $H$: vertices $i_1,i_2\in V$ are adjacent in $G'_t$ whenever $i_1$ and $i_2$ have a common neighbour in $H_t$. We analyze geometric properties of both dynamic networks at stationarity and show that networks possess high clustering. They admit tunable degree distribution and clustering coefficients.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions of the SI and Bass models on sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and regular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit expressions for the expected adoption and infection level in the Bass and SI models, respectively, on sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and on $d$-regular networks. These expressions are soloutions of first-order ordinary differential equations, which are fairly easy to analyze. To prove that these expressions are exact, we show that the effect of cycles vanishes as the network size goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Edge universality of $\beta$-additions through Dunkl operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give characterizations of the transition semigroup and generator of a continuous-time Derrida--Retaux type process that generalizes the one introduced by Hu, Mallein and Pain (Commun. Math. Phys., 2020). It is shown that the process arises naturally as the scaling limit of the discrete-time max-type recursive models introduced by Hu and Shi (J. Stat. Phys., 2018).</description>

      <title>Sample path properties and small ball probabilities for stochastic fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following stochastic space-time fractional diffusion equation with vanishing initial condition:$$ \partial^{\beta} u(t, x)=- \left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha / 2} u(t, x)+ I_{0+}^{\gamma}\left[\dot{W}(t, x)\right],\quad t\in[0,T],\: x \in \mathbb{R}^d,$$ where $\alpha&gt;0$, $\beta\in(0,2)$, $\gamma\in[0,1)$, $\left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha/2}$ is the fractional/power of Laplacian and $\dot{W}$ is a fractional space-time Gaussian noise. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution and then focus on various sample path regularity properties of the solution. More specifically, we establish the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity and Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm. The small ball probability is also studied.</description>

      <title>Superposition of interacting stochastic processes with memory and its application to biological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes with long memories, known as long memory processes, are ubiquitous in various science and engineering problems. Superposing Markovian stochastic processes generates a non-Markovian long memory process serving as powerful tools in several research fields, including physics, mathematical economics, and environmental engineering. We formulate two novel mathematical models of long memory process based on a superposition of interacting processes driven by jumps. The mutual excitation among the processes to be superposed is assumed to be of the mean field or aggregation form, where the former yields a more analytically tractable model. The statistics of the proposed long memory processes are investigated using their moment-generating function, autocorrelation, and associated generalized Riccati equations. Finally, the proposed models are applied to time series data of migrating fish counts at river observation points. The results of this study suggest that an exponential memory or a long memory model is insufficient; however, a unified method that can cover both is necessary to analyze fish migration, and our model is exactly the case.</description>

      <title>A pursuit problem for squared Bessel processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we are interested in the probability that two independent squared Bessel processes do not cross for a long time. We show that this probability has a power decay which is given by the first zero of some hypergeometric function. We also compute along the way the distribution of the location where the crossing eventually occurs, as well as some Cram{\'e}r's estimates for squared Bessel processes perturbed by a power drift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A traffic model on an open one-dimensional lattice is considered. At any discrete time moment, with prescribed probability, a particle arrives to the leftmost cell of the lattice, and, with prescribed probability, the arriving particle belongs to one of the types characterized by the probabilities of particle attempts to move at the present time and the probabilities to leave the system. An approximate approach to compute the particle flow rate and density in cells is proposed. It is proven that, for a particular case of the system, the approach gives exact results.</description>

      <title>Multi-type branching processes with immigration generated by point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the pivotal work of Sevastyanov, who considered branching processes with homogeneous Poisson immigration, much has been done to understand the behaviour of such processes under different types of branching and immigration mechanisms. Recently, the case where the times of immigration are generated by a non-homogeneous Poisson process was considered in depth. In this work, we try to demonstrate how one can use the framework of point processes in order to go beyond the Poisson process. As an illustration, we show how to transfer techniques from the case of Poisson immigration to the case where it is spanned by a determinantal point process.</description>

      <title>Canonical insurance models: stochastic equations and comparison theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thiele's differential equation explains the change in prospective reserve and plays a fundamental role in safe-side calculations and other types of actuarial model comparisons. This paper presents a `model lean' version of Thiele's equation with the novel feature that it supports any canonical insurance model, irrespective of the model's intertemporal dependence structure. The basis for this is a canonical and path-wise model construction that simultaneously handles discrete and absolutely continuous modeling regimes. Comparison theorems for differing canonical insurance models follow directly from the resulting stochastic backward equations. The elegance with which these comparison theorems handle non-equivalence of probability measures is one of their major advantages over previous results.</description>

      <title>Random signed measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point processes and, more generally, random measures are ubiquitous in modern statistics. However, they can only take positive values, which is a severe limitation in many situations. In this work, we introduce and study random signed measures, also known as real-valued random measures, and apply them to constrcut various Bayesian non-parametric models. In particular, we provide an existence result for random signed measures, allowing us to obtain a canonical definition for them and solve a 70-year-old open problem. Further, we provide a representation of completely random signed measures (CRSMs), which extends the celebrated Kingman's representation for completely random measures (CRMs) to the real-valued case. We then introduce specific classes of random signed measures, including the Skellam point process, which plays the role of the Poisson point process in the real-valued case, and the Gaussian random measure. We use the theoretical results to develop two Bayesian nonparametric models -- one for topic modeling and the other for random graphs -- and to investigate mean function estimation in Bayesian nonparametric regression.</description>

      <title>Excursion theory for Markov processes indexed by Levy trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an excursion theory that describes the evolution of a Markov process indexed by a Levy tree away from a regular and instantaneous point $x$ of the state space. The theory builds upon a notion of local time at $x$ that was recently introduced in [37]. Despite the radically different setting, our results exhibit striking similarities to the classical excursion theory for $\mathbb{R}_+$-indexed Markov processes. We then show that the genealogy of the excursions can be encoded in a Levy tree called the tree coded by the local time. In particular, we recover by different methods the excursion theory of Abraham and Le Gall [2], which was developed for Brownian motion indexed by the Brownian tree.</description>

      <title>Triangle functions generated by products of quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that, given a left continuous t-norm $T$ on $[0,1]$ and a right continuous $\CL$-operation $L$ on $[0,\infty]$, then their tensor product $L\otimes T$ is a triangle function on $\Delp$. Hence, $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ becomes a partially ordered monoid. In this paper, it is shown that: (1) $L\otimes T$ coincides with the triangle function $\tau_{T,L}$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the condition $(LCS)$; (2) let $\CDp$ be the set of all non-defective distance distribution functions, then $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ is a submonoid of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ has no zero divisor; (3) let $\CDp_c$ be the set of all continuous distance distribution functions, then for each continuous t-norm $T$, $(\CDp_c, L\otimes T)$ is a subsemigroup of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the condition $(LS)$. Moreover, $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is an ideal of $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the cancellation law.</description>

      <title>Funnel theorems for spreading on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive novel analytic tools for the Bass and SI models on networks for the spreading of innovations and epidemics on networks. We prove that the correlation between the nonadoption (noninfection) probabilities of $L \ge 2$ disjoint subsets of nodes $\{A_l\}_{l=1}^L$ is non-negative, find the necessary and sufficient condition that determines whether this correlation is positive or zero, and provide an upper bound for its magnitude. Using this result, we prove the funnel theorems, which provide lower and upper bounds for the difference between the non-adoption probability of a node and the product of its nonadoption probabilities on $L$ modified networks in which the node under consideration is only influenced by incoming edges from $A_l$ for $l=1, \dots, L$. The funnel theorems can be used, among other things, to explicitly compute the exact expected adoption/infection level on various types of networks, both with and without cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here the definitions of nearest neighbor, robustness, concordance, and correlation, all of which feature in (Temple 2023) (henceforth abbreviated (T23)), are adjusted to make them completely mathematical while preserving their significance. A characterization is given of the possible limits of a function of distance matrices as the data matrices from which they are derived acquire more and more columns while their number of rows and the distance defining norm (= coefficient, in the terminology of (T23)) are held fixed. No data contribute to the discussion here, but many examples, with standard norms and data matrices having just a few rows and columns, play an important role. Indeed, small data matrices are displayed showing that robustness, defined either of the two ways, can be zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caffarelli's contraction theorem bounds the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-convex measure and a strongly log-concave measure. We show that an analogous phenomenon holds on the level of the trace: The trace of the derivative of the optimal transport map between a log-subharmonic measure and a strongly log-concave measure is bounded. We show that this trace bound has a number of consequences pertaining to volume-contracting transport maps, majorization and its monotonicity along Wasserstein geodesics, growth estimates of log-subharmonic functions, the Wehrl conjecture for Glauber states, and two-dimensional Coulomb gases. We also discuss volume-contraction properties for the Kim-Milman transport map</description>

      <title>Mirror Descent Algorithms for Risk Budgeting Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and examines numerical approximation schemes for computing risk budgeting portfolios associated to positive homogeneous and sub-additive risk measures. We employ Mirror Descent algorithms to determine the optimal risk budgeting weights in both deterministic and stochastic settings, establishing convergence along with an explicit non-asymptotic quantitative rate for the averaged algorithm. A comprehensive numerical analysis follows, illustrating our theoretical findings across various risk measures -- including standard deviation, Expected Shortfall, deviation measures, and Variantiles -- and comparing the performance with that of the standard stochastic gradient descent method recently proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the notion of random Dehn function and compute an asymptotic upper bound for finitely presented acylindrically hyperbolic groups whose Dehn function is at most polynomial with integer exponent. By showing that in these cases the random Dehn function is strictly smaller than the usual Dehn function we confirm Gromov's intuition albeit in a different model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harmonic balls are domains which satisfy the mean-value property for harmonic functions. We establish the existence and uniqueness of harmonic balls on Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces using the obstacle problem formulation of Hele-Shaw flow. We show that LQG harmonic balls are neither Lipschitz domains nor LQG metric balls, and that the boundaries of their complementary connected components are Jordan curves.
  We conjecture that LQG harmonic balls are the scaling limit of internal diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) on random planar maps. In a companion paper, we prove this in the special case of mated-CRT maps.</description>

      <title>On a sufficient condition for explosion in CMJ branching processes and applications to recursive trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide sufficient criteria for explosion in Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process, via the process producing an infinite path in finite time. As an application, we deduce a curious phase-transition in the infinite tree associated with a class of recursive tree models with fitness, showing that in one regime every node in the tree has infinite degree, whilst in another, the tree is locally finite, with a unique infinite path. The latter class encompasses many models studied in the literature, including the weighted random recursive tree, the preferential attachment tree with additive fitness, and the Bianconi-Barab\'asi model, or preferential attachment tree with multiplicative fitness.</description>

      <title>General duality and dual attainment for adapted transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate duality and existence of dual optimizers for several adapted optimal transport problems under minimal assumptions. This includes the causal and bicausal transport, the causal and bicausal barycenter problem, and a multimarginal problem incorporating causality constraints. Moreover, we characterize polar sets in the causal and bicausal setting and discuss applications of our results in robust finance. We consider a non-dominated model of several financial markets where stocks are traded dynamically, but the joint stock dynamics are unknown. We show that a no-arbitrage assumption naturally leads to sets of multicausal couplings. Consequently, computing the robust superhedging price is equivalent to solving an adapted transport problem, and finding a superhedging strategy means solving the corresponding dual.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics of solutions for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a novel version of three-dimensional (3D) globally modified Navier-Stokes (GMNS) system introduced by [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436], which is very significant from the perspective of deterministic as well as stochastic partial differential equations. Our focus is on examining a stochastic version of the suggested 3D GMNS equations that are perturbed by an infinite-dimensional additive noise. We can consider a rough additive noise (Lebesgue space valued) with this model, which is not appropriate to consider with the system presented in [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436]. One of the technical problems associated with the rough noise is overcome by the use of the corresponding Cameron-Martin (or reproducing kernel Hilbert) space. This article aims to accomplish three objectives. Firstly, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions (in the analytic sense) of the underlying stochastic system using a Doss-Sussman transformation and a primary ingredient Minty-Browder technique. Secondly, we demonstrate the existence of random attractors for the underlying stochastic system in the natural space of square integrable divergence-free functions. Finally, we show the existence of an invariant measure for the underlying stochastic system for any viscosity coefficient $ \nu &gt; 0 $ and uniqueness of invariant measure for sufficiently large $\nu$ by using the exponential stability of solutions. A validation of the proposed version of 3D GMNS equations has also been discussed in the appendix by establishing that the sequence of weak solutions of 3D GMNS equations converges to a weak solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equations as the modification parameter goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar and Li--M\'edard Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. When focusing on the symmetric $q$-stability, combining this result with our previous bound, we use computer-assisted methods to prove that dictator functions maximize the symmetric $q$-stability for $q=1$ and $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ or for $q\in[1.36,2)$ and all $\rho\in[0,1]$. In other words, we confirm the (balanced) Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ and the (symmetrized) Li--M\'edard conjecture with $q\in[1.36,2)$. We conjecture that dictator functions maximize both the symmetric and asymmetric $\frac{1}{2}$-stability over all balanced Boolean functions. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic partial differential equation, $\partial_t u = \tfrac12 \partial^2_x u + b(u) + \sigma(u) \dot{W},$ where $u=u(t\,,x)$ is defined for $(t\,,x)\in(0\,,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot{W}$ denotes space-time white noise. We prove that this SPDE is well posed solely under the assumptions that the initial condition $u(0)$ is bounded and measurable, and $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz continuous functions and have at most linear growth. Our method is based on a truncation argument together with moment bounds and tail estimates of the truncated solution. The results naturally generalize to the case where $b$ and $\sigma$ are time dependent with uniform-in-time growth and oscillation properties. Additionally, our method can be extended to the stochastic wave equation.</description>

This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Semimartingale driven mechanics and reduction by symmetry for stochastic and dissipative dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent interest in structure preserving stochastic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems raises questions regarding how such models are to be understood and the principles through which they are to be derived. By considering a mathematically sound extension of the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we derive a stochastic analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equations, driven by independent semimartingales. Using this as a starting point, we can apply symmetry reduction carefully to derive non-canonical stochastic Lagrangian / Hamiltonian systems, including the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e / Lie-Poisson equations, studied extensively in the literature. Furthermore, we develop a framework to include dissipation that balances the structure-preserving noise in such a way that the overall stochastic dynamics preserves the Gibbs measure on the symplectic manifold, where the dynamics effectively take place. In particular, this leads to a new derivation of double-bracket dissipation by considering Lie group invariant stochastic dissipative dynamics, taking place on the cotangent bundle of the group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

      <title>Free Stein Kernel and Moments maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a free analogue to Fathi's construction of Stein kernels using moment maps (2019). This is possible for a class of measures called free moment measures that was introduced in the free case by Bahr and Boschert (2021), and by using the notion of free moment maps which are convex functions, solutions of a variant of the free Monge-Amp\`ere equation discovered by Guionnet and Shlyakhtenko (2012). We then show how regularity estimates in some weighted non-commutative Sobolev spaces on these maps control the transport distances to the semicircular law. We also prove in the one dimensional case a free analogue of the moment map version of the Cafarelli contraction theorem (2001), discovered by Klartag in the classical case (2014), and which leads to a uniform bound on the free moment Stein kernel. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results: we prove a stability result characterizing the semicircular distribution among a certain subclass of free Gibbs measures, the probabilistic interpretation of this free moment Stein kernel in terms of free diffusion processes, its connections with the theory of non-commutative Dirichlet forms, and a possible notion of a non-commutative (free) Hessian manifold associated with a free Gibbs measure, conjecturally having free analogue properties of a classical Hessian manifold associated with a log-concave measure and considered by Kolesnikov (2012), which has the striking property of having a Ricci curvature bounded from below by $1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5 years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a variational formulation to define a generalized notion of perimeter, from which we derive abstract isoperimetric Cheeger's inequalities via gradient estimates on solutions of Poisson equations. Our abstract framework unifies many existing results and in particular allows us to recover the $W_1-W^{1,1}$ transport inequality, which strengthens the usual transport-information inequality. Conversely, we also prove that Cheeger's inequality implies certain first order Calder{\'o}n-Zygmund-type gradient estimates.</description>
