      <title>Universal wrinkling dynamics of a sheet on viscous liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wrinkling dynamics of a thin elastic sheet that is indented or compressed while floating on a viscous liquid. We show that the deformation speed controls the dynamics, leading to a wrinkle wavelength significantly smaller than that selected under quasistatic compression. Once active compression ceases, the wrinkles coarsen until their wavelength relaxes toward the equilibrium value. We develop a theoretical model coupling Stokes flow in the liquid to elastic bending of the sheet, which quantitatively predicts both the initial wavelength selection and its subsequent coarsening. We demonstrate that the same mechanism governs two dimensional and axisymmetric geometries, thereby extending classical static wavelength selection laws to dynamic situations. Although developed from controlled laboratory experiments, the model captures a generic viscous-elastic coupling and applies broadly to thin elastic films interacting with viscous environments, including the formation of surface wrinkles in pahoehoe lava flows.</description>

      <title>Space-resolved stress correlations and viscoelastic moduli for polydisperse systems: the faces of the stress noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several advances in the theory of space-resolved viscoelasticity of liquids and other amorphous systems are discussed in the present paper. In particular, considering long-time regimes of stress relaxation in liquids we obtain the generalized compressibility equation valid for systems with mass polydispersity, and derive a new relation allowing to calculate the wavevector-dependent equilibrium transverse modulus in terms of the generalized structure factors. Turning to the basic relations between the spatially-resolved relaxation moduli and the spatio-temporal correlation functions of the stress tensor, we provide their new derivation based on a conceptually simple argument that does not involve consideration of non-stationary processes. We also elucidate the relationship between the stress noise associated with the classical Newtonian dynamics and the reduced deviatoric stress coming from the Zwanzig-Mori projection operator formalism. The general relations between the stress noise and the tensor of relaxation moduli are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Prediction of Polymer Relaxation Dynamics via Computational and Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description>

      <title>Griffiths-like region explains the dynamic anomaly in metallic glass-forming liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex fluids such as water exhibits many anomalous phenomena, and research suggests these properties are closely tied to critical fluctuations near the liquid-liquid phase transition critical point (LLCP). However, whether a similar LLCP exists in metallic glass-forming liquids, which are notable for their high atomic coordination, remains an open question. Although dynamic anomalies such as the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation have often been attributed to dynamic heterogeneity or structural changes, relatively few studies have analyzed these anomalies from a thermodynamic-fluctuation perspective. This gap probably stems from the challenges in detecting density-driven phase transitions in such systems. Here, we use numerical simulations to explore the thermodynamic mechanisms behind dynamic anomalies in a prototypical metallic glass-forming melt. We observe substantial thermodynamic fluctuations near a particular region, which likely corresponds to a frustration state of liquid, vapor, and glass. These fluctuations may contribute to the violation of the SE relation. Our findings offer a fresh Griffiths-like perspective on the dynamic anomalies seen in supercooled metallic liquids, and shed new light on their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Counting unlabelled multigraphs with three nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlabeled multigraphs have diverse applications across scientific fields, from transportation and social networks to polymer physics. In particular, multigraphs are essential for studying the relationship between the spatial organization and biological function of chromatin, which is often folded into complex polymer networks whose structure is closely tied to patterns of gene expression. A fundamental yet challenging aspect in applying graph theory to these areas is the enumeration of multigraphs, especially under structural constraints For example, when coupled with the statistical mechanics of polymer networks, the ability to identify traversable and connected multigraphs provides powerful tools for predicting statistically favored motifs that may arise within chromatin networks. In this work, by counting the adjacency matrices, we derive polynomial expressions that enumerate all connected, undirected, and unlabeled multigraphs with three nodes and fixed degree, and provide a method to efficiently generate them.</description>

      <title>Structure and Memory Control Self-Diffusion in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive progress in characterizing the emergent behavior of active matter, the microscopic origins of self-diffusion in interacting active systems remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a framework that quantitatively links self-diffusion to collisional forces and their temporal correlations in active fluids. We show that transport is governed by two contributions: an equal-time suppression of motion arising from anisotropic collisional forces, and a memory correction associated with the temporal persistence of these forces. Together, these effects yield an exact expression for the self-diffusivity in terms of measurable force statistics and correlation times. We apply this framework to purely repulsive active Brownian particles and find that self-diffusion is always reduced, with collisional memory acting as a strictly dissipative correction. Our results establish a direct connection between microscopic force correlations and macroscopic transport, providing a general mechanical perspective for interpreting self-diffusion in active matter.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of Ultrasound-Induced Mechanical Degradation of Microgels: Effects of Mechanoresponsive Crosslinks, Softness, and Core-Shell Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound-induced degradation of soft polymeric colloids, like microgels, as well as a controlled drug release enabled by mechanoresponsive bonds, has recently attracted considerable attention. However, most examples in the literature focus primarily on the applications rather than examining the underlying mechanisms of the structural changes occurring in microgels due to cavitation - changes that are crucial for developing effective drug delivery systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive view on how microgel structure governs the susceptibility to rupture and mass loss upon cavitation, investigating both conventional microgels containing mechanoresponsive disulfide bonds and more complex asymmetrically crosslinked core-shell microgels. By combining dynamic and static light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that an interplay between mechanoresponsive crosslinks and the swelling degree determines the microgels susceptibility to ultrasound-induced damage. Our findings indicate that local stress from cavitation bubbles varies strongly within the microgel dispersion. The majority of microgels undergo gradual erosion at their periphery, resulting in smaller yet structurally intact particles over time, observable by light scattering and AFM. In contrast, microgels closer to a cavitation bubble can experience partial rupture or completely disintegrate, producing smaller, more polydisperse fragments, which contributes substantially to the overall mass loss observed. In the core-shell microgels with different crosslinkers in the core and shell, degradation occurs nearly uniformly across both regions, instead of selectively targeting the weaker part. These observations highlight the complexity of the degradation dynamics as well as the similarity to processes seen in linear polymers and bulk hydrogels.</description>

      <title>Onset of stripe order in classical fluids: Lessons from lattice-gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two molecular species with mutual affinity are mixed together, various self-assembled phases can arise at low temperature, depending on the shape of like and unlike interactions. Among them, stripes -- where layers of one type are regularly alternated with layers of another type -- hold a prominent place in materials science, occurring e.g. in the structure of superconductive doped antiferromagnets. Stripe patterns are relevant for the design of functional materials, with applications in optoelectronics, sensing, and biomedicine. In a purely classical setting, an open question pertains to the features that spherically-symmetric particle interactions must have to foster stripe order. Here we address this challenge for a lattice-gas mixture of two particle species, whose equilibrium properties are exactly determined by Monte Carlo simulations with Wang-Landau sampling, in both planar and spherical geometry, and for equal chemical potentials of the species. Somewhat surprisingly, stripes can emerge from largely different off-core interactions, featuring various combinations of repulsive like interactions with a predominantly attractive unlike interaction. In addition to stripes, our survey also unveils crystals and crystal-like structures, cluster crystals, and networks, which considerably broaden the catalog of possible patterns. Overall, our study demonstrates that stripes are more widespread than generally thought, as they can be generated by several distinct mechanisms, thereby explaining why stripe patterns are observed in systems as diverse as cuprate materials, biomaterials, and nanoparticle films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common New England sight of a cranberry bog presents a rich tapestry of fluid dynamics and soft matter phenomena. Here, we present four connected problems exploring the behavior of cranberries in their stages of harvest: the buoyant rise of a cranberry in a flooded bog, the stable floating configuration of a cranberry on the surface, the aggregation and interaction between many floating cranberries collected with a boom, and the piling of cranberries onto a truck for transportation. We model these phenomena from first principles and develop simple computational simulations of their collective behaviors. Additionally, we describe tabletop experiments to accompany these problems, either as in-class demonstrations or lab activities. Throughout, we draw connections to broader physical principles in soft condensed matter and fluids, allowing the real-world example of the cranberry bog to serve as a bridge between the undergraduate curriculum and topics in soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Reversible to Irreversible Transitions in Pattern-Forming Systems with Cyclic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitions from reversible to irreversible or fluctuating states above a critical density and shear amplitude have been extensively studied in non-thermal cyclically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids. Here, we propose that the same type of reversible to irreversible transition occurs for a system of particles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion, which can form crystals, stripes, and bubbles as the ratio of attraction to repulsion varies. By oscillating the strength of the attractive part of the potential, we find that the system can organize into either time-periodic states consisting of nondiffusive complex closed orbits, or into a diffusive fluctuating state. A critical point separates these states as a function of the maximum strength of the attraction, oscillation frequency, and particle density. We also find a re-entrant behavior of the reversible state as a function of the strength of the attraction and the oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>Atomic Alignment in PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices with Compact Inorganic Ligands via Reversible Oriented Attachment of Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanocrystals (NCs) serve as versatile building blocks for the creation of functional materials, with NC self-assembly offering opportunities to enable novel material properties. Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>Unified multifractal description of longitudinal and transverse intermittency in fully developed turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale intermittency is a defining feature of fully developed fluid turbulence, marked by rare and extreme fluctuations of velocity increments and gradients that defy mean-field descriptions. Existing multifractal descriptions of intermittency focus primarily on longitudinal increments and gradients, despite mounting evidence that transverse components exhibit distinct and stronger intermittency. Here, we develop a unified multifractal framework that jointly prescribes longitudinal and transverse velocity increments, and extends to gradients. We derive explicit relations linking inertial-range scaling exponents of structure functions to moments of velocity gradients in dissipation range. Our results reveal that longitudinal gradient scaling is solely prescribed by longitudinal structure functions, as traditionally expected; however, transverse gradient scaling is prescribed by mixed longitudinal-transverse structure functions. Validation with high-resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence, at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to $1300$ demonstrates excellent agreement, paving way for a more complete and predictive description of intermittency faithful to the underlying turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inertia-Dilatancy Interplay Governs Shear-Thickening Drop Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining high-speed photography with direct force measurements, we investigate the impact dynamics of drops of cornstarch-water mixtures -- a premier example of shear-thickening fluids -- across a wide range of impact conditions. Our study identifies three distinct impact regimes. In addition to the liquid-like and solid-like behaviors generally expected for the impact-induced response of shear-thickening fluids, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which high-concentration cornstarch-water mixtures display a liquid-like response at the onset of impact when shear rates are high and only transition to a solid-like behavior at later times as shear rates reduce. By integrating the classic drop-impact theory with the Reynolds-Darcy mechanism for dilatancy, we develop a unified model that quantitatively describes the impact dynamics of shear-thickening drops across all regimes. Our work reveals the unexpected response of shear-thickening fluids to ultra-fast deformation and advances fundamental understanding of drop impact for complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the Orderphobic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of lattice-gas systems defined on semiregular grids, obtained by projecting the vertices of three different geodesic icosahedra onto a spherical surface. By using couplings up to third neighbors we explore various interaction patterns, ranging from core-corona repulsion to square-well attraction and short-range attractive, long-range repulsive potentials. The relatively small number of sites in each grid ($\sim 100$) enables us to compute the exact statistical properties of the systems as a function of temperature and chemical potential by Wang-Landau sampling. For each case considered we highlight the existence of distinct low-temperature ``phases'', featuring, among others, regular-polyhedral, cluster-crystal, and worm-like structures. We highlight similarities and differences between these motifs and those observed on the triangular lattice under the same conditions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for the bottom-up realization of spherical templates with desired functionalities.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of Smoluchowski coagulation equation combined with Ostwald ripening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processes of simultaneous coagulation and Ostwald ripening of particles in the concluding stage of phase transformation are considered. We solve the integro-differential system of Smoluchowski-type kinetic and mass balance equations using a computationally efficient numerical algorithm based on low-rank matrices. We compare our numerical solutions for different initial particle-volume distributions with the universal distribution function for combined coagulation and Ostwald ripening. Our calculations confirm the tendency of a particulate ensemble to the universal particle-volume distribution to be approached asymptotically after a sufficiently long time, no matter what the initial particle-volume distribution might be.</description>

      <title>Universal Coarsening and Giant-Cluster Formation in Growing Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clusters formed by fluctuations of two-dimensional (2D) directed interfaces around a threshold level have been extensively studied at equilibrium and in nonequilibrium steady states, but their coarsening dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate this unexplored coarsening of clusters in 2D growing interfaces believed to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Using a two-point spatial correlator, we demonstrate statistical time invariance of the evolving configurations and identify scaling forms shared across distinct models. We reveal a pronounced asymmetry in the growth of the largest clusters: one cluster emerges as a giant structure whose characteristic length exceeds the correlation length. Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered. These findings highlight new universal aspects of growing interfaces and suggest avenues for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Using extensive simulations to generate long time-series of such buckling events, we show that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material characterized by a logarithmically growing length-scale. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Linear Time-Variant Rheology for Aging, Relaxation, and Creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most materials age, and their properties change over time. The aging of materials is reflected in their mechanical responses to external stress and strain, which exhibit logarithmic relaxation and universal power-law creep. Those responses are typically described using complex phenomenological models, including fractional viscoelastic models. While successful at reproducing experimental trends, such approaches often obscure the underlying rheological mechanism and its connection to material parameters. Their physical interpretation remains debated. We introduce jerk-elasticity, a linear time-variant model whose constitutive relations are motivated by thermodynamic principles and experimental observations of the stick-slip-induced friction. The model reproduces the Guiu-Pratt law of logarithmic stress relaxation, Andrade's power-law creep, and a unified description of the three stages of creep, without invoking distributed relaxation times or nonlinear constitutive laws. The rheological parameters of jerk-elasticity are linked with the thermodynamic variables and activation volume. The evolution of activation volume emerges as a physically interpretable measure of aging. Interestingly, viscous and fractional Maxwell responses appear as limiting cases of the jerk-elastic response, thereby offering a unified constitutive interpretation of fractional rheology. Besides, the Mittag-Leffler function gains physical interpretation. The findings are validated by established experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Interfacially arrested melting in thin films: capillarity-driven suspension of phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Melting is typically viewed as a bulk first-order phase transition that proceeds once nucleation barriers are overcome. Here we demonstrate an interfacially arrested melting regime in molecularly thin crystalline films, where large liquid droplets remain stably trapped well above the bulk melting temperature. Using long-chain alkane films as a model system, we show that melting is suspended by the competition between bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energy costs associated with capillary confinement. The arrested state is governed by a single control parameter, the product of temperature offset and film thickness, and is independent of droplet size. As a consequence, small temperature variations produce pronounced and reversible changes in droplet morphology, enabling intrinsic thermodynamic amplification of thermal signals. These results reveal a general mechanism by which interfacial constraints can arrest first-order phase transitions in thin films.</description>

      <title>Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic polymers have been studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes; however, the mechanisms governing their behavior in combined flow and electric fields remain poorly understood. To address this, we model charged polymers across scales. We extend the Rouse model to include charge density along the polymer chain and ambient electric fields, deriving the shear stress under homogeneous shear and electric fields. Viscosity exhibits anisotropic enhancement dependent on field-flow orientation with a scaling factor dependent on a charge sequence relaxation time, dielectric constant, and quadratic electric field term. These results inform a new continuum model--the upper-convected electro-Maxwell (UCEM) model--resembling an upper-convected Maxwell model with polarization stresses expressed through an electric field dyadic subject to upper-convected time derivatives. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of Kremer-Grest chains with charge sequences reveal distinct relaxation timescales for overall chain dynamics versus charge redistribution, manifested in shear and normal stress responses. Critically, upper-convected time derivatives of the electric field dyadic reproduce the viscosity scaling observed in both the Rouse and MD results; while standard continuum formulations without these terms fail to capture the scaling. Analysis of the dynamic rheological properties show that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field, in agreement with recent PMMA experiments.</description>

      <title>Identification of 2D colloidal assemblies in images: a threshold processing method versus machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 67%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review inadequacy of existing nematodynamic theories and suggest a novel way of establishing relations between nematic orientation and flow based on the \emph{local} symmetry between simultaneous rotation of nematic alignment and flow, which establishes energy exchange between the the two without reducing the problem to near-equilibrium conditions and invoking Onsager's relations. This approach, applied in the framework of the vector-based theory with a variable modulus, involves antisymmetric interactions between nematic alignment and flow and avoids spurious instabilities in the absence of an active inputs.</description>

      <title>A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how soft matter systems, including biological ones, can develop collective electromagnetic phenomena under external fields at ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold, followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton - proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse phenomena in hydrogen-bonded media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.</description>
