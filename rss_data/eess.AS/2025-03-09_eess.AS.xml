      <title>From Voice to Safety: Language AI Powered Pilot-ATC Communication Understanding for Airport Surface Movement Collision Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work integrates language AI-based voice communication understanding with collision risk assessment. The proposed framework consists of two major parts, (a) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR); (b) surface collision risk modeling. ASR module generates information tables by processing voice communication transcripts, which serve as references for producing potential taxi plans and calculating the surface movement collision risk. For ASR, we collect and annotate our own Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset based on open-sourced video recordings and safety investigation reports. Additionally, we refer to FAA Order JO 7110.65W and FAA Order JO 7340.2N to get the list of heuristic rules and phase contractions of communication between the pilot and the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo) used in daily aviation operations. Then, we propose the novel ATC Rule-Enhanced NER method, which integrates the heuristic rules into the model training and inference stages, resulting into hybrid rule-based NER model. We show the effectiveness of this hybrid approach by comparing different setups with different token-level embedding models. For the risk modeling, we adopt the node-link airport layout graph from NASA FACET and model the aircraft taxi speed at each link as a log-normal distribution and derive the total taxi time distribution. Then, we propose a spatiotemporal formulation of the risk probability of two aircraft moving across potential collision nodes during ground movement. We show the effectiveness of our approach by simulating two case studies, (a) the Henada airport runway collision accident happened in January 2024; (b) the KATL taxiway collision happened in September 2024. We show that, by understanding the pilot-ATC communication transcripts and analyzing surface movement patterns, the proposed model improves airport safety by providing risk assessment in time.</description>

      <title>Musical Source Separation of Brazilian Percussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musical source separation (MSS) has recently seen a big breakthrough in separating instruments from a mixture in the context of Western music, but research on non-Western instruments is still limited due to a lack of data. In this demo, we use an existing dataset of Brazilian sama percussion to create artificial mixtures for training a U-Net model to separate the surdo drum, a traditional instrument in samba. Despite limited training data, the model effectively isolates the surdo, given the drum's repetitive patterns and its characteristic low-pitched timbre. These results suggest that MSS systems can be successfully harnessed to work in more culturally-inclusive scenarios without the need of collecting extensive amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Direct Speech to Speech Translation: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech to speech translation (S2ST) is a transformative technology that bridges global communication gaps, enabling real time multilingual interactions in diplomacy, tourism, and international trade. Our review examines the evolution of S2ST, comparing traditional cascade models which rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text to speech (TTS) components with newer end to end and direct speech translation (DST) models that bypass intermediate text representations. While cascade models offer modularity and optimized components, they suffer from error propagation, increased latency, and loss of prosody. In contrast, direct S2ST models retain speaker identity, reduce latency, and improve translation naturalness by preserving vocal characteristics and prosody. However, they remain limited by data sparsity, high computational costs, and generalization challenges for low-resource languages. The current work critically evaluates these approaches, their tradeoffs, and future directions for improving real time multilingual communication.</description>

      <title>S2S-Arena, Evaluating Speech2Speech Protocols on Instruction Following with Paralinguistic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has brought significant attention to speech models, particularly recent progress in speech2speech protocols supporting speech input and output. However, the existing benchmarks adopt automatic text-based evaluators for evaluating the instruction following ability of these models lack consideration for paralinguistic information in both speech understanding and generation. To address these issues, we introduce S2S-Arena, a novel arena-style S2S benchmark that evaluates instruction-following capabilities with paralinguistic information in both speech-in and speech-out across real-world tasks. We design 154 samples that fused TTS and live recordings in four domains with 21 tasks and manually evaluate existing popular speech models in an arena-style manner. The experimental results show that: (1) in addition to the superior performance of GPT-4o, the speech model of cascaded ASR, LLM, and TTS outperforms the jointly trained model after text-speech alignment in speech2speech protocols; (2) considering paralinguistic information, the knowledgeability of the speech model mainly depends on the LLM backbone, and the multilingual support of that is limited by the speech module; (3) excellent speech models can already understand the paralinguistic information in speech input, but generating appropriate audio with paralinguistic information is still a challenge.</description>

      <title>UniArray: Unified Spectral-Spatial Modeling for Array-Geometry-Agnostic Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Array-geometry-agnostic speech separation (AGA-SS) aims to develop an effective separation method regardless of the microphone array geometry. Conventional methods rely on permutation-free operations, such as summation or attention mechanisms, to capture spatial information. However, these approaches often incur high computational costs or disrupt the effective use of spatial information during intra- and inter-channel interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose UniArray, a novel approach that abandons the conventional interleaving manner. UniArray consists of three key components: a virtual microphone estimation (VME) module, a feature extraction and fusion module, and a hierarchical dual-path separator. The VME ensures robust performance across arrays with varying channel numbers. The feature extraction and fusion module leverages a spectral feature extraction module and a spatial dictionary learning (SDL) module to extract and fuse frequency-bin-level features, allowing the separator to focus on using the fused features. The hierarchical dual-path separator models feature dependencies along the time and frequency axes while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that UniArray outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SI-SDRi, WB-PESQ, NB-PESQ, and STOI across both seen and unseen array geometries.</description>

      <title>DiVISe: Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis Preserving Speaker Characteristics And Intelligibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-speech (V2S) synthesis, the task of generating speech directly from silent video input, is inherently more challenging than other speech synthesis tasks due to the need to accurately reconstruct both speech content and speaker characteristics from visual cues alone. Recently, audio-visual pre-training has eliminated the need for additional acoustic hints in V2S, which previous methods often relied on to ensure training convergence. However, even with pre-training, existing methods continue to face challenges in achieving a balance between acoustic intelligibility and the preservation of speaker-specific characteristics. We analyzed this limitation and were motivated to introduce DiVISe (Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis), an end-to-end V2S model that predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from video frames alone. Despite not taking any acoustic hints, DiVISe effectively preserves speaker characteristics in the generated audio, and achieves superior performance on both objective and subjective metrics across the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that DiVISe not only outperforms existing V2S models in acoustic intelligibility but also scales more effectively with increased data and model parameters. Code and weights can be found at https://github.com/PussyCat0700/DiVISe.</description>

      <title>Self-Learning for Personalized Keyword Spotting on Ultra-Low-Power Audio Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a self-learning method to incrementally train (fine-tune) a personalized Keyword Spotting (KWS) model after the deployment on ultra-low power smart audio sensors. We address the fundamental problem of the absence of labeled training data by assigning pseudo-labels to the new recorded audio frames based on a similarity score with respect to few user recordings. By experimenting with multiple KWS models with a number of parameters up to 0.5M on two public datasets, we show an accuracy improvement of up to +19.2% and +16.0% vs. the initial models pretrained on a large set of generic keywords. The labeling task is demonstrated on a sensor system composed of a low-power microphone and an energy-efficient Microcontroller (MCU). By efficiently exploiting the heterogeneous processing engines of the MCU, the always-on labeling task runs in real-time with an average power cost of up to 8.2 mW. On the same platform, we estimate an energy cost for on-device training 10x lower than the labeling energy if sampling a new utterance every 6.1 s or 18.8 s with a DS-CNN-S or a DS-CNN-M model. Our empirical result paves the way to self-adaptive personalized KWS sensors at the extreme edge.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</description>

      <title>ConSinger: Efficient High-Fidelity Singing Voice Generation with Minimal Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is expected to generate high-fidelity singing voice from given music scores (lyrics, duration and pitch). Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality. Audio samples are available at https://keylxiao.github.io/consinger.</description>

      <title>Nexus-O: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human beings perceive the real world through a spectrum of sensory modalities, encompassing auditory, visual, and linguistic faculties. The journey towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates the development of models that can emulate these multifaceted perceptual capabilities and comprehensively understand these diversified data. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Nexus-O}, an industry-level \textbf{omni-perceptive and -interactive} model capable of efficiently processing Audio, Image, Video, and Text data in any combination and output audio/text in an end-to-end way. We systematically investigate Nexus-O by addressing three key research questions: First, how can models be efficiently designed and trained to achieve tri-modal alignment, understanding and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities? Second, what approaches can be implemented to evaluate tri-modal model robustness, ensuring reliable performance and applicability in real-world scenarios? Third, what strategies can be employed to curate and obtain high-quality, real-life scenario speech datasets? For the first question, we design and pre-train Nexus-O based on the vision-language model, rather than the language model. By pre-training the model over high-quality synthetic audio data, our model is capable of tri-modal perception and interaction. For the second question, we introduce a new audio testbed, Nexus-O-audio, comprising diverse Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) samples, spanning various real-world scenarios, such as corporate meetings and live stream. For the third question, we design the speech data synthesis pipeline to obtain high-quality speech training datasets, covering various real-world scenarios. Comprehensive experimentation and an in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment over latent space demonstrate the advantages of our model on downstream tasks.</description>
