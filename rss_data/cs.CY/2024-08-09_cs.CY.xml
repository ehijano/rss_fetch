      <title>Criticizing Ethics According to Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a critique of ethics in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). It argues for the need to question established patterns of thought and traditional authorities, including core concepts such as autonomy, morality, and ethics. These concepts are increasingly inadequate to deal with the complexities introduced by emerging AI and autonomous agents. This critique has several key components: clarifying conceptual ambiguities, honestly addressing epistemic issues, and thoroughly exploring fundamental normative problems. The ultimate goal is to reevaluate and possibly redefine some traditional ethical concepts to better address the challenges posed by AI.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Anthropomorphizing Large Language Models in Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in learning environments to support teaching-be it as learning companions or as tutors. With our contribution, we aim to discuss the implications of the anthropomorphization of LLMs in learning environments on educational theory to build a foundation for more effective learning outcomes and understand their emotional impact on learners. According to the media equation, people tend to respond to media in the same way as they would respond to another person. A study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology showed that chatbots can be successfully implemented in learning environments. In this study, learners in selected online courses were unable to distinguish the chatbot from a "real" teacher. As LLM-based chatbots such as OpenAI's GPT series are increasingly used in educational tools, it is important to understand how the attribution processes to LLM-based chatbots in terms of anthropomorphization affect learners' emotions.</description>

      <title>A Survey of AI Reliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become an indispensable component of modern technology. However, research on human behavioral responses is lagging behind, i.e., the research into human reliance on AI advice (AI reliance). Current shortcomings in the literature include the unclear influences on AI reliance, lack of external validity, conflicting approaches to measuring reliance, and disregard for a change in reliance over time. Promising avenues for future research include reliance on generative AI output and reliance in multi-user situations. In conclusion, we present a morphological box that serves as a guide for research on AI reliance.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Assessing Cumulative Exposure to Extreme Temperatures During Transit Trip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined influence of urban heat islands, climate change, and extreme temperature events are increasingly impacting transit travelers, especially vulnerable populations such as older adults, people with disabilities, and those with chronic diseases. Previous studies have generally attempted to address this issue at either the micro- or macro-level, but each approach presents different limitations in modeling the impacts on transit trips. Other research proposes a meso-level approach to address some of these gaps, but the use of additive exposure calculation and spatial shortest path routing poses constraints meso-modeling accuracy. This study introduces HeatPath Analyzer, a framework to assess the exposure of transit riders to extreme temperatures, using TransitSim 4.0 to generate second-by-second spatio-temporal trip trajectories, the traveler activity profiles, and thermal comfort levels along the entire journey. The approach uses heat stress combines the standards proposed by the NWS and CDC to estimate cumulative exposure for transit riders, with specific parameters tailored to the elderly and people with disabilities. The framework assesses the influence of extreme heat and winter chill. A case study in Atlanta, GA, reveals that 10.2% of trips on an average summer weekday in 2019 were at risk of extreme heat. The results uncover exposure disparities across different transit trip mode segments, and across mitigation-based and adaptation-based strategies. While the mitigation-based strategy highlights high-exposure segments such as long ingress and egress, adaptation should be prioritized toward the middle or second half of the trip when a traveler is waiting for transit or transferring between routes. A comparison between the traditional additive approach and the dynamic approach presented also shows significant disparities, which, if overlooked, can mislead policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Are Social Sentiments Inherent in LLMs? An Empirical Study on Extraction of Inter-demographic Sentiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are supposed to acquire unconscious human knowledge and feelings, such as social common sense and biases, by training models from large amounts of text. However, it is not clear how much the sentiments of specific social groups can be captured in various LLMs. In this study, we focus on social groups defined in terms of nationality, religion, and race/ethnicity, and validate the extent to which sentiments between social groups can be captured in and extracted from LLMs. Specifically, we input questions regarding sentiments from one group to another into LLMs, apply sentiment analysis to the responses, and compare the results with social surveys. The validation results using five representative LLMs showed higher correlations with relatively small p-values for nationalities and religions, whose number of data points were relatively large. This result indicates that the LLM responses including the inter-group sentiments align well with actual social survey results.</description>

      <title>Articulatory Configurations across Genders and Periods in French Radio and TV archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies changes in articulatory configurations across genders and periods using an inversion from acoustic to articulatory parameters. From a diachronic corpus based on French media archives spanning 60 years from 1955 to 2015, automatic transcription and forced alignment allowed extracting the central frame of each vowel. More than one million frames were obtained from over a thousand speakers across gender and age categories. Their formants were used from these vocalic frames to fit the parameters of Maeda's articulatory model. Evaluations of the quality of these processes are provided. We focus here on two parameters of Maeda's model linked to total vocal tract length: the relative position of the larynx (higher for females) and the lips protrusion (more protruded for males). Implications for voice quality across genders are discussed. The effect across periods seems gender independent; thus, the assertion that females lowered their pitch with time is not supported.</description>

      <title>A Note on Tesla's Revised Safety Report Crash Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between June 2018 and December 2022, Tesla released quarterly safety reports citing average miles between crashes for Tesla vehicles. Prior to March 2021, crash rates were categorized as 1) with their SAE Level 2 automated driving system Autopilot engaged, 2) without Autopilot but with active safety features such as automatic emergency braking, and 3) without Autopilot and without active safety features. In January 2022, Tesla revised past reports to reflect their new categories of with and without Autopilot engaged, in addition to making small adjustments based on recently discovered double counting of reports and excluding previously recorded crashes that did not meet their thresholds of airbag or active safety restraint activation. The revisions are heavily biased towards no-active-safety-features$\unicode{x2014}$a surprising result given prior research showing that drivers predominantly keep most active safety features enabled. As Tesla's safety reports represent the only national source of Level 2 advanced driver assistance system crash rates, clarification of their methods is essential for researchers and regulators. This note describes the changes and considers possible explanations for the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining the philosophical literature on statistical evidence and the interdisciplinary literature on algorithmic fairness, we revisit recent objections against classification parity in light of causal analyses of algorithmic fairness and the distinction between predictive and diagnostic evidence. We focus on trial proceedings as a black-box classification algorithm in which defendants are sorted into two groups by convicting or acquitting them. We defend a novel principle, causal equal protection, that combines classification parity with the causal approach. In the do-calculus, causal equal protection requires that individuals should not be subject to uneven risks of classification error because of their protected or socially salient characteristics. The explicit use of protected characteristics, however, may be required if it equalizes these risks.</description>

      <title>Insights from an experiment crowdsourcing data from thousands of US Amazon users: The importance of transparency, money, and data use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data generated by users on digital platforms are a crucial resource for advocates and researchers interested in uncovering digital inequities, auditing algorithms, and understanding human behavior. Yet data access is often restricted. How can researchers both effectively and ethically collect user data? This paper shares an innovative approach to crowdsourcing user data to collect otherwise inaccessible Amazon purchase histories, spanning 5 years, from more than 5000 US users. We developed a data collection tool that prioritizes participant consent and includes an experimental study design. The design allows us to study multiple aspects of privacy perception and data sharing behavior. Experiment results (N=6325) reveal both monetary incentives and transparency can significantly increase data sharing. Age, race, education, and gender also played a role, where female and less-educated participants were more likely to share. Our study design enables a unique empirical evaluation of the "privacy paradox", where users claim to value their privacy more than they do in practice. We set up both real and hypothetical data sharing scenarios and find measurable similarities and differences in share rates across these contexts. For example, increasing monetary incentives had a 6 times higher impact on share rates in real scenarios. In addition, we study participants' opinions on how data should be used by various third parties, again finding demographics have a significant impact. Notably, the majority of participants disapproved of government agencies using purchase data yet the majority approved of use by researchers. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role that transparency, incentive design, and user demographics play in ethical data collection practices, and provide guidance for future researchers seeking to crowdsource user generated data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How has generative AI impacted the experiences of college students? We study the influence of AI on the study habits, class choices, and career prospects of Harvard undergraduates (n=326), finding that almost 90% of students use generative AI. For roughly 25% of these students, AI has begun to substitute for attending office hours and completing required readings. Half of students are concerned that AI will negatively impact their job prospects, and over half of students wish that Harvard had more classes on the future impacts of AI. We also investigate students' outlook on the broader social implications of AI, finding that half of students are worried that AI will increase economic inequality, and 40% believe that extinction risk from AI should be treated as a global priority with the same urgency as pandemics and nuclear war. Around half of students who have taken a class on AI expect AI to exceed human capabilities on almost all tasks within 30 years. We make some recommendations to the Harvard community in light of these results.</description>

      <title>Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information does not significantly improve participants' ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. In contrast, viewing human-generated fact checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: it decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view LLM fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false headlines. Our findings highlight an important source of potential harm stemming from AI applications and underscore the critical need for policies to prevent or mitigate such unintended consequences.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Critical Thinking Tools: A Case Study of Philosophers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current work in language models (LMs) helps us speed up or even skip thinking by accelerating and automating cognitive work. But can LMs help us with critical thinking -- thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts? We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs. We find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap. Using the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. We hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other 'critical thinkers' to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs.</description>

      <title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</description>
