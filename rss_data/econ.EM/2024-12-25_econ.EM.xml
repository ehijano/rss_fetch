      <title>Conditional Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many nonparametric objects of interest that are a function of a conditional distribution. One important example is an average treatment effect conditional on a subset of covariates. Many of these objects have a conditional influence function that generalizes the classical influence function of a functional of a (unconditional) distribution. Conditional influence functions have important uses analogous to those of the classical influence function. They can be used to construct Neyman orthogonal estimating equations for conditional objects of interest that depend on high dimensional regressions. They can be used to formulate local policy effects and describe the effect of local misspecification on conditional objects of interest. We derive conditional influence functions for functionals of conditional means and other features of the conditional distribution of an outcome variable. We show how these can be used for locally linear estimation of conditional objects of interest. We give rate conditions for first step machine learners to have no effect on asymptotic distributions of locally linear estimators. We also give a general construction of Neyman orthogonal estimating equations for conditional objects of interest.</description>

      <title>Testing Sign Congruence Between Two Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the null hypothesis that two parameters $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ have the same sign, assuming that (asymptotically) normal estimators $(\hat{\mu}_1,\hat{\mu}_2)$ are available. Examples of this problem include the analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects, causal interpretation of reduced-form estimands, meta-studies, and mediation analysis. A number of tests were recently proposed. We recommend a test that is simple and rejects more often than many of these recent proposals. Like all other tests in the literature, it is conservative if the truth is near $(0,0)$ and therefore also biased. To clarify whether these features are avoidable, we also provide a test that is unbiased and has exact size control on the boundary of the null hypothesis, but which has counterintuitive properties and hence we do not recommend. We use the test to improve p-values in Kowlaksi (2022) from information contained in that paper's main text and to establish statistical significance of some key estimates in Dippel et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory for IV-Based Reinforcement Learning with Potential Endogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.04021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard data analysis framework, data is collected (once and for all), and then data analysis is carried out. However, with the advancement of digital technology, decision-makers constantly analyze past data and generate new data through their decisions. We model this as a Markov decision process and show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis leads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the endogeneity problem in standard data analysis. We propose a class of instrument variable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the bias and establish their theoretical properties by incorporating them into a stochastic approximation (SA) framework. Our analysis accommodates iterate-dependent Markovian structures and, therefore, can be used to study RL algorithms with policy improvement. We also provide formulas for inference on optimal policies of the IV-RL algorithms. These formulas highlight how intertemporal dependencies of the Markovian environment affect the inference.</description>
