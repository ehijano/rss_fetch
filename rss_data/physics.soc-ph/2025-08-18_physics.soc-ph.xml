      <title>The End of Hyperbolic Growth in Human Population and CO$_2$ Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using current empirical data from 10,000 BCE to 2023 CE, we re-examine a hyperbolic pattern of human population growth, which was identified by von Foerster et al. in 1960 with a predicted singularity in 2026. We find that human population initially grew exponentially in time as $N(t)\propto e^{t/T}$ with $T$=2080 years. This growth then gradually evolved to be super-exponential with a form similar to the Bose function in statistical physics. Around 1700, population growth further accelerated, entering the hyperbolic regime as $N(t)\propto(t_s-t)^{-1}$ with the extrapolated singularity year $t_s$=2030, which is close to the prediction by von Foerster et al. We attribute the switch from the super-exponential to the hyperbolic regime to the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the transition to massive use of fossil fuels. This claim is supported by a linear relation that we find between the increase in the atmospheric CO$_2$ level and population from 1700 to 2000. In the 21st century, we observe that the inverse population curve $1/N(t)$ deviates from a straight line and follows a pattern of "avoided crossing" described by the square root of the Lorentzian function. Thus, instead of a singularity, we predict a peak in human population at $t_s$=2030 of the time width $\tau$=32 years. We also find that the increase in CO$_2$ level since 1700 is well fitted by ${\rm arccot}[(t_s-t)/\tau_F]$ with $\tau_F$=40 years, which implies a peak in the annual CO$_2$ emissions at the same year $t_s$=2030.</description>

      <title>Vishap stelae as cult dedicated prehistoric monuments of Armenian Highlands: data analysis and interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vishaps, or dragon stones, are prehistoric stelae discovered in the high-altitude mountainous regions of modern-day Armenia and adjacent regions. The first statistical analysis of their elevation distribution and size reveals that their construction was intentionally labor-intensive rather than arbitrary. The findings support the hypothesis that vishaps were closely associated with an ancient water cult, as they are predominantly situated near water sources, including high-altitude springs and discovered prehistoric irrigation systems. Furthermore, the unexpected bimodal distribution of their altitudes suggests specific placement patterns, potentially linked to seasonal human activities or ritual practices. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the symbolic and functional significance of vishap stelae within the framework of prehistoric social and religious systems.</description>

      <title>Finding the Fairest Voting System using Likelihood Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper takes a statistical approach to determine which of 10 voting systems, or preference aggregation rules, is the fairest based on their probabilistic likelihood of violating Arrow's five social choice criteria. The voting systems considered are: Plurality, Borda, Dowdall, Top Two (Plurality Runoff), Instant Runoff, Coombs, Baldwin, Copeland, Pairwise Majority, and Minimax. This paper builds upon the work of Dougherty and Heckelman (2020) by computing violation frequencies for elections with a greater number of alternatives. Elections with up to 50,000 voters and between three and six alternatives are simulated using both Impartial Culture and Impartial Anonymous Culture. The results of these simulations produce new IIA violation likelihoods for each method and show that Pairwise Majority is the most likely to jointly satisfy all five of Arrow's criteria. Furthermore, of the systems that satisfy transitivity, the Baldwin method is most likely to jointly satisfy all five of Arrow's criteria in elections with three alternatives. As the number of alternatives increase, the joint satisfaction frequencies decrease rapidly for all systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Language in Observational Studies: Sociocultural Backgrounds and Team Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of causal language in observational studies has raised concerns about overstatement in scientific communication. While some argue that such language should be reserved for randomized controlled trials, others contend that rigorous causal inference methods can justify causal claims in observational research. Ideally, causal language should align with the strength of the underlying evidence. However, through the analysis of over 90,000 abstracts from observational studies using computational linguistic and regression methods, we found that causal language are more common in work by less experienced authors, smaller research teams, male last authors, and researchers from countries with higher uncertainty avoidance indices. Our findings suggest that the use of causal language is not solely driven by the strength of evidence, but also by the sociocultural backgrounds of authors and their team composition. This work provides a new perspective for understanding systematic variations in scientific communication and emphasizes the importance of recognizing these human factors when evaluating scientific claims.</description>

      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>
