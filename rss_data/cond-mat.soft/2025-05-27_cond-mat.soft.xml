      <title>Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</description>

      <title>Correlations, mean-field limits, and transition to the concentrated regime in motile particle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming particles exhibit complex collective behaviors driven by hydrodynamic interactions, showing persistent large-scale flows and long-range correlations. While heavily studied, it remains unclear how such structures depend on the system size and swimmer concentration. To address these issues, we simulate very large systems of suspended swimmers across a range of system sizes and volume fractions. For this we use high-performance simulation tools that build on slender body theory and implicit resolution of steric interactions. At low volume fractions and long times, the particle simulations reveal dynamic flow structures and correlation functions that scale with the system size. These results are consistent with a mean-field limit and agree well with a corresponding kinetic theory. At higher concentrations, the system departs from mean-field behavior. Flow structures become cellular, and correlation lengths scale with the particle size. Here, translational motion is suppressed, while rotational dynamics dominate. These findings highlight the limitations of dilute mean-field models and reveal new behaviors in dense active suspensions.</description>

      <title>Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ligand-mediated transitions in simple macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Poro-viscoelastic Wetting with Large Swelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deposition of droplets onto a swollen polymer network induces the formation of a wetting ridge at the contact line. Current models typically consider either viscoelastic effects or poroelastic effects, while polymeric gels often exhibit both properties. In this study, we investigate the growth of the wetting ridge using a comprehensive large deformation theory that integrates both dissipative mechanisms - viscoelasticity and poroelasticity. In the purely poroelastic case, following an initial instantaneous incompressible deformation, the growth dynamics exhibit scale-free behavior, independent of the elastocapillary length or system size. A boundary layer of solvent imbibition between the solid surface (in contact with the reservoir) and the region of minimal chemical potential is created. At later times, the ridge equilibrates on the diffusion timescale given by the elastocapillary length. When viscoelastic properties are incorporated, our findings show that, during the early stages (prior to the viscoelastic relaxation timescale), viscoelastic effects dominate the growth dynamics of the ridge and solvent transport is significantly suppressed. Beyond the relaxation time, the late-time dynamics closely resemble those of the purely poroelastic case. These findings are discussed in light of recent experiments, showing how our approach offers a new interpretation framework for wetting of polymer networks of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian sparse modeling for interpretable prediction of hydroxide ion conductivity in anion-conductive polymer membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anion-conductive polymer membranes have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for alkaline fuel cells and electrolysis cells. Their hydroxide ion conductivity varies depending on factors such as the type and distribution of quaternary ammonium groups, as well as the structure and connectivity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. In particular, the size and connectivity of hydrophilic domains significantly influence the mobility of hydroxide ions; however, this relationship has remained largely qualitative. In this study, we calculated the number of key constituent elements in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic units based on the copolymer composition, and investigated their relationship with hydroxide ion conductivity by using Bayesian sparse modeling. As a result, we successfully identified composition-derived features that are critical for accurately predicting hydroxide ion conductivity.</description>

      <title>Attraction-Induced Cluster Fragmentation and Local Alignment in Active Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically studied active Brownian particles with attractive interactions. Contrary to our intuition, the attractive force between particles disrupts the formation of a single cluster observed in motility-induced phase separation, giving rise to a multi-cluster state characterized by a power-law distribution of cluster sizes. Remarkably, the self-propulsion directions spontaneously align within each cluster, resulting in enhanced cluster motility despite the absence of alignment interactions. This study revealed the intricate role of attractive interactions in the aggregation of motile systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of self-propelled particles under cyclic stretching, inspired by the characteristic pattern dynamics observed in microtubule (MT) motility assays subjected to uniaxial cyclic substrate stretching. We develop a self-propelled particle model that incorporates the elastic energy acting on the filaments due to substrate deformation, successfully reproducing the experimentally observed MT patterns. Additionally, the general framework of the model enables systematic exploration of collective responses to various substrate deformations, offering potential applications in the manipulation of MT patterns and other active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Driven Probe Particle Dynamics in a Bubble Forming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine the dynamics of a probe particle driven at a constant force through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction that forms a bubble or stripe state. In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble, and in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity-force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in DNA Packing Density Drive the Spatial Segregation between Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the crowded eukaryotic nucleus, euchromatin and heterochromatin segregate into distinct compartments, a phenomenon often attributed to homotypic interactions mediated by liquid liquid phase separation of chromatin associated proteins. Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of active matter, cell division and cell aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these Lecture Notes we aim at clarifying how soft matter physics, and herein notably statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, can be engaged to understand and manipulate non-equilibrium systems consisting of numerous (microscopic) constituents that convert (chemical) energy to mechanical energy, or vice versa, and that are known as active matter. Hydrodynamic theory, vitally extended to include (anisotropic) active stress, provides an astonishingly successful scaffold for tackling the problem of spontaneous flow in active nematics, all the way to active turbulence. The laws of physics, nonchalantly tresspassing the border crossing between inanimate particle and living cell, are seen to perform cum laude in describing the bi-directional coupling between division and apoptosis on the one hand and mechanical stress on the other. Fluidization of cellular tissue by cell division is a conceptual leap in this arena. The active behavior of nematic tissues (cell extrusion, multilayer formation, ...) turns out to be controlled by topological defects in the orientational order. Playgrounds by excellence for exhibiting stress-growth coupling are multicellular spheroids serving as model tumors, and cysts used as stem cell factories for cell therapy. Finally, our study of villi and crypts in the intestine furnishes a synthesis of various concepts explored. Cell mechanical pressure and cell layer geometrical curvature turn out to provide the dynamical ingredients which, when coupled to the cell division rate, allow one to develop a physical theory of tissue morphology which hopefully will have practical impact on cancer research.</description>

      <title>Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase-separated interfaces shape the behavior of both passive and active condensates. While surface tension in equilibrium systems minimizes interface length, non-equilibrium fluxes can destabilize flat or constantly curved interfaces, giving rise to complex interface morphologies. Starting from a minimal model that couples a conserved, phase-separating species to a self-generated chemical field, we identify the conditions under which interfacial instabilities may emerge. Specifically, we show that non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions induce two distinct types of instabilities: a stationary (non-oscillatory) instability that promotes interface deformations, and an oscillatory instability that can give rise to persistent capillary waves propagating along the boundaries of phase-separated domains. To characterize these phenomena, we develop a perturbative framework that predicts the onset, wavelength, and velocity of capillary waves, and quantitatively validate these predictions through numerical simulations. Beyond the linear regime, our simulations reveal that capillary waves undergo a secondary instability, leading to either stationary or dynamically evolving superpositions of different wave modes. Finally, we investigate whether capillary waves can facilitate directed mass transport, either along phase boundaries (conveyor belts) or through self-sustained liquid gears crawling along a solid wall. Taken together, our results establish a general framework for interfacial dynamics in active phase-separating systems and suggest new strategies for controlling mass transport in soft matter and biological condensates.</description>

      <title>Biaxial characterization of soft elastomers: experiments and data-adaptive configurational forces for fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fracture mechanics of soft solids remains a fundamental challenge due to their complex, nonlinear responses under large deformations. While multiaxial loading is key to probing their mechanical behavior, the role of such loading in fracture processes is still poorly understood. Here, we present a combined experimental-computational framework to investigate fracture in soft elastomers under equi-biaxial loading. We report original equi-biaxial quasi-static experiments on five elastomeric materials, revealing a spectrum of material and fracture behavior, from brittle-like to highly deformable response with crack tip strains exceeding 150 %. Motivated by these observations, we develop a hybrid computational testbed that mirrors the experimental setup and enables virtual biaxial tests. Central to this framework are two components: a data-adaptive formulation of hyperelastic energy functions that flexibly captures material behavior, and a post-processing implementation of the Configurational Force Method, providing a computationally efficient estimate of the J-integral at the crack tip. Our data-adaptive framework for hyperelastic energy functions proves versatility to capture with high accuracy the hyperelastic behavior observed in the biaxial experiments. This is important because accurately capturing the constitutive behaviour of soft solids is key for a reliable application of the Configurational Force Method to soft solids. In the limit of crack onset, a critical value of the crack tip configurational force allows for a criterion of fracture toughness. Together, our experimental, theoretical, and computational contributions offer a new paradigm for characterizing and designing soft materials with tailored fracture properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective turns in starling flocks propagate linearly with negligible attenuation, indicating the existence of an underdamped sector in the dispersion relation. Beside granting linear propagation of the phase perturbations, the real part of the frequency should also yield a spin-wave form of the unperturbed correlation function. However, new high-resolution experiments on real flocks show that underdamped traveling waves coexist with an overdamped Lorentzian correlation. Theory and experiments are reconciled once we add to the dynamics a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou term.</description>

      <title>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Forces, Particle Rearrangements, and Macroscopic Stress Fluctuations in Sheared 2D Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that, during most large slip events, particles with the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, initially coalesce into one or two dominant connected clusters. These clusters coincide with the region exhibiting the greatest instantaneous reduction in inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within these clusters correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion was included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</description>

      <title>Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>
