      <title>Maximum Expected Reward Line If Non Specialist -- Law (for darts)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different levels of expertise in playing darts can be well described simply by the likeliness of a player to really hit the field he is aiming for. We characterise this ability by introducing a spread to hit the targeted field whose width scales inversely with the players skill and determine which field to aim for to find the highest expectation value for the score depending on the players' proficiency.</description>

      <title>Is Winter Coming?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically examine the often-made observation that "quantum winter [or some other winter] is coming", and the related admonition to prepare for this or that winter, inevitably bound to arrive. What we find based on even the most superficial look at the available evidence is that such statements not only are overblown hype, but are also factually wrong: Winter is here, and the real question is rather for how long it/they will stay.</description>

      <title>Unobserving the Moon: the spurious possibility of orbital decoupling due to solar neutrino Arago spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's wave nature of matter makes diffraction theory applicable for particles, such as neutrinos, as well. During a solar eclipse, some of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun are diffracted by the Moon, resulting in a diffraction pattern that can be observed on Earth. In this paper we consider the theoretically emerging solar neutrino Arago spot as a means to measure the location of the Moon with high accuracy and consider its implication on the orbit of the Moon given Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Our results indicate that the Moon is not at immediate risk of orbital decoupling due to the observation of a solar neutrino Arago spot.</description>

      <title>Species Syzygy: Which Animal Has Seen the Most Total Solar Eclipses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Total Solar Eclipse (TSE) is a shocking and sublime experience. In just a week hundreds of millions of Homo Sapiens will attempt to see the 2024 eclipse as it stretches across the North American continent. However, while Homo Sapiens may be uniquely positioned to understand and predict eclipses, they are not the only species capable of observing them. The precise alignment of the Moon, Earth and Sun all existed well before humans. In the same way we share this planet capable of hosting life, the fantastic astronomical experiences available on it are not exclusive either. We present a framework to calculate the number of Total Solar Eclipses experienced by a species at any point in Earth's history. This includes factoring in the evolution of the Sun-Moon-Earth system, the duration the species is extant, and average population. We normalize over the geographic range by calculating an Astronomical World Eclipse Surface cOverage MEtric (AWESOME) time. To illustrate this framework we look at the case study of the family Limulidae (Horseshoe Crabs) and estimate the number of individuals that have seen an eclipse. We compare it to the number of current Homo Sapiens that view eclipses, and predict if it is possible for another species to take the ''top'' spot before the final total solar eclipse in ~ 380 million years.</description>

      <title>Vulcan: Retreading a Tired Hypothesis with the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of planets in the solar system over the last three centuries has, perhaps surprisingly, been less of a fixed value than one would think it should be. In this paper, we look at the specific case of Vulcan, which was both a planet before Pluto was a planet and discarded from being a planet before Pluto was downgraded. We examine the historical context that led to its discovery in the 19th century, the decades of observations that were taken of it, and its eventual fall from glory. By applying a more modern understanding of astrophysics, we provide multiple mechanisms that may have changed the orbit of Vulcan sufficiently that it would have been outside the footprint of early 20th century searches for it. Finally, we discuss how the April 8, 2024 eclipse provides a renewed opportunity to rediscover this lost planet after more than a century of having been overlooked.</description>

      <title>I'm in AGNi: A new standard for AGN pluralisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new standard acronym for Active Galactic Nuclei, finally settling the argument of AGN vs. AGNs. Our new standard is not only etymologically superior (following the consensus set by SNe), but also boasts other linguistic opportunities, connecting strongly with relevant theology and streamlining descriptions of AGN properties.</description>
