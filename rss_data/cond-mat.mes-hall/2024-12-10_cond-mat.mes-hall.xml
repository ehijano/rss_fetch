      <title>Large enhancement of nonlinear optical response of graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions with multiple topological interface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear optical response of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions both without and with one or multiple topological interface states. By implementing a distant-neighbor quantum-mechanical (DNQM) method, we demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of GNR heterojunctions as the number of topological states at their interfaces increases. Specifically, we find that GNR heterojunctions with multiple topological interface states exhibit a notably stronger third-order nonlinear optical response in comparison with the similarly sized counterparts with a single topological interface state or without such states. Furthermore, we observe that the presence of topological interface states in GNR heterojunctions can induce a significant red-shift in their quantum plasmon frequency. Our results reveal the potential to enhance the nonlinear optical response at the nanoscale by increasing the number of topological interface states in graphene nanostructures or other topological systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in a metal-oxide memristive device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic resonance phenomenon has been studied experimentally and theoretically for a state-of-art metal-oxide memristive device based on yttria-stabilized zirconium dioxide and tantalum pentoxide, which exhibits bipolar filamentary resistive switching of anionic type. The effect of white Gaussian noise superimposed on the sub-threshold sinusoidal driving signal is analyzed through the time series statistics of the resistive switching parameters, the spectral response to a periodic perturbation and the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the nonlinear system. The stabilized resistive switching and the increased memristance response are revealed in the observed regularities at an optimal noise intensity corresponding to the stochastic resonance phenomenon and interpreted using a stochastic memristor model taking into account an external noise source added to the control voltage. The obtained results clearly show that noise and fluctuations can play a constructive role in nonlinear memristive systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A quantized anomalous Hall effect above 4.2 K in stacked topological insulator/magnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized anomalous Hall effects (QAHEs) occur in remarkable electronic states which possess not only quantized Hall signals but in some cases regions of dissipationless electron transport. The initial demonstrations of a QAHE in a magnetically-doped topological insulator (TI) required temperatures below 100 mK, and since then a major focus of the field has been to increase the temperature scale. Here, we report quantized Hall signals up to 10 K (in what is known as the parity anomaly state) in TI/magnet bilayers made by mechanical assembly, rather than by conventional deposition techniques. This is a factor of 100 higher temperature than any previous realization of a QAHE in a proximity-coupled TI/magnet heterostructure made by deposition, and approximately twice the previous record for any QAHE system.</description>

      <title>Effect of electric field on excitons in wide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.</description>

      <title>Compiling the surface code to crossbar spin qubit architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in quantum dots provide a promising platform for realizing large-scale quantum processors since they have a small characteristic size of a few tens of nanometers. One difficulty of controlling e.g., a few thousand qubits on a single chip is the large number of control lines. The crossbar control architecture has been proposed to reduce the number of control lines exploiting shared control among the qubits. Here, we compile the surface code cycle to a pulse sequence that can be executed in the crossbar architecture. We decompose the quantum circuits of the stabilizer measurements in terms of native gates of the spin-qubit architecture. We provide a routing and scheduling protocol, and construct a gate voltage pulse sequence for the stabilizer measurement cycle. During this protocol, coherent phase errors can occur on idle qubits, due to the operational constraints of the crossbar architecture. We characterize these crosstalk errors during the stabilizer measurement cycle, and identify an experimentally relevant parameter regime where the crosstalk errors are below the surface code threshold. Our results provide design guidelines for near-term qubit experiments with crossbar architectures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects in two-dimensional CrPS$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-layer CrPS$_{4}$ is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS$_{4}$ hosts a variety of anomalous Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Magnonics along the wall in Bimeron Chain Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that domain walls built from bimeron chains (bc-DW) in two-dimensional systems constitute a spontaneously assembled medium that holds magnonic excitations along its direction. We prove that such magnons are topological, leading to protected edge states. We also verify the stability of the domain walls and its edge modes' resilience against disorder. Analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations support our findings. The robustness of these edge modes holds promise for potential applications in the design of nanoscale magnonic devices for information storage and transport.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Non-Hermitian Spectral Topology in Hyperbolic Lattices with Non-Abelian Translation Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperbolic lattice (HBL) has emerged as a compelling platform for exploring matter in non-Euclidean space. Among its notable features, the breakdown of the conventional Bloch theorem stands out, prompting a reexamination of band theory, with the determination of spectra for non-Hermitian systems being a prominent example. Here, we develop an approach to determining the spectra under open boundary conditions (OBCs), one of the foundations in non-Hermitian lattices, from the reciprocal space of HBLs. By introducing supercells to encompass states that are allowed by non-Abelian translational groups, we perform analytic continuation and base on the point gap topology to acquire uniform spectra, the universal OBC spectral range. Applying this method to a single-band nonreciprocal model and a reciprocal non-Abelian semimetal model, we reveal higher-dimensional skin effects and topological phase transitions, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of our method in predicting spectral topology and investigating non-Hermitian physics in HBLs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electric Field Control of Magnetic Phase in Bilayer Magnets via interlayer hopping modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets present a promising platform for spintronic applications due to their unique structural and electronic properties. The ability to electrostatically control their interlayer magnetic coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases is particularly advantageous for the development of energy-efficient spintronic components. While effective in bilayer CrI3, achieving this control in other 2D magnets remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that bilayer Cr2Ge2Te6 can achieve efficient electrostatic control through interlayer hopping modulation. We show that an external electric field can effectively manipulate the FM-AFM phase transition when interlayer hopping is enhanced by pressure or sliding. We further develop a four-site interlayer hopping model, revealing that the phase transition is driven by a combined effect of on-site energy splitting and interlayer electronic hopping. These findings pave the way for designing novel, electrically tunable spintronic devices, offering substantial potential for energy-efficient information processing and storage.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Knots and Nonreciprocal Dynamics in non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two dimensions, Hermitian lattices with non-zero Chern numbers and non-Hermitian lattices with a higher-order skin effect (HOSE) bypass the constraints of the Nielsen-Ninomiya "no-go" theorem at their one-dimensional boundaries. This allows the realization of topologically protected one-dimensional edge states with nonreciprocal dynamics. However, unlike the edge states of Chern insulators, the nonreciprocal edges of HOSE phases exist only at certain edges of the two-dimensional lattice, not all, leading to corner-localized states. In this work, we investigate the topological connections between these two systems and uncover novel non-Hermitian topological phases possessing "higher-order topological knots" (HOTKs). These phases arise from multiband topology protected by crystalline symmetries and host point-gap-protected nonreciprocal edge states that circulate around the entire boundary of the two-dimensional lattice. We show that phase transitions typically separate HOTK phases from "Complex Chern insulator" phases --non-Hermitian lattices with nonzero Chern numbers protected by imaginary line gaps in the presence of time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Transport of Majorana Bound State in the presence of telegraph noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana Bound States (MBS) have emerged as promising candidates for robust quantum computing due to their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection. In this study, we focus on the dynamical transport of MBS in the semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructure via the piano key-type setup, wherein each of the keys of the wire can be tuned from topological to trivial phases. We focus on the transport of MBS under noisy conditions and evaluate the feasibility for realistic scenarios. The central emphasis of our work lies in using both numerical and analytical techniques to understand the effect of noise in inducing diabatic errors during transport and to establish scaling laws that relate these errors to the drive time. To achieve this, we derive an effective model that captures the scaling behavior in both noise-free and noisy scenarios, providing a unified framework for analyzing the transport dynamics. We investigate the optimal number of keys for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effects of disorder on transport dynamics, highlighting its impact on error scaling and robustness.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis-controlled Van der Waals tunneling infrared detector enabled by selective layer heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) photodetectors play a crucial role in various applications, including the development of biomimetic vision systems that emulate neuronal function. However, current mid-IR photodetector technologies are limited by their cost and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate a new type of photodetector based on a tunnel structure made of two-dimensional materials. The effect manifests when the upper and lower layers of the tunnel structure are heated differently. The photoswitching is threshold-based and represents a ``jump'' in voltage to another branch of the current-voltage characteristic when illuminated at a given current. This mechanism provides enormous photovoltage (0.05$-$1~V) even under weak illumination. Our photodetector has built-in nonlinearity and is therefore an ideal candidate for use in infrared vision neurons. Additionally, using this structure, we demonstrated the possibility of selective heating of layers in a van der Waals stack using mid-IR illumination. This method will allow the study of heat transfer processes between layers of van der Waals structures, opening new avenues in the physics of phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Slow interband recombination promotes an anomalous thermoelectric response of the $p-n$ junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric effects in $p-n$ junctions are widely used for energy generation with thermal gradients, creation of compact Peltier refrigerators and, most recently, for sensitive detection of infrared and terahertz radiation. It is conventionally assumed that electrons and holes creating thermoelectric current are in equilibrium and share the common quasi-Fermi level. We show that lack of interband equilibrium results in an anomalous sign and magnitude of thermoelectric voltage developed across the $p-n$ junction. The anomalies appear provided the diffusion length of minority carriers exceeds the size of hot spot at the junction. Normal magnitude of thermoelectric voltage is partly restored if interband tunneling at the junction is allowed. The predicted effects can be relevant to the cryogenically cooled photodetectors based on bilayer graphene and mercury cadmium telluride quantum wells.</description>

      <title>Moving Protocol of Majorana Corner Modes in a Superconducting 2D Weyl Semimetal Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Real-space study of zero-field correlation in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene (RG) has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Despite its potential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a detailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states. In this study, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe the intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a correlated insulating state with a 17 meV gap at the charge neutrality point in tetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer configuration. This gap is suppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge carrier density and does not exhibit inter-valley coherence patterns. We attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state, characterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and antiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic correlated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the correlated regime, a bound state emerges around a non-magnetic impurity but is absent near magnetic impurities, suggesting that non-magnetic doping induces a spin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated regime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of the band dispersion in tetralayer RG. These findings provide atomic-scale evidences of zero-field correlations in RG and may be extended to study other exotic phases in RG.</description>

      <title>Spin transport through a nanojunction with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin -- Gilbert damping and spin-transfer torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of this study is spin transport through an orbital belonging to a magnetic molecule, connected to two leads, and coupled via exchange interaction with the precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field. The expressions for spin current components, noise of $z$-polarized spin current, spin-transfer torque, Gilbert damping and other torque coefficients are obtained using the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions technique. The precession of the molecular spin, and hence, the inelastic tunnelling processes involving spin-flip events between molecular quasienergy levels, driven by this precession, can be controlled by the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter. By setting the Larmor precession frequency, the tilt angle of molecular magnetization with respect to the magnetic field, and the magnetic anisotropy parameter, one can modulate the spin-current components and noise, spin-transfer torque and related torque coefficients. Moreover, the dc-spin current and spin-transfer torque components provide the quasienergy level structure in the orbital and the torque vanishes for a suppressed molecular spin precession, obtained by proper adjustment of the anisotropy parameter and magnetic field, allowing to reveal the anisotropy parameter via a dc-spin current or torque measurement. The results of the study show that spin transport and spin-transfer torque generated on the anisotropic molecular spin can be manipulated by the uniaxial anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin even in the absence of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Crossover from Conventional to Unconventional Superconductivity in 2M-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging reciprocal-space proximity effect between superconducting bulk and topological surface states (TSSs) offers a promising way to topological superconductivity. However, elucidating the mutual influence of bulk and TSSs on topological superconductivity remains a challenge. Here, we report pioneering transport evidence of a thickness-dependent transition from conventional to unconventional superconductivity in 2M-phase WS2 (2M-WS2). As the sample thickness reduces, we see clear changes in key superconducting metrics, including critical temperature, critical current, and carrier density. Notably, while thick 2M-WS2 samples show conventional superconductivity, with an in-plane (IP) upper critical field constrained by the Pauli limit, samples under 20 nm exhibit a pronounced IP critical field enhancement, inversely correlated with 2D carrier density. This marks a distinct crossover to unconventional superconductivity with strong spin-orbit-parity coupling. Our findings underscore the crucial role of sample thickness in accessing topological states in 2D topological superconductors, offering pivotal insights into future studies of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>On the angular dependence of anomalous Hall current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse current (j_H) due to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is usually assumed to be perpendicular to the magnetization (m) in ferromagnetic materials, which governs the experiments in spintronics. Generally, this assumption is derived from a continuum model, where the crystal's discrete symmetry is effectively represented by the concept of an effective mass from the band structure. In this paper, we calculate the spin transport through the nonmagnetic metal (NM) | ferromagnetic metal (FM) interfaces and find that the corresponding Hall current is generally not perpendicular to m with only a few exceptions at high symmetry crystal orientations. The calculation illustrates the breakdown of j_H={\theta}m{\times}j_c, where {\theta} denotes the anomalous Hall angle and j_c represents the injecting charge current. An analytical formula based on the discrete symmetry of the solid can describe this effect well. In this framework, the leading order corresponds to the conventional AHE, while higher-order terms account for deviations in the Hall current. Additionally, we identify the presence of a chiral anomalous Hall effect (CAHE) at interface with odd rotational symmetry (e.g., C_{3v}) and the higher-order terms can even dominate the AHE by constructing superlattices. The general existence of hidden chirality in spin transport is also revealed, with a specific focus on interface chirality (IC). Our results highlight the significance of discrete atomic positions in solids for spin transport, which extends beyond the conventional continuum model. Moreover, considering the important application of the AHE in spintronics and the wide existence of the interfaces in the devices, the breakdown of j_H={\theta}m{\times}j_c suggests that all experimental measurements related to the AHE should be re-evaluated.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Switching in Monolayer 2D Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors via Spin-to- Spin Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with topological insulators or heavy metals holds great potential for realizing next-generation spintronic memory devices. However, achieving high-efficiency SOT switching of monolayer vdW magnets at room temperature poses a significant challenge, particularly without an external magnetic field. Here, we show field-free, deterministic, and nonvolatile SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization in the monolayer, diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Fe-doped MoS2(Fe:MoS2) at up to 380 K with a current density of $7\times10^4 A cm^{-2}$. The in situ doping of Fe into monolayer MoS2 via chemical vapor deposition and the geometry-induced strain in the crystal break the rotational switching symmetry in Fe:MoS2, promoting field-free SOT switching by generating out-of-plane spins via spin-to-spin conversion. An apparent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) loop shift at a zero in-plane magnetic field verifies the existence of z spins in Fe:MoS2, inducing an antidamping-like torque that facilitates field-free SOT switching. A strong topological Hall effect (THE) was also observed, attributed to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), reducing the energy barrier for SOT switching. This field-free SOT application using a 2D ferromagnetic monolayer provides a new pathway for developing highly power-efficient spintronic memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the tight-binding model of graphite, incorporating all Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure parameters, we compute the spectrum of two-dimensional states of electrons bound to a stacking fault in Bernal graphite. We find that those bands retain characteristic features of the low-energy bands of a rhombohedral graphene trilayer, which actually represents the lattice structure the fault. Based on the self-consistent analysis of charge and potential distribution across the fault layers, we determine the shape of the Fermi contour for the 2D band, which has the form of three pockets with a hole-like conic dispersion and Dirac points above the Fermi level. The computed frequency of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the cyclotron mass of the fault-bound charge carriers (at the Fermi level) are sufficiently different from the corresponding bulk values in graphite, making such stacking faults identifiable by quantum transport and cyclotron resonance measurements.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate transport affected by cavity-mediated electron hopping in multi-terminal quantum Hall bars, quantum point contacts, and Aharonov-Bohm interferometers. Beyond determining conductances and resistances, we analyze spatially resolved current distributions and local density of states. Our study reveals how cavity-mediated inter-edge scattering impacts quantum magnetotransport in finite-size systems and how the cavity-mediated hopping significantly alters electron quantum interference effects.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the symmetry of photon-dressed electronic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interaction provides opportunities for tailoring the physical properties of quantum materials on the ultrafast timescale by forming photon-dressed electronic states, i.e., Floquet-Bloch states. While the light field can in principle imprint its symmetry properties onto the photon-dressed electronic states, so far, how to experimentally detect and further engineer the symmetry of photon-dressed electronic states remains elusive. Here by utilizing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with polarization-dependent study, we directly visualize the parity symmetry of Floquet-Bloch states in black phosphorus. The photon-dressed sideband exhibits opposite photoemission intensity to the valence band at the $\Gamma$ point,suggesting a switch of the parity induced by the light field. Moreover, a "hot spot" with strong intensity confined near $\Gamma$ is observed, indicating a momentum-dependent modulation beyond the parity switch. Combining with theoretical calculations, we reveal the light-induced engineering of the wave function of the Floquet-Bloch states as a result of the hybridization between the conduction and valence bands with opposite parities, and show that the "hot spot" is intrinsically dictated by the symmetry properties of black phosphorus. Our work suggests TrARPES as a direct probe for the parity of the photon-dressed electronic states with energy- and momentum-resolved information, providing an example for engineering the wave function and symmetry of such photon-dressed electronic states via Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast glide-mirror symmetry breaking in black phosphorus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays an important role in fields of physics, ranging from particle physics to condensed matter physics. In solid-state materials, phase transitions are deeply linked to the underlying symmetry breakings, resulting in a rich variety of emergent phases. Such symmetry breakings are often induced by controlling the chemical composition and temperature or applying an electric field and strain, etc. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrafast glide-mirror symmetry breaking in black phosphorus through Floquet engineering. Upon near-resonance pumping, a light-induced full gap opening is observed at the glide-mirror symmetry protected nodal ring, suggesting light-induced breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry. Moreover, the full gap is observed only in the presence of the light-field and disappears almost instantaneously ($\ll$100 fs) when the light-field is turned off, suggesting the ultrafast manipulation of the symmetry and its Floquet engineering origin. This work not only demonstrates light-matter interaction as an effective way to realize ultrafast symmetry breaking in solid-state materials, but also moves forward towards the long-sought Floquet topological phases.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a nanofabricated photonic crystal made from the magnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: Specialty integrated chips for power intensive tasks like artificial intelligence generate so much heat that data centers are switching to liquid cooling to prevent malfunction. A critical factor hindering optimization of the thermal flux across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface is the lack of any predictive model for the thermal slip length at non-cryogenic temperatures. An extensive study using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveals distinct power law relations governing this length scale which incorporate the influence of local temperature, in-plane translational order and vibrational frequency of the liquid contact layer and adjoining solid layer. Similar relations are expected to hold for other L/S systems modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential given the principle of corresponding states.</description>

      <title>Exotic properties and manipulation in 2D semimetal Mn2B2(OH)2: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most functional materials possess one single outstanding property and are limited to be used for a particular purpose. Instead of integrating materials with different functions into one module, designing materials with controllable multi-functions is more promising for the electronic industry. In this study, we investigate an unexplored alpha-phase of two-dimensional (2D) Mn2B2(OH)2 theoretically. Eighteen distinct electrical polarizations, characterized by three different magnitudes and twelve different directions, are found in this phase. The switch of the electrical polarizations is also linked to an observed splitting of band structures between different spin states and the ferroelasticity of the system. The manipulation of these properties can be realized through controlling the alignment of Mn-OH-Mn chains. Additionally, the approximately honeycomb lattice for the atomic layer of boron indicate the potential superconductivity in the system. The diverse and tunable properties make the proposed material as an outstanding candidate for sensing applications at the 2D limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a transmon qubit and its dispersively coupled readout resonator to measure the Fock state populations of another microwave resonator, to which we have attached a quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR). First, we apply noise generated at room temperature to the resonator and show that such noise drive leads to a thermal distribution of the resonator Fock states. Subsequently, we detune the noise frequency band far away from the resonance condition and vary the power of the noise applied on the QCR. We observe that such artificial thermal noise may lead to major damping of a coherent state of the resonator. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the effective temperature of a thermal resonator state can be reduced from roughly 300 mK to 130 mK by the introduction of the artificial thermal noise. These observations pave the way for a purely thermally powered quantum-circuit refrigerator which may unlock the use of waste heat in resetting superconducting qubits in a quantum processor and in building autonomous quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Decoupling Drives Gold-Assisted Exfoliation of Large-Area Monolayer 2D Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gold assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique, producing centimeter scale single crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS2 on Au as a model system, we employ ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer, is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. We establish the strain-induced decoupling effect as the primary mechanism of GAE, which could also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric interlayer exchange coupling spontaneously built in synthetic antiferromagnetic structure by film growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antisymmetric-type long-range exchange interaction between two ferromagnetic layers through a nonmagnetic layer, called antisymmetric interlayer exchange coupling (AIEC), has recently been discovered and attracted much attention. This paper reports that the AIEC is naturally built in synthetic antiferromagnets depending on the thin film growth condition. For the synthetic antiferromagnets consisting of Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt layers, two kinds of film growth parameters are examined: the effects of epitaxial growth and oblique incident of sputter-deposition. The present results indicate that the spatial fluctuations in thicknesses are one of the major sources inducing the AIEC while the epitaxial growth, which leads to the sharp interfaces and the uniformity in layer thicknesses, effectively suppresses the unexpected AIEC. In addition, the oblique sputter-deposition provides the large AIEC and the anisotropic distribution of AIEC direction in the case of textured films. The findings in this study provide key factors for designing the AIEC and is useful to develop emerging computing technologies with artificial three-dimensional topological magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Resistance switch in ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet spin valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. To date, existing research in literature has predominantly focused on the most stable 1H phase 2D MXs and their armchair edge NRs, since the zigzag edge NRs (ZNRs) of this phase show metallic behavior. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the localized state, the unpassivated case possesses a nearly flat top valence band. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

      <title>Reduction in Thermal Conductivity of Monolayer MoS2 by Large Mechanical Strains for Efficient Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) have received extensive research interests and investigations in the past decade. In this research, we report the first experimental measurement of the in plane thermal conductivity of MoS2 monolayer under a large mechanical strain using optothermal Raman technique. This measurement technique is direct without additional processing to the material, and MoS2's absorption coefficient is discovered during the measurement process to further increase this technique's precision. Tunable uniaxial tensile strains are applied on the MoS2 monolayer by stretching a flexible substrate it sits on. Experimental results demonstrate that, the thermal conductivity is substantially suppressed by tensile strains: under the tensile strain of 6.3%, the thermal conductivity of the MoS2 monolayer drops approximately by 62%. A serious of thermal transport properties at a group of mechanical strains are also reported, presenting a strain dependent trend. It is the first and original study of 2D materials' thermal transport properties under a large mechanical strain, and provides important information that the thermal transport of MoS2 will significantly decrease at a large mechanical strain. This finding provides the key information for flexible and wearable electronics thermal management and designs.</description>

      <title>Layer Dependent Thermal Transport Properties of One- to Three-Layer Magnetic Fe:MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-Dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been the subject of extensive attention thanks to their unique properties and atomically thin structure. Because of its unprecedented room-temperature magnetic properties, iron-doped MoS2 (Fe:MoS2) is considered the next-generation quantum and magnetic material. It is essential to understand Fe:MoS2's thermal behavior since temperature and thermal load/activation are crucial for their magnetic properties and the current nano and quantum devices have been severely limited by thermal management. In this work, Fe:MoS2 is synthesized by doping Fe atoms into MoS2 using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis and a refined version of opto-thermal Raman technique is used to study the thermal transport properties of Fe:MoS2 in the forms of single (1L), bilayer (2L), and tri-layer (3L). In the Opto-thermal Raman technique, a laser is focused on the center of a thin film and used to measure the peak position of a Raman-active mode. The lateral thermal conductivity of 1-3L of Fe:MoS2 and the interfacial thermal conductance between Fe:MoS2 and the substrate were obtained by analyzing the temperature-dependent and power-dependent Raman measurement, laser power absorption coefficient, and laser spot sizes. We also characterized Fe:MoS2's thermal transport at high temperature, and calculated Fe:MoS2's thermal transport by density theory function. These findings will shed light on the thermal management and thermoelectric designs for Fe:MoS2 based nano and quantum electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Polaronic dressing of bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a hybrid structure of a ferromagnetic-insulator and a superconductor connected by a weak link, which accommodates Andreev bound states whose spin degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange interaction with the ferromagnet. The resultant spin-resolved energy levels realize a two-state quantum system, provided that a single electron is trapped in the bound state, i.e., an Andreev spin qubit. The qubit state can be manipulated by controlling the magnetization dynamics of the ferromagnet, which mediates the coupling between external fields and the qubit. In particular, our hybrid structure provides a simple platform to manipulate and control the spin qubit using spintronic techniques. By employing a modified Hahn spin echo protocol for the magnetization dynamics, we show that our Andreev spin qubit can realize a nonadiabatic geometric gate.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Time-Reversal-Odd Nonlinear Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nonlinear current response has been theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed recently. However, the role of disorder scattering in the response, especially whether it contributes to the $\sigma_{xx}$-independent term, has not been clarified. In this work, we derive a general scaling law for this effect, which accounts for multiple scattering sources. We show that the nonlinear conductivity is generally a quartic function in $\sigma_{xx}$. Besides intrinsic contribution, extrinsic contributions from scattering also enter the zeroth order term, and their values can be comparable to or even larger than the intrinsic one. Terms beyond zeroth order are all extrinsic. Cubic and quartic terms must involve skew scattering and they signal competition between at least two scattering sources. The behavior of zeroth order extrinsic terms is explicitly demonstrated in a Dirac model. Our finding reveals the significant role of disorder scattering in $\mathcal{T}$-odd nonlinear transport, and establishes a foundation for analyzing experimental result.</description>

Abstract: We study interaction-mediated magnetism on the surface of ABC-multilayer graphene driven by its zero-energy topological flat bands. Using the random-phase approximation we treat onsite Hubbard repulsion and find multiple competing magnetic states, due to both intra- and inter-valley scattering, with the latter causing an enlarged magnetic unit cell. At half-filling and when the Hubbard repulsion is weak, we observe two different ferromagnetic orders. Once the Hubbard repulsion becomes more realistic, new ferrimagnetic orders arise with distinct incommensurate intra- or inter-valley scattering vectors depending on interaction strength and doping, leading to a multitude of competing magnetic states.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor-magnet heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space, the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we highlight the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy of high-frequency quantum circuits with a Josephson emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken metallic orders in spin-orbit-coupled Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, short-range Hund's coupling, and proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling using self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations. We show that the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase diagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via doping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley coherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding spin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also investigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines are used for probabilistic learning and are capable of capturing complex dependencies in data. They are employed for diverse purposes such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning and can be used for representing and analyzing physical systems with minimal data. In this paper, we investigate a complex, strongly correlated magnetic spin system with multiple metastable states (magnetic artificial spin ice) using a restricted Boltzmann machine. Magnetic artificial spin ice is of interest because degeneracies can be specified leading to complex states that support unusual collective dynamics. We investigate two distinct geometries exhibiting different low-temperature orderings to evaluate the machine's performance and adaptability in capturing diverse magnetic behaviors. Data sets constructed with spin configurations importance-sampled from the partition function of square and pinwheel artificial spin ice Hamiltonians at different temperatures are used to extract features of distributions using a restricted Boltzmann machine. Results indicate that the restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm is sensitive to features that define the artificial spin ice configuration space and is able to reproduce the thermodynamic quantities of the system away from criticality - a feature useful for faster sample generation. Additionally, we demonstrate how the restricted Boltzmann machine can distinguish between different artificial spin ice geometries in data even when structural defects are present.</description>

Abstract: Kondo physics and heavy-fermion behavior have been predicted and observed in moir\'e materials. The electric tunability of moir\'e materials allows an in-situ study of Kondo lattices' phase diagrams, which is not possible with their intermetallic counterparts. However, moir\'e platforms rely on twisting, which introduces twisting angle disorder and undesired buckling. Here we propose device layouts for one- and two-dimensional gate-defined superlattices in Bernal bilayer graphene where localized states couple to dispersive valley-helical modes. We show that, under electronic interactions, these superlattices are described by an electrically tunable Kondo-Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in nonchiral Rice-Mele model with bond disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rice-Mele model consists of a one-dimensional lattice with two sublattice sites in each unit cell subjected to a staggered sublattice potential. The onsite potential constitutes a mass term that breaks chiral symmetry. In this paper, we show that a topological phase transition is induced in this model by disordering intracell and intercell hopping energies unequally. For small enough mass, the phase transition is accompanied by anomalous localization, which is accounted for in terms of geometric means of random variables. Anomalous localization is insusceptible to mass. In contrast, the critical disorder strength at which the phase transition takes place decreases as mass increases, and eventually becomes invariable for large enough mass. For large enough mass, we show that the phase transition is characterized by arithmetic means instead of geometric means.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin friction and dissipative spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of local magnetic moments exchange coupled to a metallic system of conduction electrons is subject to dissipative friction even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Phenomenologically, this is usually described by a local Gilbert damping constant. Here, we use both linear response theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction microscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic structure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a one-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained from LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the microscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality, while the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for a few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion of nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation times. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the nonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on an expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal tight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in case of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are studied within the random-phase approximation. For the Hubbard model at half filling and with increasing interaction strength, we find a strong enhancement of the nonlocality of spin friction.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological Anderson insulator in a HgTe-based semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of Anderson localization in two-dimensional (2D) electrons and holes in the bulk of HgTe quantum wells with a semimetallic spectrum and under strong disorder. In contrast, the one-dimensional (1D) edge channels, arising from the spectrum's inversion, demonstrate remarkable robustness against disorder due to topological protection. Strong disorder induces a mobility gap in the bulk, enabling access to the 1D edge states and thereby realizing the two-dimensional topological Anderson insulator (TAI) state. Nonlocal transport measurements confirm the emergence of topologically protected edge channels. The TAI state appears to be very sensitive to an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample. Firstly, a small magnetic field of 30mT breaks the topological protection of 1D edge channels, thus turning the system into an ordinary Anderson insulator. Secondly, the magnetic field of 0.5T delocalizes 2D bulk electrons, transforming the system into a quantum Hall liquid.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics. This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Additionally, we compute the layer-resolved Floquet Hall conductivity and demonstrate that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be controlled via high-frequency laser pumping.</description>

Abstract: High spin Chern-number insulators (HSCI) have emerged as a novel 2D topological phase of condensed matter that is beyond the classification of topological quantum chemistry. In this work, we report the observation of a semimetallic Sb monolayer carrying the same band topology as HSCI with a spin Chern number equal to 2. Our calculations further indicate a moderate lattice strain can make Sb monolayer an insulator or a semimetal with a tunable spin Chern number from 0 to 3. The results suggest strained Sb monolayers as a promising platform for exploring exotic properties of the HSCI topological matter.</description>

      <title>The Bosonic Quantum Breakdown Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic quantum breakdown Hubbard model, which generalizes the Bose-Hubbard model by adding an asymmetric breakdown interaction turning one boson into two between adjacent sites. When the normal hopping is zero, this model has a global exponential U(1) symmetry, and we show that the ground state undergoes a first-order phase transition from Mott insulator (MI) to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) breakdown condensate as the breakdown interaction increases. Surprisingly, the SSB breakdown condensate does not have a gapless Goldstone mode, which invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem and leads to stable SSB in 1D. Moreover, we show that the quench dynamics of a boson added to MI exhibits a dynamical transition from dielectric to breakdown phases, which happens at a larger breakdown interaction than the ground state phase transition. Between these two transitions, the MI (dielectric) state is a false vacuum stable against dynamical breakdown. Our results reveal that quantum models with unconventional symmetries like the exponential symmetry can exhibit unexpected properties.</description>

      <title>Tunable Generation of Spatial Entanglement in Nonlinear Waveguide Arrays</title>

Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of path-entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in semiconductor nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

Abstract: Quantum materials with stacked van der Waals (vdW) layers hosting non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Using high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). We show that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-atomic-layer slabs separated by two I layers can accommodate a variety of metal atoms giving arise to topologically non-trivial features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and likely an additional strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers hosting or near quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kekul\'e lattice is an exotic, distorted lattice structure exhibiting alternating bond lengths, distinguished from naturally formed atomic crystals. Despite its evident applicability, the formation of a Kekul\'e lattice from topological solitons in magnetic systems has remained elusive. Here, we propose twisted bilayer easy-plane N\'eel antiferromagnets as a promising platform for achieving a "Meron Kekul\'e lattice"--a distorted topological soliton lattice comprised of antiferromagnetic merons as its lattice elements. We demonstrate that the cores of these merons are stabilized into the Kekul\'e-O pattern with different intracell and intercell bond lengths across moir\'e supercells, thereby forming a Meron Kekul\'e lattice. Moreover, the two bond lengths of the Meron Kekul\'e lattice can be fine-tuned by adjusting the twist angle and specifics of the interlayer exchange coupling, suggesting extensive control over the meron lattice configuration in contrast to conventional magnetic systems. These discoveries pave the way for exploring topological solitons with distinctive Kekul\'e attributes.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <title>Heat current and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a monitor under continuous measurement and feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce heat exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state heat current as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the heat current fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electric circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.</description>

Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of band edges and two-dimensional hole gases towards quantum Hall effect in altermagnetic CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate through first-principles calculations rutile CoF$_2$ as an altermagnetic material. It is confirmed that there are two antiparallel magnetic moments of Co ions in the unit cell and the magnetic easy axis is in the z axis. A giant nonrelativstic spin splitting is observed near the valence band edge (valence band maximum) and there are ideal flat bands at the valence band edge along the [110] directions in the Brillouin zone. The giant nonrelativstic spin splitting and the band-edge flat bands are both robust against the spin-orbits coupling. More importantly, these band-edge flat bands can induce two-dimensional hole gases in two different planes. Applying a magnetic field in the xy plane, there will appear Landau levels and quantum Hall effects can be achieved for both of the spin channels. When the magnetic field is along the diagonal directions, quantum Hall effects can be induced for one spin and there is a longitudinal conductivity for the other spin.</description>
