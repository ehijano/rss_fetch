      <title>On the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in the limit of integer spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilson-Fisher fixed point defines a continuous family of interacting conformal field theories in non-integer dimensions. In integer dimensions, it is widely believed to lie in the same universality class as the critical Ising model. In this work, we revisit the identification between the Wilson-Fisher fixed point at integer dimensions and the Ising CFT. We argue that a literal equality between the two theories is incompatible with the emergence of Virasoro symmetry in two dimensions. Instead, we propose that the Ising model emerges only as a subsector of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We support this scenario through a detailed study of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ model and by examining operators transforming in irreducible representations of the orthogonal group whose multiplicities become negative for integer values of the spacetime dimension. Finally, we comment on the implications of these results for attempts to construct a $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion starting from exact two-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Exploring the holographic entropy cone via reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to study the holographic entropy cone. Given a target entropy vector, our algorithm searches for a graph realization whose min-cut entropies match the target vector. If the target vector does not admit such a graph realization, it must lie outside the cone, in which case the algorithm finds a graph whose corresponding entropy vector most nearly approximates the target and allows us to probe the location of the facets. For the $\sf N=3$ cone, we confirm that our algorithm successfully rediscovers monogamy of mutual information beginning with a target vector outside the holographic entropy cone. We then apply the algorithm to the $\sf N=6$ cone, analyzing the 6 "mystery" extreme rays of the subadditivity cone from arXiv:2412.15364 that satisfy all known holographic entropy inequalities yet lacked graph realizations. We found realizations for 3 of them, proving they are genuine extreme rays of the holographic entropy cone, while providing evidence that the remaining 3 are not realizable, implying unknown holographic inequalities exist for $\sf N=6$.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Signatures of Ergodicity and Spectral Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate timelike entanglement measures derived from the spacetime density kernel in the Rosenzweig-Porter model and show that they sharply diagnose both eigenvector ergodicity and spectral chaos. For several Hilbert-space bipartitions, we compute the second Tsallis entropy, the entanglement imagitivity that quantifies non-Hermiticity, and Schatten-norm diagnostics of the kernel. The imagitivity and Frobenius norm exhibit rapid growth and high late-time plateaus in the ergodic regime, are suppressed in the localized regime, and show intermediate behavior in the fractal phase. The real part of the second Tsallis entropy displays a spectral form factor-like dip-ramp-plateau throughout the chaotic window and a suppressed ramp in the localized regime. We further introduce a kernel negativity, defined as the negative spectral weight of the Hermitian part of the kernel. This negativity equals the trace-norm distance to the set of positive semidefinite operators and the maximal witnessable negative quasiprobability, and its time-averaged value decreases across the ergodic-fractal-localized crossover in close correspondence with the fractal dimension.</description>

      <title>Twisting Twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct twisted noncommutative gauge theories on twistor space and show that they are equivalent to four-dimensional twist-noncommutative gauge theories. In particular, we study twists of the Poincar\'e algebra. We explain how such a twist leads to twisted noncommutative twistor space and how to construct noncommutative versions of BF theory and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on noncommutative supertwistor space. We show how those theories are equivalent to noncommutative versions of Yang-Mills theory and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, respectively.</description>

      <title>The homological algebra of 2d integrable field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a detailed and rigorous study of $4d$ semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theories and their associated $2d$ integrable field theories from the homological perspective of $L_\infty$-algebras. Through the use of homotopy transfer techniques, it is shown precisely how both the integrable field theory and its corresponding Lax connection emerge from the $4d$ theory, which results in a novel perspective on Lax connections in terms of $L_\infty$-morphisms.</description>

      <title>Averages of Exponentials from the point of view of Superintegrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate Gaussian averages of arbitrary exponentials of the matrix variable $X$ with the help of superintegrability, which provides explicit expressions for Schur averages. As in the simpler cases the answer is expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials, but in a somewhat sophisticated way. It involves triangular sum over partitions, with simple exponential factor and a complicated polynomial prefactor. Some ingredients of the formula are not found in full generality and there is still a room for further work.</description>

      <title>Gluon knots as the dynamical core of baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conjectural picture of baryon structure in which gluon knots, a type of topologically nontrivial configuration of color--magnetic monopole condensates, forms the dynamical core of the baryon. Within this framework, quarks interact with the gluon knot via abelian-dominated color-electric fields, which are squeezed into flux tubes by the dual Meissner effect, leading naturally to quark confinement. The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Topological defects and scalar field modes in cosmological backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological defects with a general structure in higher-dimensional cosmological backgrounds described by a set of angle deficit parameters. As special cases, they include higher-dimensional generalizations of cosmic strings and global monopoles. The corresponding complete set of mode functions is presented for a massive scalar field with a general curvature coupling parameter. For general scale factors and radial functions in the line element, the angular parts of the scalar modes are expressed in terms of associated Legendre functions. De Sitter and Milne universes are considered as examples of cosmological expansion. For the de Sitter bulk, we present the time-dependent parts of the mode functions in inflationary, hyperbolic, and global coordinates.</description>

      <title>Tidal perturbations and Love Symmetry for five-dimensional charged rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of general five-dimensional (5D) black holes of STU supergravity, which include as special cases important solutions such as the Myers-Perry, BMPV, 5D Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr-Newman and dyonic black holes. Solutions are parameterized by their mass, two angular momenta and up to three $U(1)$ charges. Love numbers and dissipation coefficients are obtained in the static and dynamic cases. In the latter scenario, we find new, nontrivial conditions, realized in important limiting cases of the theory, such as the BPS limit, where frequency-independent vanishing conditions are obtained. We also develop a ladder formalism for static solutions and derive the conserved charges. To the best of our knowledge, this formalism had not been previously derived for 5D black holes, including neutral ones. Finally, we show the emergence of Love symmetry in the near-zone regime, and derive the generators of the associated $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. It is shown that all conditions for Love-number vanishing can be explained by this algebra in terms of the highest-weight property.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition at weak coupling in two-color matrix QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g&gt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|\epsilon|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast&gt; g_1^\ast&gt;g_2^\ast&gt; \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Induced UV Completion of an $O(N)$ Scalar Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultraviolet completion of an $O(N)$ scalar field theory non-minimally coupled to gravity using the Wilsonian functional renormalization group in the proper-time formulation. Focusing on the spontaneously broken phase, we study the RG flow of the scalar potential and the non-minimal curvature coupling expanded around a running minimum. We identify two distinct classes of fixed-point solutions, one of which is ultraviolet attractive and characterized by a vanishing quartic coupling together with finite, interacting gravitational couplings. For a finite region of infrared initial conditions, the RG trajectories remain regular at all scales and approach this fixed point. This mechanism renders the theory asymptotically safe and leads to a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet. We show that this mechanism is robust under changes of cutoff scheme and truncation, allowing the ultraviolet completion requirement to constrain the infrared values of the scalar couplings and the mass scale in the broken phase.</description>

      <title>FORM Version 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FORM 5, a major release of the symbolic-manipulation system FORM. Version 5 introduces an integrated diagram generator, based on the GRACE graph-generator, to produce Feynman diagrams directly from FORM scripts. This release also adds support for arbitrary precision floating point coefficients, together with statements for the numerical evaluation of common mathematical functions as well as multiple zeta values and Euler sums. In addition, FORM 5 provides an interface to the FLINT library, offering substantially faster polynomial arithmetic. Various further functions and commands have been added alongside these major features, as well as performance improvements for TFORM and improved compression of FORM's temporary files. Compatibility with the previous release, FORM 4.3.1, is retained except where prior behaviour contradicted the manual or was experimental.</description>

      <title>G\"{o}del-symmetric backgrounds and explicit spacetime symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry with nondynamical background fields in gravitational theories can lead to inconsistencies between the equations of motion and the underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the St\"{u}ckelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the G\"{o}del metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Branch structure and nonextensive thermodynamics of Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black holes: observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $\zeta=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology.</description>

      <title>General Scalar Field Inflation ACT Attractors: Utilizing the $n_s(r)$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ACT data have severely constrained the single scalar field models. Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2\sigma$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\alpha r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=\gamma \pm \beta r \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.</description>

      <title>A Remedy of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with Smooth Slow-roll to Power-law Inflation Transitions in Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that if the standard slow-roll inflation is followed by a power-law inflationary regime, then the trans-Planckian modes may be safely be contained in the Hubble horizon and never exit it during inflation. In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\dot{\phi}^2=\beta(\phi)V(\phi)$, where $\beta(\phi)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feasibility of studying, numerically, properties of infinite volume QCD-like theories in the large $N$ limit using coherent state variational methods is reassessed. An entirely new implementation of this approach is described, applicable to SU($N$) lattice gauge theories, with or without fundamental representation fermions, on cubic lattices of up to four dimensions. In addition to various test cases, initial results are presented for Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory on an infinite two-dimensional spatial lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in the criticality of open quantum many-body systems, we study nonlinear sigma models with complexified couplings as a general framework for nonunitary field theory. Applying the perturbative renormalization-group analysis to the tenfold symmetric spaces, we demonstrate that fixed points with complex scaling dimensions and critical exponents arise generically, without counterparts in conventional nonlinear sigma models with real couplings. We further clarify the global phase diagrams in the complex-coupling plane and identify both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. Our work elucidates universal aspects of critical phenomena in complexified field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology as a Hydrogen atom: Discrete $\Lambda$ and cyclic Universes from Wheeler-DeWitt quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($\Lambda &lt; 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $\Lambda$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $\Lambda$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality in photon-graviton conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) is a temporal analogue of Bell's inequality and provides a quantitative test of the nonclassicality of a system through its violation. We analytically investigate the violation of the LGI in the context of photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field background, motivated by its potential applications to testing the nonclassicality of gravity. When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistency as a Reliability Test for Complex Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising tool to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>Pathology of the Unified Dark Sectors in Modified General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detection via photon-graviton scattering and quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully quantum field-theoretic framework for gravitational wave (GW) detection in which the interaction is described as photon-graviton scattering. In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit.</description>

      <title>Detector's response to coherent Rindler and Minkowski photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that the transition probability in a static two-level quantum detector interacting with a coherent Rindler photon is different from the same of the Rindler detector which is in interaction with a coherent Minkowski photon. Situation does not change in the response of quantum detector for the classical limit of the photon state. This we investigate in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$-spacetime dimensions. Interestingly, the transition probabilities of the ``classical'' detector in the classical limit of the photon state in $(1+1)$-dimensions, for these two scenarios, appear to be identical when the frequencies of photon mode and detector are taken to be same. However, our obtained detector's transition probabilities in $(3+1)$-dimensions, which are calculated under the large acceleration condition, do not show such signature. The implications of these observations are discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a nonperturbative formulation of strong-field QED developed in our earlier works, we consider photon emission accompanying vacuum instability under the action of a quasi-constant strong electric field of finite duration T. We construct closed formulas for the total probabilities and study the photon emission accompanying an electron-positron pair creation from a vacuum. We establish the domain of the applicability of the locally constant field approximation (LCFA) for the photon emission. We study angular and polarization distribution of the emission as well as emission characteristics in a high-frequency approximations with respect of 1/T. The results presented in this work is suitable to a further development of the LCFA proposed in [Phys. Rev. D 95, 076013 (2017)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator at the resonant (equal-frequency) point, where the dynamics becomes non-diagonalisable and the conventional Fock-space construction collapses. At the classical level, the degenerate system admits more than one Hamiltonian formulation generating the same equations of motion, leading to a nontrivial quantisation ambiguity. Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.
  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator provides a concrete example in which classically equivalent Hamiltonians define inequivalent quantum theories.</description>

The result holds for a wide variety of target categories (or $(\infty,n)$-categories) and arbitrary tangential structures. An appendix contains results on the mapping class groups of (stably-) framed manifolds that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov transformation, we compute the teleportation fidelity and examine its dependence on the expansion rate, initial entanglement, and the mode frequency. Our findings indicate that spacetime curvature and the underlying cosmological background significantly affect the efficiency of quantum teleportation, particularly through mode mixing and vacuum structure. We also compare our results with the flat Minkowski case to highlight the role of cosmic expansion in degrading or preserving quantum information.</description>

Abstract: This work considers a variation of the massive ambitwistor string model presented in arXiv:2301.11227 that describes supergravity and super-Yang-Mills on the Coulomb branch simultaneously with a single Lagrangian. All-multiplicity tree and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated and shown to have proper unitary factorization. The massless limit provides Einstein Yang-Mills Amplitudes including multiple gluon traces. It is argued that the cosmological constant vanishes at all orders of perturbation theory. As application, results for Compton scattering are obtained and compared with ones in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we consider effective field theories for light fields transforming under the fundamental or adjoint representation of a continuous group. We demonstrate that in the presence of gravity, crossing symmetry combined with two subtraction sum rules, leads to stringent constraints on the spectrum of its ultraviolet (UV) completion. Such constraints come in the form of necessary conditions on the symmetry group irreps of the UV states. This is in sharp contrast with non-gravitational theories where anything goes. Beautifully, the graviton pole is the anchor of our argument, not an obstruction. Using numerical methods, we also demonstrate that the massless spin-2 must be a singlet under said symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</description>

      <title>S-duality in higher-derivative corrections of heterotic supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the consistency of heterotic supergravity under T-duality when the $B$-field gauge transformation is rendered anomalous by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We demonstrate that T-duality invariance mandates an infinite tower of higher-derivative couplings, all scaling as $e^{-2\Phi}$. Within this tower, the couplings at orders $\alpha'$ and $\alpha'^2$ are protected from quantum corrections, making them exact and therefore amenable to analysis under the S-duality between heterotic and type I string theory. Our results confirm that the standard S-duality map itself does not receive higher-derivative modifications. Leveraging this exact correspondence, we derive the explicit form of the type I effective action at order $\alpha'$ in a scheme that omits dilaton derivatives.</description>

Abstract: This article continues previous work done in arXiv:2406.01907. It is shown in more detail how vacuum partition functions and the cosmological constant vanish at all orders of perturbation theory. Further, all-multiplicity higher-loop amplitudes are given and shown to be modular invariant, to have proper factorization, and to be UV-finite at least up to one-loop level, formally even to all levels. Therefore, the model provides a modular invariant and unitary N=8 supergravity theory in twistor space with embedded Super-Yang-Mills and promising UV-finiteness behavior.</description>

      <title>String islands, discrete theta angles and the 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ string landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete classification of the landscape of 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ string vacua remains an open problem. In this work we prove a classification theorem for 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ asymmetric orbifolds utilizing a correspondence with orbifolds of chiral 2D SCFTs with $c= 24$ (or $c= 12$). Interestingly, this class of theories can give rise to 6D vacua in which the only massless degrees of freedom reside in the gravity multiplet, with no moduli other than the dilaton, thus corresponding to truly isolated vacua, called string islands. It is expected that there exist five new type II islands with as-yet-unknown constructions. In this work we construct them all using asymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_n$-orbifolds of Type II on $T^4$ with $n = 5,8,10,12$. We show that the cases $n = 5,8$ admit non-trivial discrete theta angles which have important consequences for both the string and particle charge lattices. In fact they provide examples of BPS-incompleteness and the strongest failure of the lattice weak gravity conjecture. Our work is expected to finalize our understanding of all perturbative 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ theories.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reduce the Taub-NUT metric dimensionally to three spatial dimensions by treating time as an extra curled dimension, and end up with the 3-dimensional Einstein field equations plus a corresponding Maxwell type equations for a gravitomagnetic field, associated with the NUT charge, which also acts as a source for the Einstein field equations. In this approach, the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (1 + 3)-dimensional analogue of the (1 + 4)-dimensional metric of the Kaluza- Klein theory. Hence, in four dimensions, it unifies gravitation and gravitomagnetism, associated with the NUT charge, in the same footing that the Kaluza-Klein theory unifies gravitation and electromagnetism in five dimensions. In fact, in this way, gravity and gravitomagnetism, associated with the NUT charge, appear as two distinct fields that emerge from the temporal dimensional reduction. We also introduce a relation between the 4-dimensional gravitational constant and the NUT charge.</description>

Abstract: We systematically classify all supersymmetry-preserving mass deformations of SYM matrix models in all dimensions (D = 3, 4, 6, 10). In D = 10, the polarized IKKT model emerges as the only possible deformation. In D = 4, we identify two massive models without a sign problem, making them attractive candidates for non-perturbative numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the global symmetry structure of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models with Wess-Zumino term. When the target space has a compact isometry without fixed points, the theory has a pair of (group-like) global symmetries and many such theories also have non-invertible symmetries. We describe how the topology of the target space and Wess-Zumino term determine whether the group-like symmetries are continuous or discrete, and study their pure and mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We also revisit the construction of the non-invertible symmetries, which are associated with possible self-dualities under discrete gauging, and show how the global symmetry structure is left invariant by this gauging.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of framing in a family of 1/24 BPS Wilson loops in ABJ(M) theory, which define flows between 1/6 BPS and the 1/2 BPS superconformal fixed points. We analyze in perturbation theory how framing affects both the expectation values of these operators and the correlation functions of local insertions on the defect, as well as its interplay with RG flow and the g-theorem. We obtain a non-trivial identity between the one-point function of the defect stress tensor and a Q-exact correlator, which establishes a direct link between scale invariance, superconformal invariance and framing, and clarifies the deep connection between scale and cohomological anomalies. Finally, we propose a holographic interpretation of framing at strong coupling, identifying it with a coupling to the background B-field in the dual string theory.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) represent a novel construction of arbitrary field theories, including those of conformal fields, through the specification of the network architecture and prior distribution for the network parameters. In this work, we present a formalism for the construction of conformally invariant defects in these NN-FTs. We demonstrate this new formalism in two toy models of NN scalar field theories. We develop an NN interpretation of an expansion akin to the defect OPE in two-point correlation functions in these models.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel approach to the one-loop effective action for nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a heat kernel method to compute the one-loop effective action for a general class of nonlinear electrodynamic (NLED) theories in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Working in the background field formalism, we extract the logarithmically divergent part of the effective action, the so-called induced action, corresponding to the DeWitt $a_2$ coefficient of the heat kernel. In NLED, quantisation yields non-minimal differential operators, for which standard heat kernel techniques are not immediately applicable. Considering the weak-field regime, we calculate the $a_0$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions to leading order in the background electromagnetic field strength. Finally, we consider conformal NLED theories and compute the $a_0$ contribution to all orders. For this class, we comment on the role of causality being necessary and sufficient for the convergence of the exact $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions.</description>

      <title>The modular properties of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ torus $1$-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself.
  Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\mathsf{S}$ and $\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces and breather dynamics of analytic solutions in Heisenberg exchange-free chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic supercriticality and complex phase diagram for the AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the application of the Lee-Yang phase transition theorem to the realm of AdS black hole thermodynamics, thereby deriving a comprehensive complex phase diagram for such systems. Our research augments extant studies on black hole thermodynamic phase diagrams, particularly in the regime above the critical point, by delineating the Widom line of AdS black holes. This boundary segregates the supercritical domain of the phase diagram into two disparate zones. As the system traverses the thermodynamic crossover within the supercritical region, it undergoes a transition from one supercritical phase to another, while maintaining the continuity of its thermodynamic state functions. This behavior is fundamentally different from that below the critical point, where crossing the coexistence line results in discontinuities of thermodynamic state functions. The Widom line enables a thermodynamic crossover between single-phase states without traversing the spinodal that emerges in the critical region.</description>

      <title>Twisting inflation to sub-Planckian axion decay constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudoscalar inflation in the Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (first-order) formulation of gravity while allowing for torsion. We introduce two non-minimal interactions in the gravitational sector: pseudoscalar couplings to the Pontryagin density (Chern-Simons term) and the Nieh-Yan topological invariant. In the presence of these terms, the rolling pseudoscalar sources non-trivial torsional fields during inflation. We show that pathological gradient and ghost instabilities limit the strength of the coupling to the Pontryagin density during inflation. Furthermore, we show that the interaction with the Nieh-Yan term induces a new contribution to the pseudoscalar kinetic term, which parametrically increases its decay constant and allows for inflation on steep potentials. The torsion field generated by the background is parity violating, which is manifest in the resulting chiral gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the scalar sector is largely unaffected beyond the remapping of the axion decay constant to a larger value. Consequently, we show that while natural inflation with a cosine potential remains inconsistent with observations, the squared quartic hilltop potential can be made consistent with Planck 2018 data even for sub-Planckian decay constants by coupling to the Nieh-Yan term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of horizonless compact objects within astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</description>

      <title>Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie--Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that, depending on the geometry and quark ordering, the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system may be a hadronic molecule, a tetraquark state, or a superposition of the two. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau with a sharp transition to slow roll. We focus on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries for tidal Love numbers: Generalities and applications to analog black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers characterize the conservative, static response of compact objects to external tidal fields. Remarkably, these quantities vanish identically for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. This behavior has been attributed to hidden symmetries -- both geometric and algebraic -- governing perturbations in these space-times. Interestingly, a similar vanishing of selected multipolar Love numbers arises in the context of supersonic acoustic flows. These systems share several key features with black holes in general relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations. In this work, we explore a symmetry-based connection between the two frameworks and demonstrate that the ladder symmetries observed in acoustic black holes can be traced to structural properties of the underlying wave equation, mirroring those found in general relativistic black hole space-times.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement of Anyonic Charges and Emergent Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.</description>

Abstract: We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.
  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</description>
