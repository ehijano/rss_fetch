      <title>dnaGrinder: a lightweight and high-capacity genomic foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2. Furthermore, dnaGrinder is designed for easy fine-tuning on workstation-grade GPUs, accommodating input lengths exceeding 17,000 tokens. On a single high-performance GPU, it supports sequences longer than 140,000 tokens, making it a highly efficient and accessible tool for both basic biological research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Objectively Evaluating the Reliability of Cell Type Annotation Using LLM-Based Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability in cell type annotation is challenging in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis because both expert-driven and automated methods can be biased or constrained by their training data, especially for novel or rare cell types. Although large language models (LLMs) are useful, our evaluation found that only a few matched expert annotations due to biased data sources and inflexible training inputs. To overcome these limitations, we developed the LICT (Large language model-based Identifier for Cell Types) software package using a multi-model fusion and "talk-to-machine" strategy. Tested across various single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, our approach significantly improved annotation reliability, especially in datasets with low cellular heterogeneity. Notably, we established objective criteria to assess annotation reliability using the "talk-to-machine" approach, which addresses discrepancies between our annotations and expert ones, enabling reliable evaluation even without reference data. This strategy enhances annotation credibility and sets the stage for advancing future LLM-based cell type annotation methods.</description>
