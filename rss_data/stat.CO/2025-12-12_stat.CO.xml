      <title>The Interplay of Statistics and Noisy Optimization: Learning Linear Predictors with Random Data Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with randomly weighted data points in a linear regression model, under a generic weighting distribution. This includes various forms of stochastic gradient descent, importance sampling, but also extends to weighting distributions with arbitrary continuous values, thereby providing a unified framework to analyze the impact of various kinds of noise on the training trajectory. We characterize the implicit regularization induced through the random weighting, connect it with weighted linear regression, and derive non-asymptotic bounds for convergence in first and second moments. Leveraging geometric moment contraction, we also investigate the stationary distribution induced by the added noise. Based on these results, we discuss how specific choices of weighting distribution influence both the underlying optimization problem and statistical properties of the resulting estimator, as well as some examples for which weightings that lead to fast convergence cause bad statistical performance.</description>

      <title>Time-Averaged Drift Approximations are Inconsistent for Inference in Drift Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drift diffusion models (DDMs) have found widespread use in computational neuroscience and other fields. They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary. Furthermore, we conduct numerical examples with an attentional DDM (aDDM) to show that the use of TADA systematically misestimates the effect of attention in decision making.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Two-Sample Mean Test for High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-sample Bayesian mean test based on the Bayes factor with non-informative priors, specifically designed for scenarios where $p$ grows with $n$ with a linear rate $p/n \to c_1 \in (0, \infty)$. We establish the asymptotic normality of the test statistic and the asymptotic power. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed test performs competitively, particularly when the diagonal elements have heterogeneous variances and for small sample sizes. Furthermore, our test remains robust under distribution misspecification. The proposed method not only effectively detects both sparse and non-sparse differences in mean vectors but also maintains a well-controlled type I error rate, even in small-sample scenarios. We also demonstrate the performance of our proposed test using the \texttt{SRBCTs} dataset.</description>

      <title>Beyond Basic A/B testing: Improving Statistical Efficiency for Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we (i) show the statistical efficiency of using estimating equation and U statistics, which can address these issues separately; and (ii) propose a novel doubly robust generalized U that allows flexible definition of treatment effect, and can handles small samples, distribution robustness, ROI and confounding consideration in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotics and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies, apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests at a large SaaS company, and share results and learnings that are broadly useful.</description>
