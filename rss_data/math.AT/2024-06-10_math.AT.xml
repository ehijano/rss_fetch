      <title>Tangent spaces of diffeological spaces and their variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several methods have been proposed to define tangent spaces for diffeological spaces. Among them, the internal tangent functor is obtained as the left Kan extension of the tangent functor for manifolds. However, the right Kan extension of the same functor has not been well-studied. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between this right Kan extension and the external tangent space, another type of tangent space for diffeological spaces. We prove that by slightly modifying the inclusion functor used in the right Kan extension, we obtain a right tangent space functor, which is almost isomorphic to the external tangent space. Furthermore, we show that when a diffeological space satisfies a favorable property called smoothly regular, this right tangent space coincides with the right Kan extension mentioned earlier.</description>

      <title>The Macias topology on integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, a recent topology on the positive integers, generated by the collection of relatively prime positive integers, is generalized over integral domains. Some of its topological properties are studied. Properties of this topology on infinite principal ideal domains that are not fields are also explored, and a new topological proof of the infinitude of prime elements is obtained (assuming the set of units is finite), different from those presented in the style of H. Furstenberg. Finally, some problems are proposed.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Complex Score-based Diffusion Modelling through Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph structures offer a versatile framework for representing diverse patterns in nature and complex systems, applicable across domains like molecular chemistry, social networks, and transportation systems. While diffusion models have excelled in generating various objects, generating graphs remains challenging. This thesis explores the potential of score-based generative models in generating such objects through a modelization as combinatorial complexes, which are powerful topological structures that encompass higher-order relationships.
  In this thesis, we propose a unified framework by employing stochastic differential equations. We not only generalize the generation of complex objects such as graphs and hypergraphs, but we also unify existing generative modelling approaches such as Score Matching with Langevin dynamics and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This innovation overcomes limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on graph generation, opening up new possibilities in generative AI.
  The experiment results showed that our framework could generate these complex objects, and could also compete against state-of-the-art approaches for mere graph and molecule generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of persistence modules: metric stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan types are a family of discrete isomorphism invariants for representations of finite quivers. Previously (arXiv:2303.16075), we evaluated their discriminating power in the context of persistence modules over a finite poset, including multiparameter persistence modules (over a finite grid). In particular, we introduced the skyscraper invariant and proved it was strictly finer than the rank invariant. In order to study the stability of the skyscraper invariant, we extend its definition from the finite to the infinite setting and consider multiparameter persistence modules over $\mathbb Z ^n$ and $\mathbb R^n$. We then establish an erosion-type stability result for this version of the skyscraper invariant.</description>

      <title>Even-periodic cohomology theories for twisted parametrized spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recall the notion of twisted parametrized spectra defined by Douglas and provide a sufficient condition for an $\infty$-category of twisted parametrized module spectra to be untwisted over an even-periodic $E_2$-ring. It is an easy consequence of the universal property of Thom spectra. We also investigate a genuine equivariant generalization based on the theory of $\infty$-categories internal to the $\infty$-topos of $G$-spaces for a compact Lie group $G$. We expect that our sufficient condition is satisfied in a number of gauge theoretic settings. This article is intended as a warm-up for a generalization of certain Seiberg-Witten Floer stable homotopy theory, which we look forward to.</description>
