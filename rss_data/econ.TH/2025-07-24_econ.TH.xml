      <title>Revealed and Concealed Repression: Measurement, Deterrence, and Backlash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regimes routinely conceal acts of repression. We show that observed repression may be negatively correlated with total repression -- which includes both revealed and concealed acts -- across time and space. This distortion implies that policy interventions aimed at reducing repression by incentivizing regimes can produce perverse effects. It also poses challenges for research evaluating the efficacy of repression -- its deterrent and backlash effects. To address this, we develop a model in which regimes choose both whether to repress and whether to conceal repression. We leverage equilibrium relationships to propose a method for recovering concealed repression using observable data. We then provide an informational theory of deterrence and backlash effects, identifying the conditions under which each arises and intensifies. Finally, we show that comparing protest probabilities in the presence and absence of repression provides an upper bound on the size of the backlash effect, overstating its magnitude and thereby underestimating the efficacy of repression.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibrated Signaling in Digital Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital advertising, online platforms allocate ad impressions through real-time auctions, where advertisers typically rely on autobidding agents to optimize bids on their behalf. Unlike traditional auctions for physical goods, the value of an ad impression is uncertain and depends on the unknown click-through rate (CTR). While platforms can estimate CTRs more accurately using proprietary machine learning algorithms, these estimates/algorithms remain opaque to advertisers. This information asymmetry naturally raises the following questions: how can platforms disclose information in a way that is both credible and revenue-optimal? We address these questions through calibrated signaling, where each prior-free bidder receives a private signal that truthfully reflects the conditional expected CTR of the ad impression. Such signals are trustworthy and allow bidders to form unbiased value estimates, even without access to the platform's internal algorithms.
  We study the design of platform-optimal calibrated signaling in the context of second-price auction. Our first main result fully characterizes the structure of the optimal calibrated signaling, which can also be computed efficiently. We show that this signaling can extract the full surplus -- or even exceed it -- depending on a specific market condition. Our second main result is an FPTAS for computing an approximately optimal calibrated signaling that satisfies an IR condition. Our main technical contributions are: a reformulation of the platform's problem as a two-stage optimization problem that involves optimal transport subject to calibration feasibility constraints on the bidders' marginal bid distributions; and a novel correlation plan that constructs the optimal distribution over second-highest bids.</description>

      <title>Green Transition with Dynamic Social Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a green transition policy involving a tax on brown goods in an economy where preferences for green consumption consist of a constant intrinsic individual component and an evolving social component. We analyse equilibrium dynamics when social preferences exert a positive externality in green consumption, creating complementarity between policy and preferences. The results show that accounting for this externality allows for a lower tax rate compared to policy ignoring the social norm effects. Furthermore, stability conditions permit gradual tax reductions or even removal along the transition path, minimising welfare losses. Thus, incorporating policy-preference interactions improves green transition policy design.</description>

      <title>Divide or Confer: Aggregating Information without Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine receiver-optimal mechanisms for aggregating information that is divided across many biased senders. Each sender privately observes an unconditionally independent signal about an unknown state, so no sender can verify another's report. A receiver has a binary accept/reject decision which determines players' payoffs via the state. When information is divided across a small population and bias is low, the receiver-optimal mechanism coincides with the sender-preferred allocation, and can be implemented by letting senders \emph{confer} privately before reporting. However, for larger populations, we can benefit from the informational divide. We introduce a novel \emph{incentive-compatibility-in-the-large (ICL)} approach to solve the high-dimensional mechanism design problem for the large-population limit. We use this to show that optimal mechanisms converge to one that depends only on the accept payoff and punishes excessive consensus in the direction of the common bias. These surplus burning punishments imply payoffs are bounded away from the first-best level.</description>

      <title>Stochastically Structured Reservoir Computers for Financial and Economic System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The proposed framework leverages structure-preserving embeddings and graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics with enhanced interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme ensures that the learned models satisfy both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a dynamic behavioral model of resource competition among agents, and regional inflation network dynamics, illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing and anticipating complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in scenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and development, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or losing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget constraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget constraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget constraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information framework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive characterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with asymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the unconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings highlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies, providing new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and practical applications of all-pay auctions.</description>

      <title>The Learning Approach to Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified framework for a more detailed exploration of games. In existing literature, strategies of players are typically assigned scalar values, and the concept of Nash equilibrium is used to identify compatible strategies. However, this approach lacks the internal structure of a player, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors.
  To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of players and brings the focus to the challenge of learning that players face. Unlike Markov decision processes, which formalize control problems but not agent design, our framework subsumes standard reinforcement learning structures. It thus offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for such generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in the most basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler designs or compatibility analysis alone.
  In the discrete setting, we consider a player whose structure incorporates standard estimates from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we examine connections to reinforcement learning and bandit problems, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework.</description>
