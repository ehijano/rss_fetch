      <title>Investigating the Timing Behavior of Compton Scattering in BGO for Time-of-Flight PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth germanate (BGO) is gaining renewed attention as a viable material for hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detectors. While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.</description>

      <title>Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effective Segregation Coefficient in High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) Crystals for Ge Detector Development in Rare-Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of rare-event physics experiments depend on large-volume, detector-grade high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals with precise control of impurity segregation during growth. We report a detailed study of impurity distribution in a single Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal produced at University of South Dakota (USD). The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions. These findings inform process-optimization strategies for HPGe crystal pulling, improve impurity control along the boule, and support the reliable fabrication of large, low-background HPGe detectors for next-generation rare-event searches.</description>

      <title>A Hands-On Workshop for Constructing a Low-Field MRI System in Three Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging system assembly knowledge can be expanded by leveraging open-source hardware and software, simplified installation requirements, and collaborative training initiatives. To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction. The constructed scanner represents a valuable platform for educational initiatives, pulse sequence development, and preclinical research imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply lessons from fast timing detector R$\&amp;$D to strategies for initial calibration of large timing arrays at future colliders. Detector R$\&amp;$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a broadband Photon Detection Efficiency model on VUV sensitive Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a versatile analytic model describing Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) for P-on-N silicon photomultipliers, with possible applications in device characterization, PDE extrapolation from limited data, simulation and design optimization. Using device specific parameters, SiPM PDE is modeled as a function of wavelength, angle of incidence, voltage, and a range of temperatures. By factoring the PDE into transmission and internal efficiency, the efficiency in liquid nobles or other dense media can be predicted. We present the measurement of the absolute PDE from 350 to 830~nm at 163~K for two VUV sensitive SiPMs: a Hamamatsu VUV4 and Fondazione Bruno Kessler VUV-HD Technology. Additional measurements of relative PDE versus angle are also included. We successfully fit the model to the data, compare with literature and show the model's predictive power by extrapolating PDE to new wavelengths and operation in liquid xenon and argon, which is useful for estimating the impact of external cross-talk in future large-scale experiments. Lastly we use the model investigate optimizing efficiency for specific applications in astroparticle physics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Measurement of three-dimensional inclusive muon-neutrino charged-current cross sections on argon with the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the differential cross section $d^{2}\sigma (E_{\nu})/ d\cos(\theta_{\mu}) dP_{\mu}$ for inclusive muon-neutrino charged-current scattering on argon. This measurement utilizes data from 6.4$\times10^{20}$ protons on target of exposure collected using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam with a mean neutrino energy of approximately 0.8~GeV. The mapping from reconstructed kinematics to truth quantities, particularly from reconstructed to true neutrino energy, is validated within uncertainties by comparing the distribution of reconstructed hadronic energy in data to that of the model prediction in different muon scattering angle bins after applying a conditional constraint from the muon momentum distribution in data. The success of this validation gives confidence that the missing energy in the MicroBooNE detector is well-modeled within uncertainties in simulation, enabling the unfolding to a three-dimensional measurement over muon momentum, muon scattering angle, and neutrino energy. The unfolded measurement covers an extensive phase space, providing a wealth of information useful for future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments measuring neutrino oscillations. Comparisons against a number of commonly used model predictions are included and their performance in different parts of the available phase-space is discussed.</description>
