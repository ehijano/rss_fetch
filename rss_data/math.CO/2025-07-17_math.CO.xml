      <title>Complex non-backtracking matrix for directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis. Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Zero Forcing on Iterated Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling how information travels throughout a network has vast applications across social sciences, cybersecurity, and graph-based neural networks. In this paper, we consider the zero forcing model for information diffusion on iterative deterministic complex network models. In particular, we continue the exploration of the Iterative Local Transitive (ILT) model and the Iterative Local Anti-Transitive (ILAT) model, both introduced by Bonato et. al. in 2009 and 2017, respectively. These models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory to generate edges through a notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend is my friend'' and anticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend.''
  Zero forcing, introduced independently by Burgarth and Giovanetti and a special working group at AIM in 2007 and 2008, begins with some set of forced vertices, the remaining are unforced. If a forced vertex has a single unforced neighbor, that neighbor becomes forced. The minimum number of vertices in a starting set required to guarantee all vertices eventually become forced is the zero forcing number of the graph. The maximum number of vertices in a starting set such that the graph cannot become fully forced is the failed zero forcing number of a graph. In this paper we provide bounds for both the zero forcing and failed zero forcing number of graphs created using both the ILT and ILAT models. In particular, we show that in the case of ILAT graphs the failed zero forcing number can only take on one of four values, dependent on the number of vertices of the graph. Finally, we briefly consider another information diffusion model, graph burning, on a more general iterated graph model.</description>

      <title>Framing Triangulations and Framing Posets of Planar DAGs with Nontrivial Netflow Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of unit flows on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with one source and one sink is known to admit regular unimodular triangulations induced by framings of the DAG. The dual graph of any of these triangulations may be given the structure of the Hasse diagram of a lattice, generalizing many variations of the Tamari lattice and the weak order. We extend this theory to flow polytopes of DAGs which may have multiple sources, multiple sinks, and nontrivial netflow vectors under certain planarity conditions. We construct a unimodular triangulation of such a flow polytope indexed by combinatorial data and give a poset structure on its maximal simplices generalizing the strongly planar one-source-one-sink case.</description>

      <title>Flows on Gentle Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of unit flows on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is known to admit regular unimodular triangulations induced by framings of the DAG. Amply framed DAGs and their triangulated flow polytopes have recently been connected with the representation theory of certain gentle algebras. We expand on this connection by defining a flow on the fringed quiver of an arbitrary gentle algebra. We call the space of unit flows its turbulence polyhedron. We show that support tau-tilting modules of a gentle algebra index a unimodular triangulation of its turbulence polyhedron. In the representation-infinite case, this triangulation is not complete and we give two different larger polyhedral dissections given by adding lower-dimensional walls to the picture. The turbulence polyhedron has a quotient map to what we define as the g-polyhedron lying in the ambient space of the g-vector fan, proving that gentle algebras are g-convex. Moreover, the images of our two types of walls under this quotient map provide two different interpretations for the complement of the g-vector fan of a gentle algebra.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable pivot-minors in graphs of large rank-depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shrub-depth and rank-depth are related graph parameters that are dense analogs of tree-depth. We prove that for every positive integer $t$, every graph of sufficiently large rank-depth contains a pivot-minor isomorphic to a path on $t$ vertices or a graph consisting of two disjoint cliques of size $t$ joined by a half graph. This answers an open problem raised by Kwon, McCarty, Oum, and Wollan in 2021.</description>

      <title>The Total Coloring Conjecture holds for planar graphs without three special subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC) for planar graphs with a maximum degree of six remains open. Previous studies suggest that TCC is valid for such graphs if they do not contain any subgraph isomorphic to a 4-fan. In this paper, we present an improved conclusion by establishing that TCC holds for planar graphs that are free of three particular substructures, namely the mushroom, the tent, and the cone. This advancement enhances previous findings by demonstrating that TCC is applicable to planar graphs with a maximum degree of six, which can accommodate sparse 4-fans, 5-fans, 5-wheels, and 6-wheels.</description>

      <title>Transversal packings in families of percolated hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a strictly $1$-balanced $k$-graph on $s$ vertices with $t$ edges and $\delta_{F,d}^T$ be the infimum of $\delta&gt;0$ such that for every $\alpha&gt;0$ and sufficiently large $n\in \mathbb{N}$, every $k$-graph system $\mathbf H=\{H_{1}, H_{2}, \dots ,H_{tn}\}$ on the same $sn$ vertices with $\delta_d(H_i)\ge (\delta+\alpha)\binom{sn-d}{k-d}$, $i\in [tn]$ contains a transversal $F$-factor, that is, an $F$-factor consisting of exactly one edge from each $H_i$. In this paper we prove the following result. Let $\mathbf{H} =\{H_{1}, H_{2}, \dots ,H_{tn}\}$ be a $k$-graph system where each $H_{i}$ is an $sn$-vertex $k$-graph with $\delta_d(H_i)\ge (\delta_{F,d}^T+\alpha)\binom{sn-d}{k-d}$. Then with high probability $\mathbf{H}(p) :=\{H_{1}(p), H_{2}(p), \dots ,H_{tn}(p)\}$ contains a transversal $F$-factor, where $H_i(p)$ is a random subhypergraph of $H_i$ and $p=\Omega(n^{-1/d_1(F)-1}(\log n)^{1/t})$. This extends a recent result by Kelly, M\"{u}yesser and Pokrovskiy, and independently by Joos, Lang and Sanhueza-Matamala. Moreover, the assumption on $p$ is best possible up to a constant. Along the way, we also obtain a spread version of a result of Pikhurko on perfect matchings in $k$-partite $k$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Decomposition Bounds for Partition Polytopes and Odd-Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assignments of a set of $m$ items into $n$ clusters of prescribed sizes $\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_n$ can be encoded as the vertices of the \emph{partition polytope} $\mathrm{PP}(\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_n)$. We prove that, if $K = \max\{\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_n\}$, then the combinatorial diameter of $\mathrm{PP}(\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_n)$ is at most $\lceil 3K/2\rceil$. This improves the previously known upper bound of $2K$.
  A \emph{cycle} (resp.~\emph{path}) \emph{odd-cover} of a graph $G$ is a set $\mathcal{H}$ of cycles (resp.~paths) such that $G$ is the symmetric difference of the graphs in $\mathcal{H}$.
  We prove that every Eulerian graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ admits a cycle odd-cover and a path odd-cover, each of size at most $\lceil 3\Delta/4\rceil$. This improves the previously known upper bound of $\Delta$.
  The two proofs share many similarities and are both based on the proof of Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary that every graph with maximum degree 4 has linear arboricity at most 3.</description>

      <title>On $2$-connected graphs avoiding cycles of length $0$ modulo $4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two integers $k$ and $\ell$, an $(\ell \text{ mod }k)$-cycle means a cycle of length $m$ such that $m\equiv \ell\pmod{k}$. In 1977, Bollob\'{a}s proved a conjecture of Burr and Erd\H{o}s by showing that if $\ell$ is even or $k$ is odd, then every $n$-vertex graph containing no $(\ell \text{ mod }k)$-cycles has at most a linear number of edges in terms of $n$. Since then, determining the exact extremal bounds for graphs without $(\ell \text{ mod }k)$-cycles has emerged as an interesting question in extremal graph theory, though the exact values are known only for a few integers $\ell$ and $k$. Recently, Gy\H{o}ri, Li, Salia, Tompkins, Varga and Zhu proved that every $n$-vertex graph containing no $(0 \text{ mod }4)$-cycles has at most $\left\lfloor \frac{19}{12}(n -1) \right\rfloor$ edges, and they provided extremal examples that reach the bound, all of which are not $2$-connected. In this paper, we show that a $2$-connected graph without $(0 \text{ mod } 4)$-cycles has at most $\left\lfloor \frac{3n-1}{2} \right\rfloor$ edges, and this bound is tight by presenting a method to construct infinitely many extremal examples.</description>

      <title>A perfect matching reciprocity method for embedding multiple hypercubes in an augmented cube: Applications to Hamiltonian decomposition and fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the embeddability of hypercubes in an important class of Cayley graphs, known as augmented cubes. An $n$-dimensional augmented cube $AQ_n$ is constructed by augmenting the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with additional edges, thus making $Q_n$ a spanning subgraph of $AQ_n$. Dong and Wang (2019) first posed the problem of determining the number of $Q_n$-isomorphic subgraphs in $AQ_n$, which still remains open. By exploiting the Cayley properties of $AQ_n$, we establish a lower bound for this number. What's more, we develop a method for constructing pairs of $Q_n$-isomorphic subgraphs in $AQ_n$ with the minimum number of common edges. This is accomplished through the use of reciprocal perfect matchings, a technique that also relies on the Cayley property of $AQ_n$. As an application, we prove that $AQ_n$ admits $n-1$ edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles when $n\geq3$ is odd and $n-2$ cycles when $n$ is even, thereby confirming a conjecture by Hung (2015) for the odd case. Additionally, we prove that $AQ_n$ has a fault-free cycle of every even length from $4$ to $2^n$ with up to $4n-8$ faulty edges, when each vertex is incident to at least two fault-free edges. This result not only provides an alternative proof for the fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity of established by Hsieh and Cian (2010), but also extends their work by demonstrating the fault-tolerant bipancyclicity of $AQ_n$.</description>

      <title>An exponential improvement for Ramsey lower bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound on the Ramsey number $r(\ell, C\ell)$ for any constant $C &gt; 1$ and sufficiently large $\ell$, showing that there exists $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(C)&gt; 0$ such that \[ r(\ell, C\ell) \geq \left(p_C^{-1/2} + \varepsilon\right)^\ell, \] where $p_C \in (0, 1/2)$ is the unique solution to $C = \frac{\log p_C}{\log(1 - p_C)}$. This provides the first exponential improvement over the classical lower bound obtained by Erd\H{o}s in 1947.</description>

      <title>A coarse Halin Grid Theorem with applications to quasi-transitive, locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a coarse version of Halin's Grid Theorem: Every one-ended, locally finite graph that contains the disjoint union of infinitely many rays as an asymptotic minor also contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor. More generally, we show that the same holds for arbitrary (not necessarily one-ended or locally finite) graphs under additional, necessary assumptions on the minor-models of the infinite rays. This resolves a conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.
  As an application, we show that every one-ended, quasi-transitive, locally finite graph contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of one-ended finitely generated groups and solves a problem of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is called a rainbow graph if all its edges have distinct colors. The anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, G)$, for a graph $G$ and a positive integer $n$, is defined as the minimum number of colors $r$ such that every exact $r$-edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ contains at least one rainbow copy of $G$. A $(k, r)$-fan graph, denoted $F_{k, r}$, is a graph composed of $k$ cliques each of size $r$, all intersecting at exactly one common vertex. In this paper, we determine $ar(n, F_{k, r})$ for $n \geq 256r^{16}(k+1)^5$, $k \geq 1$, and $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each permutation $w$, we consider the set $\mathrm{PD}(w)$ of reduced pipe dreams for $w$, partially ordered so that cover relations correspond to (generalized) chute moves. Settling a conjecture of Rubey from 2012, we prove that $\mathrm{PD}(w)$ is a lattice. To establish this result, we provide a global description of the partial order on $\mathrm{PD}(w)$ by showing that $\mathrm{PD}(w)$ is isomorphic to a poset consisting of objects called Lehmer tableaux. In addition, we prove that $\mathrm{PD}(w)$ is a semidistributive polygonal lattice whose polygons are all diamonds or pentagons.</description>

Abstract: In 2018, Stanton proved two types of generalisations of the celebrated Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities (in their $q$-series version): one with a similar shape to the original identities, and one involving binomial coefficients. In this paper, we give new proofs of these identities. For the non-binomial identities, we give bijective proofs using the original Andrews--Gordon and Bressoud identities as key ingredients. These proofs are based on particle motion introduced by Warnaar and extended by the first and third authors and Konan. For the binomial identities, we use the Bailey lemma and key lemmas of McLaughlin and Lovejoy, and the order in which we apply the different lemmas plays a central role in the result. We also give an alternative proof of the non-binomial identities using the Bailey lattice. With each of these proofs, new Stanton-type generalisations of classical identities arise naturally, such as generalisations of Kur\c{s}ung\"oz's analogue of Bressoud's identity with opposite parity conditions, and of the Bressoud--G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities.</description>

      <title>On the Tur\'anability and tileability of oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oriented graph $H$ is Tur\'anable (resp. tileable) if there exist $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every regular tournament on $n \ge n_0$ vertices contains a copy of $H$ (resp. a perfect $H$-tiling). We disprove a conjectured characterization of Tur\'anable oriented graphs by DeBiasio, Han, Lo, Molla, Piga, and Treglown, show that there are Tur\'anable oriented graphs which are not tileable, and provide a new example of tileable oriented graph.</description>

      <title>Beyond the MaxCut problem in $H$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Zhang proves that if $G$ is an $H$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $G$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+c_Hm^{0.5001}$, making a significant step towards a well known conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'as, Krivelevich and Sudakov. We show that the methods of Zhang can be further boosted, and prove the following strengthening. If $G$ is a graph with $m$ edges and no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$, then $G$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$.
  In addition, we sharpen another result of Zhang by proving that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph with MaxCut of size at most $m/2+n^{1+\varepsilon}$ (or its smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_n$ satisfies $|\lambda_n|\leq n^{\varepsilon}$), then $G$ is $n^{-\varepsilon}$-close to the disjoint union of cliques for some absolute constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical designs are subsets of vertices of a graph that perfectly average a selected set of eigenvectors of the Graph Laplacian. We show that in highly-structured graphs, graphical designs can coincide with highly structured and well-known combinatorial objects: orthogonal arrays in hypercube graphs, combinatorial block designs and extremizers of the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem in Johnson graphs, and t-wise uniform sets of permutations and symmetric subgroups in normal Cayley graphs on the symmetric group. These connections allow tools from spectral graph theory to bear on these combinatorial objects. We also show that the central vertex in a Mycielskian is an extremely good design and certain designs of the Mycielskian coincide with designs of the original graph.</description>

Abstract: The generalized Ramsey number $r(G, H, q)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of $G$ such that every isomorphic copy of $H$ has at least $q$ colors. In this note, we improve the upper and lower bounds on $r(K_{n, n}, C_{2k}, 3)$. Our upper bound answers a question of Lane and Morrison. For $k=3$ we obtain the asymptotically sharp estimate $r(K_{n, n}, C_6, 3) = \frac{7}{20} n + o(n)$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Edge Eigenvector Universality for Random Regular Graphs: Berry-Esseen Bounds with Explicit Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds for edge eigenvector statistics in random regular graphs. For any $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with fixed $d \geq 3$ and deterministic unit vector $\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{e}$, we prove that the normalized overlap $\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle$ satisfies \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \left|\mathbb{P}\left(\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle \leq x\right) - \Phi(x)\right| \leq C_d N^{-1/6+\varepsilon} \] where $\mathbf{u}_2$ is the second eigenvector and $C_d \leq \tilde{C}d^3\varepsilon^{-10}$ for an absolute constant $\tilde{C}$. This provides the first explicit convergence rate for the recent edge eigenvector universality results of He, Huang, and Yau \cite{HHY25}.
  Our proof introduces a single-scale comparison method using constrained Dyson Brownian motion that preserves the degree constraint $\tilde{H}_t\mathbf{e} = 0$ throughout the evolution. The key technical innovation is a sharp edge isotropic local law with explicit constant $C(d,\varepsilon) \leq \tilde{C}d\varepsilon^{-5}$, enabling precise control of eigenvector overlap dynamics.
  At the critical time $t_* = N^{-1/3+\varepsilon}$, we perform a fourth-order cumulant comparison with constrained GOE, achieving optimal error bounds through a single comparison rather than the traditional multi-scale approach. We extend our results to joint universality for the top $K$ edge eigenvectors with $K \leq N^{1/10-\delta}$, showing they converge to independent Gaussians. Through analysis of eigenvalue spacing barriers, critical time scales, and comparison across multiple proof methods, we provide evidence that the $N^{-1/6}$ rate is optimal for sparse regular graphs. All constants are tracked explicitly throughout, enabling finite-size applications in spectral algorithms and network analysis.</description>

      <title>Oriented graphs on curve complex I: hyperbolic and extremal length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate oriented graphs based on the curve complex $C(S)$ of a closed surface $S$ and induced by functions on the vertex set of $C(S)$. In particular, we introduce the Dehn quasi-homothetic functions, which behave similarly to homotheties under repeated Dehn twists. We prove that any two positive such functions of the same type induce different oriented graphs unless they are proportional. This leads to a new rigidity result for closed hyperbolic surfaces -- distinct from the $9g-9$ theorem and length spectrum rigidity -- knowing only for any two disjoint simple closed curves which one is longer (in terms of hyperbolic or extremal length) suffices to determine the hyperbolic metric on the surface. We also prove that each automorphism of the oriented graph induced by a function with sublevel sets finite is induced by a self-homeomorphism of $S$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the cave polynomial of a polymatroid and show that it yields a valuative function on polymatroids. The support of this polynomial after homogenization is again a polymatroid. The cave polynomial gives a $K$-theoretic description of a polymatroid in the augmented $K$-ring of a multisymmetric lift. As applications, we settle two conjectures: one by Bandari, Bayati, and Herzog regarding polymatroidal ideals, and another by Castillo, Cid-Ruiz, Mohammadi, and Monta\~no regarding the M\"obius support of a polymatroid.</description>

      <title>Power in Sharing Networks with a priori Unions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel family of power indices tailored for sharing networks in technological markets, where firms operate competitively within, but not across, distinct industrial sectors. In these settings, inter-firm collaboration structures emerge from formal technology licensing agreements. The proposed indices are defined over graphs with a priori unions and combine two key centrality measures - degree-based and rescaled eigenvector centrality - modulated by positive market coefficients that reflect sectoral dynamics. We first explore the monotonicity properties of these indices, highlighting their responsiveness to local changes in network structure. Interestingly, major economic actors exhibit structural stability when inter-sectoral technological spillovers are minimal. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical underpinnings by characterizing the indices as the Shapley values of a family of coherent and economically interpretable transferable utility (TU) games defined over such graphs. However, for a broad class of network structures, the core of these TU games is often empty, signaling inherent instability in technological sharing arrangements. Finally, we offer an axiomatic foundation for this family of indices, proving independence of the proposed axioms. This axiomatization extends naturally to exchange networks, even when stage-propagation coefficients are not positive.</description>

Abstract: A mutation cycle is a cycle in a graph whose vertices are labeled by the quivers in a given mutation class and whose edges correspond to single mutations. For any fixed $n\ge 4$, we describe arbitrarily long mutation cycles involving $n$-vertex quivers. Each of these mutation cycles allows for an arbitrary choice of $n \choose 2$ positive integer parameters. None of the mutation cycles we construct can be paved by short mutation cycles.</description>

Abstract: The Friendship Theorem states that if in a party any pair of persons has precisely one common friend, then there is always a person who is everybody's friend and the theorem has been proved by Paul Erd\H{o}s, Alfr\'{e}d R\'{e}nyi, and Vera T. S\'{o}s in 1966. ``What would happen if instead any pair of persons likes precisely one person?" While a friendship relation is symmetric, a liking relation may not be symmetric. Therefore to represent a liking relation we should use a directed graph. We call this digraph a ``liking digraph". It is easy to check that a symmetric liking digraph becomes a friendship graph if each directed cycle of length two is replaced with an edge. In this paper, we provide a digraph formulation of the Friendship Theorem which characterizes the liking digraphs. We also establish a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of liking digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If each vertex of an acyclic digraph has indegree at most $i$ and outdegree at most $j$, then it is called an $(i,j)$ digraph, which was introduced by Hefner~{\it et al.}~(1991). Whereas Hefner~{\it et al.} characterized $(i,j)$ digraphs whose competition graphs are interval, characterizing the competition graphs of $(i,j)$ digraphs is not an easy task. In this paper, we introduce the concept of $\langle i,j \rangle$ digraphs, which relax the acyclicity condition of $(i,j)$ digraphs, and study their competition graphs. By doing so, we obtain quite meaningful results. Firstly, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a loopless graph being an $\langle i,j \rangle$ competition graph for some positive integers $i$ and $j$. Then we study on an $\langle i,j \rangle$ competition graph being chordal and present a forbidden subdigraph characterization. Finally, we study the family of $\langle i,j \rangle$ competition graphs, denoted by $\mathcal{G}_{\langle i,j \rangle}$, and identify the set containment relation on $\{\mathcal{G}_{\langle i,j \rangle}\colon\, i,j \ge 1\}$.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Ramsey Theorem for Ordered Hypergraph Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04813v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove essentially sharp bounds for Ramsey numbers of ordered hypergraph matchings, inroduced recently by Dudek, Grytczuk, and Ruci\'{n}ski. Namely, for any $r \ge 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we show that any collection $\mathcal H$ of $n$ pairwise disjoint subsets in $\mathbb Z$ of size $r$ contains a subcollection of size $\lfloor n^{1/(2^r-1)}/2\rfloor$ in which every pair of sets are in the same relative position with respect to the linear ordering on $\mathbb Z$. This improves previous bounds of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski and of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and is sharp up to a factor of $2$. For large $r$, we even obtain such a subcollection of size $\lfloor (1-o(1))\cdot n^{1/(2^r-1)}\rfloor$, which is asymptotically tight (here, the $o(1)$-term tends to zero as $r \to \infty$, regardless of the value of $n$). Furthermore, we prove a multiparameter extension of this result where one wants to find a clique of prescribed size $m_P$ for each relative position pattern $P$. Our bound is sharp for all choices of parameters $m_P$, up to a constant factor depending on $r$ only. This answers questions of Anastos-Jin-Kwan-Sudakov and of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski.</description>

Abstract: The diameter of a directed graph is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices. We study a problem that generalizes \textsc{Oriented Diameter}: For a given directed graph and a positive integer $d$, what is the minimum number of arc reversals required to obtain a graph with diameter at most $d$? We investigate variants of this problem, considering the number of arc reversals and the target diameter as parameters. We show hardness results under certain parameter restrictions, and give polynomial time algorithms for planar and cactus graphs. This work is partly motivated by the relation between oriented diameter and the volume of directed edge polytopes, which we show to be independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a digraph is a $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph if every $t$ vertices have exactly $\lambda$ common out-neighbors. In 1975, Plesn\'{i}k [Graphs with a homogeneity, 1975. {\it Glasnik Mathematicki} 10:9-23] proved that any $(t,1)$-liking digraph is the complete digraph on $t+1$ vertices for each $t\geq 3$. Choi {\it et al}. [A digraph version of the Friendship Theorem, 2025. {\it Discrete mathematics}, 348(1), 114238] showed that a $(2,1)$-liking digraph is a fancy wheel digraph or a $k$-diregular digraph for some positive integer $k$. In this paper, we extend these results by completely characterizing the $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraphs with $t \geq \lambda+2$ and giving some equivalent conditions for a $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph being a complete digraph on $t+\lambda$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: A well-known theorem of Mantel states that every $n$-vertex graph with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor $ edges contains a triangle. An interesting problem in extremal graph theory studies the minimum number of edges contained in triangles among graphs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges. Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau (1992) showed that a graph on $n$ vertices with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor $ edges contains at least $2\lfloor n/2\rfloor +1$ edges in triangles. Such edges are called triangular edges. In this paper, we present a spectral version of the result of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau. Using the supersaturation-stability and the spectral technique, we prove that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) \ge \sqrt{\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor}$ contains at least $2 \lfloor {n}/{2} \rfloor -1$ triangular edges, unless $G$ is a balanced complete bipartite graph. The method in our paper has some interesting applications. Firstly, the supersaturation-stability can be used to revisit a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s concerning with the booksize of a graph, which was initially proved by Edwards (unpublished), and independently by Khad\v{z}iivanov and Nikiforov (1979). Secondly, our method can improve the bound on the order $n$ of the spectral extremal graph when we forbid the friendship graph as a substructure. We drop the condition that requires the order $n$ to be sufficiently large, which was investigated by Cioab\u{a}, Feng, Tait and Zhang (2020) using the triangle removal lemma. Thirdly, this method can be utilized to deduce the classical stability for odd cycles and it gives more concise bounds on parameters. Finally, the supersaturation-stability could be applied to deal with the spectral graph problems on counting triangles, which was recently studied by Ning and Zhai (2023).</description>

      <title>On mutually $\mu$-intersecting quasi-Hermitian varieties with some applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal W$ be a non-empty set of points of a finite Desarguesian projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$. A collection of varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ is \emph{mutually $\mu$-intersecting (relatively to $\mathcal W$)} if its elements meet all $\mathcal W$ in the same number of points and pairwise intersect in $\mathcal W$ in exactly $\mu$-points. Here we construct a new family of mutually $\mu$-intersecting algebraic varieties by using certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q^2)$ where $q$ is any prime power. With the help of these quasi-Hermitian varieties we provide a new construction of $5$-dimensional MDS codes over ${\mathbb F}_q$ as well as an infinite family of simple orthogonal arrays $OA(q^{2n-1},q^{2n-2},q,2)$ of index $\mu=q^{2n-3}$.</description>

      <title>On an entropic analogue of additive energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</description>

      <title>Spectral supersaturation: Triangles and bowties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Ning and Zhai (2023) proved that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) \ge \sqrt{\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor}$ has at least $\lfloor n/2\rfloor -1$ triangles, unless $G=K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Using the supersaturation-stability method, we prove a stability variant of Ning-Zhai's result by showing that such a graph $G$ contains at least $n-3$ triangles if no vertex is in all triangles of $G$. This result could also be viewed as a spectral version of a result of Xiao and Katona (2021). The second part concerns with the spectral supersaturation for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a common vertex. A theorem of Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, Gould and Gunderson (1995) says that every $n$-vertex graph with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor +1$ edges contains a bowtie. For graphs of given order, the spectral supersaturation problem has not been considered for substructures that are not color-critical. In this paper, we give the first such theorem by counting the number of bowties. Let $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$ by embedding two disjoint edges into the vertex part of size $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. Our result shows that every graph $G$ with $n\ge 8.8 \times 10^6$ vertices and $\lambda (G)\ge \lambda (K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2})$ contains at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2}$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This gives a spectral correspondence of a theorem of Kang, Makai and Pikhurko (2020). The method used in our paper provides a probable way to establish the spectral counting results for other graphs, even for non-color-critical graphs.</description>

      <title>Partition Regularity of Nonlinear Rado Systems: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05542v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matrix \( A \) is called \emph{kernel partition regular} if, for every finite coloring of the natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} \), there exists a monochromatic solution to the equation \( A\vec{X} = 0 \). In 1933, Rado characterized such matrices by showing that a matrix is kernel partition regular if and only if it satisfies the so-called \emph{column condition}. In this article, we investigate polynomial extensions of Rado's theorem. We exhibit several nonlinear systems of equations that are kernel partition regular and demonstrate that satisfying the column condition continues to ensure kernel partition regularity even when the system is augmented with a polynomial term. Then we prove a necessary condition for the partition regularity of Nonlinear Rado systems.</description>

      <title>The maximum sum of the sizes of all intersections within $m$-size families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, let $\omega(\mathcal{F}):=\sum_{\{A,B\}\subset \mathcal{F}}|A\cap B|$. In this paper, we prove that provided $n$ is sufficiently large, for any $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|=m$, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ is maximized by the family consisting of the first $m$ sets in the lexicographical ordering on $\binom{[n]}{k}$. Compared to the maximum number of adjacent pairs in families, determined by Das, Gan and Sudakov in 2016, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ distinguishes the contributions of intersections of different sizes. Then our results is an extension of Ahlswede and Katona's results in 1978, which determine the maximum number of adjacent edges in graphs. Besides, since $\omega(\mathcal{F})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{x\in [n]}|\{F\in \mathcal{F}:x\in F\}|^2-km\right)$ for $k$-uniform family with size $m$, our results also give a sharp upper bound of the sum of squares of degrees in a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Packing Designs with large block size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given positive integers $v$, $k$, $t$ and $\lambda$ with $v \geq k \geq t$, a packing design PD$_{\lambda}(v,k,t)$ is a pair $(V,\mathcal{B})$, where $V$ is a $v$-set and $\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of $k$-subsets of $V$ such that each $t$-subset of $V$ appears in at most $\lambda$ elements of $\mathcal{B}$. When $\lambda=1$, a PD$_1(v,k,t)$ is equivalent to a binary code with length $v$, minimum distance $2(k-t+1)$ and constant weight $k$. The maximum size of a PD$_{\lambda}(v,k,t)$ is called the {packing number}, denoted PDN$_{\lambda}(v,k,t)$. In this paper we consider packing designs with $k$ large relative to $v$. We prove that for a positive integer $n$, PDN$_{\lambda}(v,k,t) = n$ whenever $nk-(t-1)\binom{n}{\lambda+1} \leq \lambda v &lt; (n+1)k-(t-1)\binom{n+1}{\lambda+1}$.
  We also prove that if no point appears in more than three blocks, then the blocks of a PD$_2(v,k,2)$ can be ordered so that no ordered pair occurs more than once. This produces a directed packing design and we show that the corresponding directed packing number is equal to $n$ when $nk-\binom{n}{3} \leq 2v &lt; (n+1)k-\binom{n+1}{3}$. Such directed packing designs yield $(k-t)$-insertion/deletion codes.</description>

      <title>Totally odd immersions of complete graphs in graph products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $im(G)$ denote the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as an immersion. A recent paper of Collins, Heenehan, and McDonald (2023) studied the behaviour of this parameter under graph products, asking how large can $im(G\ast H)$ be in terms of $im(G)$ and $im(H)$, when $\ast$ is one of the four standard graph products. We consider a similar question for the parameter $toi(G)$ which denotes the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as a totally odd immersion. As an application, we obtain that no minimum counterexample to the immersion-analogue of the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture can be obtained from the Cartesian, direct (tensor), lexicographic or strong product of graphs.</description>

      <title>On likelihood of a Condorcet winner for uniformly random and independent voter preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of voting contest with $m$ voters and $n$ candidates, with each voter ranking the candidates in order of preference, without ties. A Condorcet winner is a candidate who gets more than $m/2$ votes in pairwise contest with every other candidate. An ``impartial culture'' setting is the case when each voter chooses his/her candidate preference list uniformly at random from all $n!$ preferences, and does it independently of all other voters. For impartial culture case, Robert May and Lisa Sauermann showed that when $m=2k-1$ is fixed ($k=2$ and $k&gt;2$ respectively), and $n$ grows indefinitely, the probability of a Condorcet winner is small, of order $n^{-(k-1)/k}$. We show that when $m$ grows indefinitely and $m\gg n^4$, the probability of a Condercet winner is $1-O(n^2/m^{1/2})\to 1$.</description>

Abstract: We further explore the notion of Ulam words considered by Bade, Cui, Labelle, and Li, giving some lower bounds on how many there are of a given length. Gaps between words and words of special type also reveal remarkable structure. By substantially increasing the number of computed terms, we are also able to sharpen some of the conjectures made by Bade et al.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We observe that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a matroid Schubert variety and prove that the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar {\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ are divisors indexed by root system data. We prove that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety and find an affine paving of $\bar {\mathfrak h},$ where the strata are given by the orbits of $\mathfrak h.$ We show that the strata of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ correspond bijectively to subspaces of the corresponding Coxeter hyperplane arrangement studied by Orlik and Solomon, and prove that the associated posets are isomorphic. As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases. We show that the Weyl group $W$ acts on $\bar {\mathfrak h}$, and describe $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb C)$ as a representation of $W$, and compute the cup product for $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolomino is a pencil-and-paper logic puzzle popularized by the Japanese publisher Nikoli (like Sudoku, Kakuro, Slitherlink, Masyu, and Fillomino). The puzzle's name reflects its core mechanic: the shapes of polyomino-like blocks that players must draw gradually "evolve" in the directions indicated by pre-drawn arrows. We prove, by reduction from 3-SAT, that the question of whether there exists at least one solution to an Evolomino puzzle satisfying the rules is NP-complete. Since our reduction is parsimonious, i.e., it preserves the number of distinct solutions, we also prove that counting the number of solutions to an Evolomino puzzle is #P-complete.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Spread-Global Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, particularly in the context of homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example is the spread exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset, in which the indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite for finite posets and not uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It was conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture and, more generally, prove that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing so, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary grid posets.</description>
