      <title>Relative entropy estimate and geometric ergodicity for implicit Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implicit Langevin Monte Carlo (iLMC) method, which simulates the overdamped Langevin equation via an implicit iteration rule. In many applications, iLMC is favored over other explicit schemes such as the (explicit) Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). LMC may blow up when the drift field $\nabla U$ is not globally Lipschitz, while iLMC has convergence guarantee when the drift is only one-sided Lipschitz. Starting from an adapted continuous-time interpolation, we prove a time-discretization error bound under the relative entropy (or the Kullback-Leibler divergence), where a crucial gradient estimate for the logarithm numerical density is obtained via a sequence of PDE techniques, including Bernstein method. Based on a reflection-type continuous-discrete coupling method, we prove the geometric ergodicity of iLMC under the Wasserstein-1 distance. Moreover, we extend the error bound to a uniform-in-time one by combining the relative entropy error bound and the ergodicity. Our proof technique is universal and can be applied to other implicit or splitting schemes for simulating stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drifts.</description>

      <title>Numerical boundary flux functions that give provable bounds for nonlinear initial boundary value problems with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy for interpreting nonlinear, characteristic-type penalty terms as numerical boundary flux functions that provide provable bounds for solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic initial boundary value problems with open boundaries. This approach is enabled by recent work that found how to express the entropy flux as a quadratic form defined by a symmetric boundary matrix. The matrix formulation provides additional information for how to systematically design characteristic-based penalty terms for the weak enforcement of boundary conditions. A special decomposition of the boundary matrix is required to define an appropriate set of characteristic-type variables. The new boundary fluxes are directly compatible with high-order accurate split form discontinuous Galerkin spectral element and similar methods and guarantee that the solution is entropy stable and bounded solely by external data. We derive inflow-outflow boundary fluxes specifically for the Burgers equation and the two-dimensional shallow water equations, which are also energy stable. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new nonlinear fluxes do not fail in situations where standard boundary treatments based on linear analysis do.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article initiates the study of space-time adaptive mesh refinements for time-dependent boundary element formulations of wave equations. Based on error indicators of residual type, we formulate an adaptive boundary element procedure for acoustic soft-scattering problems with local tensor-product refinements of the space-time mesh. We discuss the algorithmic challenges and investigate the proposed method in numerical experiments. In particular, we study the performance and improved convergence rates with respect to the energy norm for problems dominated by spatial, temporal or traveling singularities of the solution. The efficiency of the considered rigorous and heuristic a posteriori error indicators is discussed.</description>

      <title>DeepPAAC: A New Deep Galerkin Method for Principal-Agent Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider numerical resolution of principal-agent (PA) problems in continuous time. We formulate a generic PA model with continuous and lump payments and a multi-dimensional strategy of the agent. To tackle the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an implicit Hamiltonian we develop a novel deep learning method: the Deep Principal-Agent Actor Critic (DeepPAAC) Actor-Critic algorithm. DeepPAAC is able to handle multi-dimensional states and controls, as well as constraints. We investigate the role of the neural network architecture, training designs, loss functions, etc. on the convergence of the solver, presenting five different case studies.</description>

      <title>Normalized tensor train decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensors with unit Frobenius norm are fundamental objects in many fields, including scientific computing and quantum physics, which are able to represent normalized eigenvectors and pure quantum states. While the tensor train decomposition provides a powerful low-rank format for tackling high-dimensional problems, it does not intrinsically enforce the unit-norm constraint. To address this, we introduce the normalized tensor train (NTT) decomposition, which aims to approximate a tensor by unit-norm tensors in tensor train format. The low-rank structure of NTT decomposition not only saves storage and computational cost but also preserves the underlying unit-norm structure. We prove that the set of fixed-rank NTT tensors forms a smooth manifold, and the corresponding Riemannian geometry is derived, paving the way for geometric methods. We propose NTT-based methods for low-rank tensor recovery, high-dimensional eigenvalue problem, estimation of stabilizer rank, and calculation of the minimum output R\'enyi 2-entropy of quantum channels. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and scalability of the proposed NTT-based methods.</description>

      <title>The Loewner framework applied to Zolotarev sign and ratio problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a numerical study concerning the approximation of functions associated with the 3rd and 4th Zolotarev problems. We compare various methods, in particular the Loewner framework, the standard AAA algorithm, and recently-proposed extensions of AAA (namely, the sign and Lawson variants). We show that the Loewner framework is fast and reliable, and provides approximants with a high level of accuracy. When the approximants are of a higher degree, Loewner approximants are often more accurate than near-optimal ones computed with AAA-Lawson. Last but not least, the Loewner framework is a direct method for which the running time is typically lower than that of the iterative AAA-Lawson variants. Moreover, for the latter, the running time increases substantially with the degree of the approximant, whereas for the Loewner method, it remains constant. These claims are supported by an extensive numerical treatment.</description>

      <title>Mean square error analysis of stochastic gradient and variance-reduced sampling algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers mean square error (MSE) analysis for stochastic gradient sampling algorithms applied to underdamped Langevin dynamics under a global convexity assumption. A novel discrete Poisson equation framework is developed to bound the time-averaged sampling error. For the Stochastic Gradient UBU (SG-UBU) sampler, we derive an explicit MSE bound and establish that the numerical bias exhibits first-order convergence with respect to the step size $h$, with the leading error coefficient proportional to the variance of the stochastic gradient. The analysis is further extended to variance-reduced algorithms for finite-sum potentials, specifically the SVRG-UBU and SAGA-UBU methods. For these algorithms, we identify a phase transition phenomenon whereby the convergence rate of the numerical bias shifts from first to second order as the step size decreases below a critical threshold. Theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments. In addition, the analysis provides a practical empirical criterion for selecting between the mini-batch SG-UBU and SVRG-UBU samplers to achieve optimal computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>An efficient boundary integral equation solution technique for solving aperiodic scattering problems from two-dimensional, periodic boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an efficient boundary integral equation technique for solving two-dimensional Helmholtz problems defined in the half-plane bounded by an infinite, periodic curve with Neumann boundary conditions and an aperiodic point source. The technique is designed for boundaries where one period does not require a large number of discretization points to achieve high accuracy. The Floquet--Bloch transform turns the problem into evaluating a contour integral where the integrand is the solution of quasiperiodic boundary value problems. To approximate the integral, one must solve a collection of these problems. This manuscript uses a variant of the periodizing scheme by Cho and Barnett which alleviates the need for evaluating the quasiperiodic Green's function and is amenable to a large amount of precomputation that can be reused for all of the necessary solves. The solution technique is accelerated by the use of low rank linear algebra. The numerical results illustrate that the presented method is 20-30 faster than the technique utilizing the quasiperiodic Green's function for a stair-like geometry.</description>

      <title>A Two-stage Adaptive Lifting PINN Framework for Solving Viscous Approximations to Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training physics informed neural networks PINNs for hyperbolic conservation laws near the inviscid limit presents considerable difficulties because strong form residuals become ill posed at shock discontinuities, while small viscosity regularization introduces narrow boundary layers that exacerbate spectral bias. To address these issues this paper proposes a novel two stage adaptive lifting PINN, a lifting based framework designed to mitigate such challenges without requiring a priori knowledge of the interface geometry. The key idea is to augment the physical coordinates by introducing a learned auxiliary field generated through r adaptive coordinate transformations. Theoretically we first derive an a posteriori L2 error estimate to quantify how training difficulty depends on viscosity. Secondly we provide a statistical interpretation revealing that embedded sampling induces variance reduction analogous to importance sampling. Finally we perform an NTK and gradient flow analysis, demonstrating that input augmentation improves conditioning and accelerates residual decay. Supported by these insights our numerical experiments show accelerated and more stable convergence as well as accurate reconstructions near discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Spurious resonances for substructured FEM-BEM coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in time-harmonic acoustic scattering by an impenetrable obstacle in a medium where the wavenumber is constant in an exterior unbounded subdomain and is possibly heterogeneous in a bounded subdomain. The associated Helmholtz boundary value problem can be solved by coupling the Finite Element Method (FEM) in the heterogeneous subdomain with the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in the homogeneous subdomain. Recently, we designed and analyzed a new substructured FEM-BEM formulation, called Generalized Optimized Schwarz Method (GOSM). Unfortunately, it is well known that, even when the initial boundary value problem is well-posed, the variational formulation of classical FEM-BEM couplings can be ill-posed for certain wavenumbers, called spurious resonances. In this paper, we focus on the Johnson-N\'ed\'elec and Costabel couplings and show that the GOSM derived from both is not immune to that issue. In particular, we give an explicit expression of the kernel of the local operator associated with the interface between the FEM and BEM subdomains. That kernel and the one of classical FEM-BEM couplings are simultaneously non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning of GMRES for Helmholtz problems with quasimodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element methods are effective for Helmholtz problems involving complex geometries and heterogeneous media. However, the resulting linear systems are often large, indefinite, and challenging for iterative solvers, particularly at high wave numbers or near resonant conditions. We derive a GMRES convergence bound that incorporates the nonlinear behavior of the relative residual and relates convergence to harmonic Ritz values. This perspective reveals how small eigenvalues associated with quasimodes can hinder convergence, and when they cease to have an effect. These phenomena occur in domain decomposition, and we illustrate them through numerical experiments. We also combine domain decomposition methods with deflation techniques using (approximate) eigenvectors tailored to resonant regimes. Their impact on GMRES performance is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision multigrid with smoothing based on incomplete Cholesky factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid methods are popular iterative methods for solving large-scale sparse systems of linear equations. We present a mixed precision formulation of the multigrid V-cycle with general assumptions on the finite precision errors coming from the application of coarsest-level solver and smoothing. Inspired by existing analysis, we derive a bound on the relative finite precision error of the V-cycle which gives insight into how the finite precision errors from the individual components of the method may affect the overall finite precision error. We use the result to study V-cycle methods with smoothing based on incomplete Cholesky factorization. The results imply that in certain settings the precisions used for applying the IC smoothing can be significantly lower than the precision used for computing the residual, restriction, prolongation and correction on the concrete level. We perform numerical experiments using simulated floating point arithmetic with the MATLAB Advanpix toolbox as well as experiments computed on GPUs using the Ginkgo library. The experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and show that in the considered settings the IC smoothing can be applied in relatively low precisions, resulting in significant speedups (up to 1.43x) and energy savings (down to 71%) in comparison with the uniform double precision variant.</description>

      <title>A variational Lippmann-Schwinger-type approach for the Helmholtz impedance problem on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, reduced order modeling methods have been applied to solving inverse boundary value problems arising in frequency domain scattering theory. A key step in projection-based reduced order model methods is the use of a sesquilinear form associated with the forward boundary value problem. However, in contrast to scattering problems posed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, boundary value formulations lose certain structural properties, most notably the classical Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is no longer available. In this paper we derive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a Helmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance boundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation of the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation which can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We first establish analytical properties of our variational Lippmann-Schwinger type operator. Based on these results, we then show that the parameter-to-state map, which maps a refractive index to the corresponding wavefield, maps weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent ones when restricted to refractive indices in Lebesgue spaces with exponent greater than 2. Finally, we use the derived weak to strong sequential continuity to show existence of minimizers for a reduced order model based optimization methods aimed at solving the inverse boundary value problem as well as for a conventional data misfit based waveform inversion method.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Minimum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization under an Expanded Sufficiently Scattered Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However, its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.</description>

      <title>Signature-Based Universal Bilinear Approximations for Nonlinear Systems and Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with non-Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Such systems can be approximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role in the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated integrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a universal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the state or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In contrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains feasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear system grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is typically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order reduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with non-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially low-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original nonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to learn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is model-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process. Consequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data fitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparing EPGP Surrogates and Finite Elements Under Degree-of-Freedom Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time $L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Projection Methods for Operator Learning and Universal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a new universal approximation theorem for continuous (possibly nonlinear) operators on arbitrary Banach spaces using the Leray-Schauder mapping. Moreover, we introduce and study a method for operator learning in Banach spaces $L^p$ of functions with multiple variables, based on orthogonal projections on polynomial bases. We derive a universal approximation result for operators where we learn a linear projection and a finite dimensional mapping under some additional assumptions. For the case of $p=2$, we give some sufficient conditions for the approximation results to hold. This article serves as the theoretical framework for a deep learning methodology in operator learning.</description>

      <title>Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities.
  This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method.
  Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</description>

      <title>Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Condition Numbers and Eigenvalue Spectra of Shallow Networks on Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and \emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n \subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Parametric Hierarchical Matrix Approximations to Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel matrices are ubiquitous in computational mathematics, often arising from applications in machine learning and scientific computing. In two or three spatial or feature dimensions, such problems can be approximated efficiently by a class of matrices known as hierarchical matrices. A hierarchical matrix consists of a hierarchy of small near-field blocks (or sub-matrices) stored in a dense format and large far-field blocks approximated by low-rank matrices. Standard methods for forming hierarchical matrices do not account for the fact that kernel matrices depend on specific hyperparameters; for example, in the context of Gaussian processes, hyperparameters must be optimized over a fixed parameter space. We introduce a new class of hierarchical matrices, namely, parametric (parameter-dependent) hierarchical matrices. Members of this new class are parametric $\mathcal{H}$-matrices and parametric $\mathcal{H}^{2}$-matrices. The construction of a parametric hierarchical matrix follows an offline-online paradigm. In the offline stage, the near-field and far-field blocks are approximated by using polynomial approximation and tensor compression. In the online stage, for a particular hyperparameter, the parametric hierarchical matrix is instantiated efficiently as a standard hierarchical matrix. The asymptotic costs for storage and computation in the offline stage are comparable to the corresponding standard approaches of forming a hierarchical matrix. However, the online stage of our approach requires no new kernel evaluations, and the far-field blocks can be computed more efficiently than standard approaches. {Numerical experiments show over $100\times$ speedups compared with existing techniques.}</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modeling and simulation of two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a rigorous thermodynamic framework, this work develops a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model grounded in the Helmholtz free energy formalism. The model maintains full thermodynamic consistency by simultaneously satisfying energy conservation and entropy production laws in two-fluid systems. By analyzing the convex-concave structure of the Helmholtz free energy density, we systematically derive key thermodynamic variables-chemical potential, entropy density, and internal energy-in a self-consistent manner. Building on this foundation, we construct a temporally discrete numerical scheme that inherits the thermodynamic consistency of the continuous model. The scheme is proven to adhere rigorously to both the first and second laws of thermodynamics. For the implemented two-dimensional degenerate system, we establish comprehensive a priori error estimates in space and time. Numerical simulations validate the model's effectiveness in capturing essential plasma phenomena, demonstrating its applicability to complex physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in stochastic homogenization and adjustments for the RVE method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of a given symmetry of a random microstructure on the obtained effective tensor and its fluctuation in the context of thermal conductivity, and study strategies for enforcing these symmetries in postprocessing via orthogonal projectors. Within the framework of the representative volume element (RVE) method, we establish the invariance conditions for the effective tensor and its fluctuation under different symmetry groups of the microstructure. Interestingly, the symmetry of the considered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and compromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this issue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected symmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the effective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic errors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to unbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected symmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations, we study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and their fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the symmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures of industrial scale.</description>

      <title>A Geomechanically-Informed Framework for Wellbore Trajectory Prediction: Integrating First-Principles Kinematics with a Rigorous Derivation of Gated Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate wellbore trajectory prediction is a paramount challenge in subsurface engineering, governed by complex interactions between the drilling assembly and heterogeneous geological formations. This research establishes a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous framework for trajectory prediction that moves beyond empirical modeling to a geomechanically-informed, data-driven surrogate approach.The study leverages Log ASCII Standard (LAS) and wellbore deviation (DEV) data from 14 wells in the Gulfaks oil field, treating petrophysical logs not merely as input features, but as proxies for the mechanical properties of the rock that fundamentally govern drilling dynamics. A key contribution of this work is the formal derivation of wellbore kinematic models, including the Average Angle method and Dogleg Severity, from the first principles of vector calculus and differential geometry, contextualizing them as robust numerical integration schemes. The core of the predictive model is a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, for which we provide a complete, step-by-step derivation of the forward propagation dynamics and the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) training algorithm. This detailed theoretical exposition, often omitted in applied studies, clarifies the mechanisms by which the network learns temporal dependencies. The methodology encompasses a theoretically justified data preprocessing pipeline, including feature normalization, uniform depth resampling, and sequence generation. Trajectory post-processing and error analysis are conducted using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2).</description>
