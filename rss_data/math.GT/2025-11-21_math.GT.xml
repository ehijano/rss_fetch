      <title>Constructing knots with low rational genera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a flexible construction for knots in the 3-sphere that bound surfaces of unexpectedly low genus in punctured open books on 3-manifolds. We use this construction to give the first examples of knots whose genus differs in different $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ homology balls. We also establish that every knot bounds a M{\"o}bius band in a rational homology ball, and that there are knots whose genus in $T^4$ and $B^4$ differ arbitrarily.</description>

      <title>Equivariant embeddings of Riemann surfaces in Euclidean spaces with minimal dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_g$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus $g$. Let $G$ be a finite subgroup of the automorphism group of $\Sigma_g$. It is well known that there exists a smooth $G$-equivariant embedding from $\Sigma_g$ to some Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $d_g(G)$ be the minimal possible $n$ for $(\Sigma_g,G)$. We compute the value of $d_g(G)$ in certain cases. Especially, we show that: for the automorphism group of the closed Riemann surface which comes from the principal congruence subgroup of level $p$, where $p\geq 7$ is prime, $d_g(G)=p+1$. As a corollary, the minimal $n$ for the Hurwitz action on the Klein quartic is equal to $8$.
  Three kinds of methods are used in the computation, which are related to the representations of groups, the equivariant triangulations, and the orbifold theory, respectively. The methods are also used to provide two kinds of upper bounds: $d_g(G)\leq |G|$ if $|G|\geq 5$; and $d_g(G)\leq 12(g-1)$ if $g\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theories: Mirror Symmetry and Langlands Duality of $A_\infty$-categories of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-M\"{u}lsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.</description>

      <title>Non-squeezing and other global rigidity results in locally conformal symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using generating functions quadratic at infinity for Lagrangian submanifolds of twisted cotangent bundles, we define spectral selectors for compactly supported lcs Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the locally conformal symplectizations $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ and $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$, and obtain several applications: the construction of a bi-invariant partial order on the group of compactly supported lcs Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ and $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$, of an integer-valued bi-invariant metric on the group of compactly supported lcs Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$, and of an integer-valued lcs capacity for domains of $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$. The lcs capacity is used to prove a lcs non-squeezing theorem in $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ analogous to the contact non-squeezing theorem in $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$ discovered in 2006 by Eliashberg, Kim and Polterovich. Along the way we introduce for Liouville lcs manifolds the notions of essential Lee chords between exact Lagrangian submanifolds and of essential translated points of exact lcs diffeomorphisms. We prove that essential translated points always exist for time-$1$ maps of sufficiently $C^0$-small lcs Hamiltonian isotopies of compact Liouville lcs manifolds and for all compactly supported lcs Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ and $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^{2n} \times S^1$. We also obtain an existence result for essential Lee chords between the zero section of a twisted cotangent bundle with compact base and its image by any lcs Hamiltonian isotopy, which can be thought of as a lcs analogue of the Lagrangian and Legendrian Arnold conjectures on usual cotangent and $1$-jet bundles.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative dimensional reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the multiplicative version of the dimensional reduction theorem in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory. More precisely, we show that the BPS cohomology associated with the loop stack of a $0$-shifted symplectic stack admits a description analogous to orbifold cohomology, even though our stacks are not necessarily Deligne--Mumford. As an application, we propose a new, purely two-dimensional formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for the moduli space of $G$-Higgs bundles, which in turn leads to a formulation of the conjecture for logarithmic $G$-Higgs bundles. We also investigate a twisted version of the multiplicative dimensional reduction, which applies, in particular, to the cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory for $S^1$-bundles over compact oriented surfaces, and more generally to Seifert-fibred $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The metric Rips filtration, universal quasigeodesic cones, and hierarchically hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible, categorical framework for large-scale geometry that clarifies basic behaviour of the metric Rips filtration and streamlines some constructions in geometric group theory. The paper has two main parts. First, we develop the theory of the metric Rips filtration and its colimit in natural coarse categories: informally, we characterise when the Rips colimit produces a canonical large-scale model of a metric space and use this to prove that the quasigeodesic subcategory is closed under colimits in the coarsely Lipschitz category. We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.
  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction. Because the approach is based on universal properties and uniformly controlled coarse data rather than inductive constructions, distance formulae, or hierarchy paths, it applies equally well to arbitrary families of metric spaces equipped with pairwise constraints.</description>

      <title>Sectorial Decompositions of Symmetric Products of Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric products of Riemann surfaces play a crucial role in symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology. Symmetric products of punctured surfaces are Liouville manifolds of interest e.g. for Heegaard Floer theory. We study the symplectic topology of these spaces using Liouville sectorial techniques, along with examples and applications of these decompositions in the context of homological mirror symmetry. More precisely, we show that a sectorial decomposition of a Riemann surface along a union of arcs induces a sectorial decomposition of its second symmetric product and as an application, we give a new geometric proof of Homological Mirror Symmetry for the complex two dimensional pair of pants.</description>

      <title>Excluding cosmetic surgeries on hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs knot invariants and results from hyperbolic geometry to develop a practical procedure for checking the cosmetic surgery conjecture on any given one-cusped manifold. This procedure has been used to establish the following computational results. First, we verify that all knots up to 19 crossings, and all one-cusped 3-manifolds in the SnapPy census, do not admit any purely cosmetic surgeries. Second, we check that a hyperbolic knot with at most 15 crossings only admits chirally cosmetic surgeries when the knot itself is amphicheiral. Third, we enumerate all knots up to 13 crossings that share a common Dehn fillings with the figure-8 knot. The code that verifies these results is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A robot that unknots knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a robot that remembers only the starting position and walks along a knot once on a knot diagram, switching every undercrossing it meets until it returns to the starting position. We observe that the robot produces an ascending diagram, and we provide a new combinatorial proof that every ascending or descending knot diagram can be transformed into the zero-crossing unknot diagram. Using the machinery developed from the combinatorial proof, we show that the minimal number of Reidemeister moves required for such a transformation is bounded above by (7C+1)C if the diagram has C crossings. Moreover, we provide a new alternative proof that there exist sequences of Reidemeister moves that do not increase the number of crossings and transform ascending or descending knot diagrams into zero-crossing unknot diagrams.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>

      <title>XC-tangles and universal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of decorated abstract graphs, that we call XC-tangles, that provides a very convenient framework to study quantum invariants of tangles and virtual tangles. These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{XC}} \rightarrow v\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the "virtual category of elements of $A$". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots.</description>
