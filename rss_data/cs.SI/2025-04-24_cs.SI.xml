      <title>Schelling segregation dynamics in densely-connected social network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schelling segregation is a well-established model used to investigate the dynamics of segregation in agent-based models. Since we consider segregation to be key for the development of political polarisation, we are interested in what insights it could give for this problem. We tested basic questions of segregation on an agent-based social network model where agents' connections were not restricted by their spatial position, and made the network graph much denser than previous tests of Schelling segregation in social networks.
  We found that a dense social network does not become as strongly segregated as a sparse network, and that agents' numbers of same-group neighbours do not greatly exceed their desired numbers (i.e. they do not end up more segregated than they desire to be). Furthermore, we found that the network was very difficult to polarise when one group was somewhat smaller than the other, and that it became unstable when one group was extremely small, both of which provide insights into real-world polarisation dynamics. Finally, we tested the question of whether an increase in the minority group's desire for same-group neighbours created more segregation than a similar increase for the majority group -- the "paradox of weak minority preferences" -- and found mixed evidence for this effect in a densely connected social network.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Social Computing Tools for Undergraduate Research Community Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many barriers exist when new members join a research community, including impostor syndrome. These barriers can be especially challenging for undergraduate students who are new to research. In our work, we explore how the use of social computing tools in the form of spontaneous online social networks (SOSNs) can be used in small research communities to improve sense of belonging, peripheral awareness, and feelings of togetherness within an existing CS research community. Inspired by SOSNs such as BeReal, we integrated a Wizard-of-Oz photo sharing bot into a computing research lab to foster community building among members. Through a small sample of lab members (N = 17) over the course of 2 weeks, we observed an increase in participants' sense of togetherness based on pre- and post-study surveys. Our surveys and semi-structured interviews revealed that this approach has the potential to increase awareness of peers' personal lives, increase feelings of community, and reduce feelings of disconnectedness.</description>

      <title>Media Content Atlas: A Pipeline to Explore and Investigate Multidimensional Media Space using Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital media use continues to evolve and influence various aspects of life, developing flexible and scalable tools to study complex media experiences is essential. This study introduces the Media Content Atlas (MCA), a novel pipeline designed to help researchers investigate large-scale screen data beyond traditional screen-use metrics. Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), MCA enables moment-by-moment content analysis, content-based clustering, topic modeling, image retrieval, and interactive visualizations. Evaluated on 1.12 million smartphone screenshots continuously captured during screen use from 112 adults over an entire month, MCA facilitates open-ended exploration and hypothesis generation as well as hypothesis-driven investigations at an unprecedented scale. Expert evaluators underscored its usability and potential for research and intervention design, with clustering results rated 96% relevant and descriptions 83% accurate. By bridging methodological possibilities with domain-specific needs, MCA accelerates both inductive and deductive inquiry, presenting new opportunities for media and HCI research.</description>

      <title>Debunking with Dialogue? Exploring AI-Generated Counterspeech to Challenge Conspiracy Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterspeech is a key strategy against harmful online content, but scaling expert-driven efforts is challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a potential solution, though their use in countering conspiracy theories is under-researched. Unlike for hate speech, no datasets exist that pair conspiracy theory comments with expert-crafted counterspeech. We address this gap by evaluating the ability of GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Mistral to effectively apply counterspeech strategies derived from psychological research provided through structured prompts. Our results show that the models often generate generic, repetitive, or superficial results. Additionally, they over-acknowledge fear and frequently hallucinate facts, sources, or figures, making their prompt-based use in practical applications problematic.</description>

      <title>Pessimism Traps and Algorithmic Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we relate the philosophical literature on pessimism traps to information cascades, a formal model derived from the economics and mathematics literature. A pessimism trap is a social pattern in which individuals in a community, in situations of uncertainty, begin to copy the sub-optimal actions of others, despite their individual beliefs. This maps nicely onto the concept of an information cascade, which involves a sequence of agents making a decision between two alternatives, with a private signal of the superior alternative and a public history of others' actions. Key results from the economics literature show that information cascades occur with probability one in many contexts, and depending on the strength of the signal, populations can fall into the incorrect cascade very easily and quickly. Once formed, in the absence of external perturbation, a cascade cannot be broken -- therefore, we derive an intervention that can be used to nudge a population from an incorrect to a correct cascade and, importantly, maintain the cascade once the subsidy is discontinued. We study this both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Dense Subgraph Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense subgraph discovery (DSD) is a key graph mining primitive with myriad applications including finding densely connected communities which are diverse in their vertex composition. In such a context, it is desirable to extract a dense subgraph that provides fair representation of the diverse subgroups that constitute the vertex set while incurring a small loss in terms of subgraph density. Existing methods for promoting fairness in DSD have important limitations - the associated formulations are NP-hard in the worst case and they do not provide flexible notions of fairness, making it non-trivial to analyze the inherent trade-off between density and fairness. In this paper, we introduce two tractable formulations for fair DSD, each offering a different notion of fairness. Our methods provide a structured and flexible approach to incorporate fairness, accommodating varying fairness levels. We introduce the fairness-induced relative loss in subgraph density as a price of fairness measure to quantify the associated trade-off. We are the first to study such a notion in the context of detecting fair dense subgraphs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods not only match but frequently outperform existing solutions, sometimes incurring even less than half the subgraph density loss compared to prior art, while achieving the target fairness levels. Importantly, they excel in scenarios that previous methods fail to adequately handle, i.e., those with extreme subgroup imbalances, highlighting their effectiveness in extracting fair and dense solutions.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local communities by concentration of nodes connected with short links are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects robustness of connectivity against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness by modeling planar infrastructure reveals that the robustness is weakened by strong local communities in spatial networks. These results highlight the potential of long-distance links in mitigating the negative effects of local community on the robustness.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Anchor Embedding for Exact Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgraph matching query is a classic problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications, such as discovering structures in biological or chemical networks, finding communities in social network analysis, explaining neural networks, and so on. To further solve the subgraph matching problem, several recent advanced works attempt to utilize deep-learning-based techniques to handle the subgraph matching query. However, most of these works only obtain approximate results for subgraph matching without theoretical guarantees of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework (GNN-AE), which allows exact subgraph matching. Unlike GNN-based approximate subgraph matching approaches that only produce inexact results, in this paper, we pioneer a series of concepts related to anchor (including anchor, anchor graph/path, etc.) in subgraph matching and carefully devise the anchor (graph) embedding technique based on GNN models. We transform the subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space via the anchor (graph &amp; path) embedding techniques. With the proposed anchor matching mechanism, GNN-AE can guarantee subgraph matching has no false dismissals. We design an efficient matching growth algorithm, which can retrieve the locations of all exact matches in parallel. We also propose a cost-model-based DFS query plan to enhance the parallel matching growth algorithm. Through extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our GNN-AE approach for exact subgraph matching.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hashtag recommendation in social media with trend shift detection and adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a key tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and enhancing content categorization and search. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags constantly emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a dynamic hashtag recommendation methodology that employs a trend-aware mechanism to detect shifts in hashtag usage-reflecting evolving trends and topics within social media conversations-and triggers efficient model adaptation based on a (small) set of recent posts. Additionally, the Apache Storm framework is leveraged to support scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data, enabling the timely detection of trend shifts. Experimental results from two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the effectiveness of H-ADAPTS in providing timely and relevant hashtag recommendations by adapting to emerging trends, significantly outperforming existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Noise Reduction in Dense Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Models under Diverging Spiked Eigenvalues Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is one of the most critical problems in modern network science. Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling to social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem of overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to several communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. MMSB provides quite a general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The central question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities given an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the minimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator that matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly general conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory in a series of experiments.</description>
