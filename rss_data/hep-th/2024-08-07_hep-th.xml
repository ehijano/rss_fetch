      <title>Do holographic CFT states have unique semiclassical bulk duals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <title>Rationality of Lorentzian Lattice CFTs And The Associated Modular Tensor Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the rationality of Lorentzian lattice conformal field theory (LLCFT) recently constructed in arXiv:2312.16296 and obtain equivalent characterizations of rationality generalising Wendland's rational Narain CFT characterization. We then describe the construction of a modular tensor category (MTC) associated to rational LLCFTs. We explicitly construct the modular data and braiding and fusing matrices for the MTC. As a concrete example, we show that the LLCFT based on a certain even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice of signature $(m,n)$ with $m$ even realises the $D(m\bmod 8)$ level 1 Kac-Moody MTC.</description>

      <title>Thermal One-point Functions and Their Partial Wave Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we address partial wave decompositions of thermal one-point functions in conformal field theories on $S^1 \times S^{d-1}$. With the help of Casimir differential equations we develop efficient algorithms to compute the relevant conformal blocks for an external field of arbitrary spin and with any spin exchange along the thermal circle, at least in three dimensions. This is achieved by identifying solutions to the Casimir equations with a special class of spherical functions in the harmonic analysis of the conformal group. The resulting blocks are then applied to study the decomposition of one-point functions of the scalar $\phi^2$ and the stress tensor $T$ for a three-dimensional free scalar field $\phi$. We are able to read off averaged OPE coefficients into exchanged fields of high weight and spin for a complete set of tensor structures. We also extract an asymptotic behaviour of conformal blocks and use it to analyse the density of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients for spinning operators, comparing it with semi-classical predictions, such as the dimensions of operators at large charge.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuation and the giant graviton expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is now strong evidence that the superconformal index of holographic gauge theories admits a giant graviton expansion capturing the worldvolume dynamics of spherical D3-branes moving in internal space. While the giant graviton indices may be written as suitable contour integrals, care must be taken in their evaluation, as there can be an ambiguity in choice of integration contour or, equivalently, "pole selection". We resolve this ambiguity by using Murthy's recent expansion of the superconformal index to provide a rigorous underpinning of the evaluation of the supergravity giant graviton indices. In doing so, we directly relate Murthy's giant graviton expansion to the supergravity D3-brane expansion.</description>

      <title>A critical reassessment of "Restricted Weyl Symmetry"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as "restricted Weyl symmetry". However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the "restricted Weyl transformation" to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that "restricted Weyl transformations" are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>Large Landscape of 4d Superconformal Field Theories from Small Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore the space of renormalization group flows of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) triggered by relevant deformations, as well as by coupling to free chiral multiplets with relevant operators. In this way, we classify all possible fixed point SCFTs that can be obtained from certain rank 1 and 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with small amount of matter multiplets, identifying 7,346 inequivalent fixed points which pass a series of non-trivial consistency checks. This set of fixed points exhibits interesting statistical behaviors, including a narrow distribution of central charges $(a, c)$, a correlation between the number of relevant operators and the ratio $a/c$, and trends in the lightest operator dimension versus $a/c$. The ratio $a/c$ of this set is distributed between $0.7228$ and $1.2100$, where the upper bound is larger than that of previously known interacting SCFTs. Moreover, we find a plethora of highly non-perturbative phenomena, such as (super)symmetry enhancements, operator decoupling, non-commuting renormalization group flows, and dualities. We especially identify amongst these fixed points a new SCFT that has smaller central charges $(a, c) = (\frac{633}{2000},\frac{683}{2000})$ than that of the deformed minimal Argyres-Douglas theory, as well as novel Lagrangian duals for certain $\mathcal{N}=1$ deformed Argyres-Douglas theories. We provide a website https://qft.kaist.ac.kr/landscape to navigate through our set of fixed points.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry and modularity in two-modulus K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated in part by the modular properties of enumerative invariants of K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds, we introduce a family of 39 Calabi-Yau mirror pairs $(X,Y)$ with $h_{1,1}(X)=h_{2,1}(Y)=2$, labelled by certain integer quadruples $(m,i,j,s)$ with $m\leq 11$. On the A-model side, $X$ arises as a complete intersection in a projective bundle over a Fano fourfold $V_m^{[i,j]}$, and admits a Tyurin degeneration into a pair of degree $m$ Fano threefolds $F_m^{[i]}\cup F_m^{[j]}$ intersecting on an anticanonical K3 divisor of degree $2m$. On the B-model side, $Y$ is fibered by $M_{m}$-polarized K3-surfaces of Picard rank 19, and determined by a branched covering of $\mathbb{P}^1$, consistent with the Doran-Harder-Thompson mirror conjecture. When $s=0$, $Y$ itself acquires a Tyurin degeneration, and correspondingly $X$ acquires a fibration by degree $2m$ K3 surfaces, such that the two K\"ahler moduli control the size of the K3-fiber and base $\mathbb{P}^1$. While the mirror pairs with $m\leq 4$ can be realized as complete intersections in products of projective spaces or as hypersurfaces in toric varieties, the examples with $m\geq 5$ are intrinsically non-toric. We obtain uniform formulae for the genus 0 and 1 topological free energies near the Tyurin degeneration (mirror to the large base limit), exhibiting modular properties under the Fricke-extended congruence group $\Gamma_0(m)^+$. We use these results to compute the vertical Gopakumar-Vafa and Noether-Lefschetz invariants and check that their generating functions satisfy the expected modular properties. We also compute generating series of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants with fixed non-zero base degree and exhibit their modular properties.</description>

      <title>To $B$ or not to be in single-trace $T\bar T$ holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstring theory on black-strings backgrounds, corresponding to deformed, rotating BTZ black holes, formed by $p$ fundamental strings or negative strings, is inspected. For non-rotating black strings, in the positive case, it was shown in [1] that the excitation energy of a probe long string, plus its contribution to the black-string background, is in harmony with single-trace $T\bar T$ holography, if the $B$-field vanishes at the origin. Here, we investigate the superstring on deformed, rotating BTZ black holes, for both the positive and negative cases, and find that for a particular value of the $B$-field, the harmony with single-trace $T\bar T$ holography persists.</description>

      <title>Flat-Space Limit of Holographic Pseudo Entropy in (A)dS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real part of pseudo entropy in conformal field theories is holographically calculated by the area of some extremal spacelike surfaces in the dual dS and AdS spacetimes. We show that the flat-space limit of these curves in three dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well-defined. We find that if the length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the retarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the entanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is obtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum of retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results suggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual theory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit of pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)ds spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Rotating AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$ and Dyonic Strings from 3-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a general Killing spinor analysis of a particular $D=3, \, N=4$ gauged supergravity that comes from a consistent S$^3$ reduction of $D=6, \, N=(1,0)$ supergravity coupled to a single chiral tensor multiplet. We then focus on its supersymmetric solutions with a null Killing vector and find three new ones. Two of these, namely the null warped AdS$_3$ (also known as the Schr\"odinger spacetime) and the charged domain wall solutions, admit non-trivial gauge fields which give rise to rotating solutions in 6-dimensions. The uplift of the first one produces an interesting AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$ background with a non-trivial rotation in the $U(1)$ fiber direction of the S$^3$ which retains the Schr\"odinger scale invariance that the seed solution has. The second one leads to the well-known rotating dyonic string solution. Finally, the uplift of the third one, which is a domain wall solution with no gauge fields, results in a distribution of dyonic strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider linear perturbations around general Friedmann - Lemaitre - Robertson - Walker (FLRW) cosmological backgrounds. Exploiting gauge freedom involving only time reparametrizations, we write down classical background solutions analytically, for an arbitrary number of fluid components. We then show that the time evolution of scalar and tensor adiabatic perturbations are governed by Schr\"odinger-like differential equations of generalized Heun type. After recovering known analytic results for a single-component fluid, we discuss more general situations with two and three different fluid components, with special attention to the combination of radiation, matter and vacuum energy, which is supposed to describe the $\Lambda$CDM model. The evolution of linear perturbations of a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe is described by a two-transient model, where the transitions from radiation to matter and matter to vacuum energy are governed by a Heun equation and a Hypergeometric equation, respectively. We discuss an analytic approach to the study of the general case, involving generalized Heun equations, that makes use of (quantum) Seiberg-Witten curves for ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories and has proven to be very effective in the analysis of Black-Hole, fuzzball and ECO perturbations.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced birefringence in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed in the leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <title>Can a naked singularity be formed during the gravitational collapse of a Janis-Newman-Winicour solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime possesses a naked singularity, although it represents an exact particle-like solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with a massless scalar field. Here, we investigate the possible formation of a naked singularity in the JNW spacetime, using the thin-shell approximation to describe the gravitational collapse. By introducing different matter contents to construct thin-shells, we demonstrate the impossibility of naked singularity formation during the gravitational collapse unless the causality or null energy condition of the thin-shell is violated. Therefore, the weak cosmic censorship is satisfied even with the naked singularity of the JNW spacetime.</description>

      <title>Splitting amplitudes at N$^3$LO in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit where partons become collinear to each other, scattering amplitudes factorize into a product of universal, process-independent building blocks and scattering amplitudes involving fewer partons. We compute these universal building blocks -- known as splitting amplitudes -- for two collinear QCD partons up to third loop order in QCD. Our results describe arbitrary time-like splitting processes. Due to the violation of strict collinear factorization in space-like splitting processes, we specifically present space-like splitting amplitudes for three-parton QCD scattering amplitudes at third loop order. To achieve our results, we perform a collinear expansion of three-loop scattering amplitudes using a new expansion-by-subgraph technology, which is based on the method of regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$ and $a_e$ a Schwinger parameter. The $``$topological propagator$"$ $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}$d$s_e$ includes a part proportional to d$x_v$ and a part proportional to d$a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

Abstract: The partition function of three dimensional gravity in the quantum regime is dual to the Ising model when the central charge $c=1/2$. Mathematically, we show that the three dimensional gravity can be described by Schramm-Loewner Evolution(SLE) with certain $\kappa$. In fact, SLE depends on the parameter $\kappa$ which controls the diffusion of the Brownian motion. Each value of $c &lt; 1$ corresponds to two values of $\kappa$, which may hint that the three dimensional gravity has two different phases at certain central charge c. Moreover, phase transition is also discussed in AdS and Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the applicability of hydrodynamic expansions close to phase transition points is crucial from either theoretical or phenomenological points of view. We explore this within the gauge/gravity duality, using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon model, a bottom-up string theory construction. This model incorporates a parameter, $B_4$, that simulates different types of phase transitions in the strongly coupled field theory existing at the boundary. We thoroughly examine the thermodynamics and dynamics of time-dependent, linearized perturbations in the spin-2, spin-1, and spin-0 sectors. Our findings suggest that "hydrodynamic series breakdown near transition points" is valid exclusively for second-order phase transitions, not for crossovers or first-order phase transitions. Additionally, we observe that the high-temperature and low-temperature limits of the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic series ($q^2_c$) are equal. We also discover that the relationship $(\text{Max}\vert q^2_c \vert)_{\text{spin-2}} &lt; (\text{Max}\vert q^2_c\vert)_{\text{spin-0}} &lt; (\text{Max}\vert q^2_c \vert)_{\text{spin-1}}$ is consistent for different spin sectors, regardless of the phase transition type. At the chaos point, we observe the emergence of pole-skipping behavior for both gravity and scalar perturbations at $\omega_n = - 2\pi T n i$. Lastly, comparing the chaos momentum with $q^2_c$, we find that $q^2_{ps} &lt; q^2_c$, except for extremely high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Refined Topological Strings and Dual Partition Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the resurgent structure of the refined topological string partition function on a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold, at large orders in the string coupling constant $g_s$ and fixed refinement parameter $\mathsf{b}$. For $\mathsf{b}\neq 1$, the Borel transform admits two families of simple poles, corresponding to integral periods rescaled by $\mathsf{b}$ and $1/\mathsf{b}$. We show that the corresponding Stokes automorphism is expressed in terms of a generalization of the non-compact quantum dilogarithm, and we conjecture that the Stokes constants are determined by the refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants counting spin-$j$ BPS states. This jump in the refined topological string partition function is a special case (unit five-brane charge) of a more general transformation property of wave functions on quantum twisted tori introduced in earlier work by two of the authors. We show that this property follows from the transformation of a suitable refined dual partition function across BPS rays, defined by extending the Moyal star product to the realm of contact geometry.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant phase space methods are applied to the analysis of a causal diamond in 2+1-dimensional pure Einstein gravity. It is found that the reduced phase space is parametrized by a family of charges with a dual geometrical interpretation: they are geometric observables on the corner of the diamond, and they generate diffeomorphisms. The Poisson brackets among them close into an algebra. Knowledge of the corner charges therefore permits reconstruction of the diamond geometry, which realizes a form of local holography. The results are contrasted with the literature, and the path to a quantum description of spacetime geometry is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the group formed by finite renormalizations as an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is demonstrated that for the finite renormalization of the gauge coupling constant its generators $\hat L_n$ with $n\ge 1$ satisfy the commutation relations of the Witt algebra and, therefore, form its subalgebra. The commutation relations are also written for the more general case when finite renormalizations are made for both the coupling constant and matter fields. We also construct the generator of the Abelian subgroup corresponding to the changes of the renormalization scale. The explicit expressions for the renormalization group generators are written in the case when they act on the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension. It is explained how the finite changes of these functions under the finite renormalizations can be obtained with the help of the exponential map.</description>

      <title>Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl) symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity, QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1 dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2 general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1 dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We compute correlation functions of local operator insertions on the 1/2 BPS Wilson lines of N=4 Chern-Simons-matter theories in 3 dimensions. We study the algebra preserved by the defect CFT supported on the line, identify the superdisplacement multiplet and discuss some of its weak-coupling realizations. By employing a superspace description, we present the 4-point functions of the superdisplacement and show how they are determined by functions of cross-ratios. Within an analytic bootstrap approach, we derive these functions at leading and next-to-leading order at strong coupling, obtaining a result in agreement with appropriate orbifolds of the ABJM case considered in arXiv:2004.07849.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation-based protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the higher weak isospin $SU(3)_L$ manifestly unifies dark matter and normal matter in its isomultiplets for which dark matter carries a conserved dark charge while normal matter does not. The resultant gauge symmetry is given by $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_G$, where the first factor is the color group, while the rest defines a theory of scotoelectroweak in which $X$ and $G$ determine electric charge $Q=T_3-1/\sqrt{3}T_8+X$ and dark charge $D=-2/\sqrt{3}T_8+G$. This setup provides both appropriate scotogenic neutrino masses and dark matter stability as preserved by a residual dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$. Interpretation of the dark charge is further discussed, given that $SU(3)_L$ is broken at very high energy scale.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study topology-changing spacetimes occurring from pointlike sources. Following an old idea of Penrose, we will opt for a non-Hausdorff model of topology change in which an initial pointlike source is ``doubled" and allowed to propagate along null rays into an eventual cobordism. By appealing to recent developments in non-Hausdorff differential geometry, we will describe and evaluate gravitational actions on these topology-changing spacetimes. Motivated by analogous results for the Trousers space, we describe a sign convention for Lorentzian angles that will ensure the dampening of our non-Hausdorff topology-changing spacetimes within a two-dimensional path integral for gravity.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

      <title>Monopoles and Fermions in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider all magnetic monopoles that could have settled in the Standard Model after descending from a generic microscopic theory. These monopoles have Standard Model quantum numbers, are stable, and we also require that their magnetic fluxes are consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking. Scattering processes involving quarks, leptons and protons on these monopoles are studied using partial waves decomposition. These processes in the lowest partial wave are known to be unsuppressed by the monopole mass and are relevant for monopole catalysis of proton decay. We provide estimates for scattering cross-sections and investigate and confirm the applicability of the twisted sector approach to scattering processes on these Standard Model monopoles. We find that the SM monopole catalysis processes are universal and model-independent.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>
