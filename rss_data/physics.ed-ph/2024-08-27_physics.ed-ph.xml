      <title>Why is there no Poisson spot in a solar eclipse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson spot is a fascinating lecture demonstration. Its simple explanation can lead to further questions, not only the one posed in the title, but also questions such as why the simple model that considers only light passing just outside the spherical object is successful. The Huygens-Fresnel diffraction model is applied to answer these questions.</description>

      <title>Dominant misconceptions and alluvial flows between Engineering and Physical Science students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool, from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DMs results indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science students on average. However, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the post-test level. This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.</description>
