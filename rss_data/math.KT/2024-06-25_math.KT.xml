      <title>A model structure and Hopf-cyclic theory on the category of coequivariant modules over a comodule algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let H be a coFrobenius Hopf algebra over a field k. Let A be a right H-comodule algebra over k.
  We recall that the category of right H-comodules admits a certain model structure whose homotopy category is equivalent to the stable category of right H-comodules given in Farina's paper. In the first part of this paper, we show that the category of left A-module objects in the category of right H-comodules admits a model structure, which becomes a model subcategory of the category of H*-equivariant A-modules endowed with a model structure given in the author's previous paper if H is finite dimensional with a certain assumption. Note that this category is not a Frobenius category in general. We also construct a functorial cofibrant replacement by proceeding the similar argument as in Qi's paper. In the latter half of this paper, we see that cyclic H-comodules which give Hopf-cyclic (co)homology with coefficients in Hopf H-modules are contructible in the homotopy category of right H-comodules, and we investigate a Hopf-cyclic (co)homology in slightly modified setting by assuming A a right H-comodule k-Hopf algebra with H-colinear bijective antipode in stable category of right H-comodules and give an analogue of the characteristic map. We remark that, as an expansion of an idea of taking trivial comodule k as the coefficients, if we take an A-coinvariant part of M assuming M a Hopf A-module in the category of right H-comodules, we have the degree shift of cyclic modules.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology of Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Deligne conjecture for prestacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the Deligne conjecture for prestacks. We show that given a prestack $\mathbb A$, its Gerstenhaber--Schack complex $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$ is naturally an $E_2$-algebra. This structure generalises both the known $\mathsf{L}_\infty$-algebra structure on $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$, as well as the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on its cohomology $\mathbf{H}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$. The main ingredient is the proof of a conjecture of Hawkins \cite{hawkins}, stating that the homology of the dg operad $\mathsf{Quilt}$ has vanishing homology in positive degrees. As a corollary, $\Quilt$ is quasi-isomorphic to the operad $\mathsf{Brace}$ encoding brace algebras. In addition, we improve the $L_\infty$-structure on $\Quilt$ be showing that it originates from a $\mathsf{PreLie}_\infty$-structure lifting the $\mathsf{PreLie}$-structure on $\mathsf{Brace}$ in homology.</description>

      <title>A resolution theorem for extriangulated categories with applications to the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10576v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quillen's Resolution Theorem in algebraic $K$-theory provides a powerful computational tool for calculating $K$-groups of exact categories. At the level of $K_0$, this result goes back to Grothendieck. In this article, we first establish an extriangulated version of Grothendieck's Resolution Theorem.
  Second, we use this Extriangulated Resolution Theorem to gain new insight into the index theory of triangulated categories. Indeed, we propose an index with respect to an extension-closed subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ and we prove an additivity formula with error term. Our index recovers the index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ defined by J{\o}rgensen and the second author, as well as an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of a relative extriangulated structure $\mathscr{C}_{R}^{\mathscr{X}}$ on $\mathscr{C}$ when $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting. In addition, we generalize and enhance some results of Fedele. Our perspective allows us to remove certain restrictions and simplify some arguments.
  Third, as another application of our Extriangulated Resolution Theorem, we show that if $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting in an abelian category, then the index introduced by Reid gives an isomorphism $K_0(\mathscr{C}_R^{\mathscr{X}}) \cong K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$.</description>

      <title>On blended extensions in filtered tannakian categories and motives with maximal unipotent radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck's theory of blended extensions (extensions panach\'ees) gives a natural framework to study 3-step filtrations in abelian categories. We give a generalization of this theory that is suitable for filtrations with an arbitrary finite number of steps. We use this generalization to study two natural classification problems for objects with a fixed associated graded in a filtered tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. We then give an application to the study of mixed motives with a given associated graded and maximal unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups. We prove a homological classification result for such motives when the given associated graded is "graded-independent", a condition defined in the paper. The special case of this result for motives with 3 weights was proved earlier with K. Murty under some extra hypotheses. The paper also includes some discussions on periods.</description>

      <title>On fibered Burnside rings, fiber change maps and cyclic fiber groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibered Burnside rings appear as Grothendieck rings of fibered permutation representations of a finite group, generalizing Burnside rings and monomial representation rings. Their species, primitive idempotents and their conductors are of particular interest in representation theory as they encode information related to the structure of the group. In this note, we introduce fiber change maps between fibered Burnside rings, and we present results on their functoriality and naturality with respect to biset operations. We present some advances on the conductors for cyclic fiber groups, and fully determine them in particular cases, covering a wide range of interesting examples.</description>
