      <title>NepoIP/MM: Towards Accurate Biomolecular Simulation with a Machine Learning/Molecular Mechanics Model Incorporating Polarization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields offer the ability to simulate biomolecules with quantum mechanical accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, attracting growing attention in biophysics. Meanwhile, leveraging the efficiency of molecular mechanics in modeling solvent molecules and long-range interactions, a hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) model offers a more realistic approach to describing complex biomolecular systems in solution. However, multiscale models with electrostatic embedding require accounting for the polarization of the ML region induced by the MM environment. To address this, we adapt the state-of-the-art NequIP architecture into a polarizable machine learning force field, NepoIP, enabling the modeling of polarization effects based on the external electrostatic potential. We found that the nanosecond MD simulations based on NepoIP/MM are stable for the periodic solvated dipeptide system and the converged sampling shows excellent agreement with the reference QM/MM level. Moreover, we show that a single NepoIP model can be transferable across different MM force fields, as well as extremely different MM environment of water and proteins, laying the foundation for developing a general machine learning biomolecular force field to be used in ML/MM with electrostatic embedding.</description>

      <title>Simple and efficient computational strategies for calculating orbital energies and pair-orbital energies from pCCD-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce affordable computational strategies for calculating orbital and pair-orbital energies in atomic and molecular systems. Our methods are based on the pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant. The computed orbital and pair-orbital energies are then subsequently used to approximate ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA), the resulting charge gaps, double ionization potentials (DIP), and double electron affinities (DEA). Our methodology builds on the standard Koopmans' theorem and extends it for a pCCD-based wave function. Furthermore, we incorporate pCCD electron correlation effects into the model utilizing canonical Hartree-Fock or natural pCCD-optimized orbitals. The latter represents a diagonal approximation to the (D)IP/D(EA) equation of motion pCCD models. We benchmarked our newly developed models against theoretical and available experimental data for selected atoms in various basis set sizes and a set of 24 organic acceptor molecules. Our numerical results show that the Koopmans' approach based on pCCD natural orbitals provides a balanced treatment of occupied and virtual orbital energies, resulting in reliable predictions of charge gaps at a low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Liquid Water Diffusivity at Temperatures near the Glass Transition Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotopically layered amorphous solid water films were used to measure the diffusivity of deeply supercooled liquid water near the glass transition. The films, composed of separate layers of oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 labeled water, were grown by vapor deposition at low temperature and then heated to observe the intermixing of the isotopic layers. Very slow heating rates (as low as 0.0001 K/s) were used to decouple the diffusion and crystallization processes to ensure that the observed intermixing occurred at temperatures that were well-separated from the onset of crystallization. Numerical simulations of the desorption spectra were used to extract the translational diffusivities. The diffusivities obtained in this paper are consistent with translational liquid-like motion at temperatures near and above the proposed Tg of 136 K. These findings support the idea that the melt of amorphous water, above its glass transition temperature is thermodynamically continuous with normal supercooled liquid.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be manipulated with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not lead to resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory of Charged Excitations With Consistent Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for simulating spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation in charged electronic states and photoelectron spectra. Our implementation supports Hartree-Fock and multiconfigurational reference wavefunctions, enabling efficient correlated calculations of relativistic effects using single-reference (SR-) and multireference (MR-) ADC. We combine the SR- and MR-ADC methods with three flavors of spin-orbit two-component Hamiltonians and benchmark their performance for a variety of atoms and small molecules. When multireference effects are not important, the SR-ADC approximations are competitive in accuracy to MR-ADC, often showing closer agreement with experimental results. However, for electronic states with multiconfigurational character and in non-equilibrium regions of potential energy surfaces, the MR-ADC methods are more reliable, predicting accurate excitation energies and zero-field splittings. Our results demonstrate that the spin-orbit ADC methods are promising approaches for interpreting and predicting the results of modern spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Are we making much progress? Revisiting chemical reaction yield prediction from an imbalanced regression perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The yield of a chemical reaction quantifies the percentage of the target product formed in relation to the reactants consumed during the chemical reaction. Accurate yield prediction can guide chemists toward selecting high-yield reactions during synthesis planning, offering valuable insights before dedicating time and resources to wet lab experiments. While recent advancements in yield prediction have led to overall performance improvement across the entire yield range, an open challenge remains in enhancing predictions for high-yield reactions, which are of greater concern to chemists. In this paper, we argue that the performance gap in high-yield predictions results from the imbalanced distribution of real-world data skewed towards low-yield reactions, often due to unreacted starting materials and inherent ambiguities in the reaction processes. Despite this data imbalance, existing yield prediction methods continue to treat different yield ranges equally, assuming a balanced training distribution. Through extensive experiments on three real-world yield prediction datasets, we emphasize the urgent need to reframe reaction yield prediction as an imbalanced regression problem. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating simple cost-sensitive re-weighting methods can significantly enhance the performance of yield prediction models on underrepresented high-yield regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>
