      <title>StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In volume visualization, visualization synthesis has attracted much attention due to its ability to generate novel visualizations without following the conventional rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.</description>

      <title>DiM-Gesture: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Adaptive Layer Normalization Mamba-2 framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation is an emerging domain within virtual human creation, where current methods predominantly utilize Transformer-based architectures that necessitate extensive memory and are characterized by slow inference speeds. In response to these limitations, we propose \textit{DiM-Gestures}, a novel end-to-end generative model crafted to create highly personalized 3D full-body gestures solely from raw speech audio, employing Mamba-based architectures. This model integrates a Mamba-based fuzzy feature extractor with a non-autoregressive Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) Mamba-2 diffusion architecture. The extractor, leveraging a Mamba framework and a WavLM pre-trained model, autonomously derives implicit, continuous fuzzy features, which are then unified into a singular latent feature. This feature is processed by the AdaLN Mamba-2, which implements a uniform conditional mechanism across all tokens to robustly model the interplay between the fuzzy features and the resultant gesture sequence. This innovative approach guarantees high fidelity in gesture-speech synchronization while maintaining the naturalness of the gestures. Employing a diffusion model for training and inference, our framework has undergone extensive subjective and objective evaluations on the ZEGGS and BEAT datasets. These assessments substantiate our model's enhanced performance relative to contemporary state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competitive outcomes with the DiTs architecture (Persona-Gestors) while optimizing memory usage and accelerating inference speed.</description>

      <title>Neural Octahedral Field: Octahedral prior for simultaneous smoothing and sharp edge regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of distance function as a coordinate neural field, has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. To enforce consistent orientation, existing methods focus on regularizing the gradient of the distance function, such as constraining it to be of the unit norm, minimizing its divergence, or aligning it with the eigenvector of Hessian that corresponds to zero eigenvalue. However, under the presence of large scanning noise, they tend to either overfit the noise input or produce an excessively smooth reconstruction. In this work, we propose to guide the surface reconstruction under a new variant of neural field, the octahedral field, leveraging the spherical harmonics representation of octahedral frames originated in the hexahedral meshing. Such field automatically snaps to geometry features when constrained to be smooth, and naturally preserves sharp angles when interpolated over creases. By simultaneously fitting and smoothing the octahedral field alongside the implicit geometry, it behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting in smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges. Despite being operated purely pointwise, our method outperforms various traditional and neural approaches across extensive experiments, and is very competitive with methods that require normal and data priors.

      <title>Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.</description>

      <title>SF3D: Stable Fast 3D Mesh Reconstruction with UV-unwrapping and Illumination Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SF3D, a novel method for rapid and high-quality textured object mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike most existing approaches, SF3D is explicitly trained for mesh generation, incorporating a fast UV unwrapping technique that enables swift texture generation rather than relying on vertex colors. The method also learns to predict material parameters and normal maps to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed 3D meshes. Furthermore, SF3D integrates a delighting step to effectively remove low-frequency illumination effects, ensuring that the reconstructed meshes can be easily used in novel illumination conditions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SF3D over the existing techniques. Project page: https://stable-fast-3d.github.io</description>

      <title>MotionFix: Text-Driven 3D Human Motion Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is 3D motion editing. Given a 3D human motion and a textual description of the desired modification, our goal is to generate an edited motion as described by the text. The challenges include the lack of training data and the design of a model that faithfully edits the source motion. In this paper, we address both these challenges. We build a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets in the form of (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, and create the new MotionFix dataset. Having access to such data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We further build various baselines trained only on text-motion pairs datasets, and show superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing and establish a new benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix. Our results are encouraging, paving the way for further research on finegrained motion generation. Code and models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>TurboEdit: Text-Based Image Editing Using Few-Step Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have opened the path to a wide range of text-based image editing frameworks. However, these typically build on the multi-step nature of the diffusion backwards process, and adapting them to distilled, fast-sampling methods has proven surprisingly challenging. Here, we focus on a popular line of text-based editing frameworks - the ``edit-friendly'' DDPM-noise inversion approach. We analyze its application to fast sampling methods and categorize its failures into two classes: the appearance of visual artifacts, and insufficient editing strength. We trace the artifacts to mismatched noise statistics between inverted noises and the expected noise schedule, and suggest a shifted noise schedule which corrects for this offset. To increase editing strength, we propose a pseudo-guidance approach that efficiently increases the magnitude of edits without introducing new artifacts. All in all, our method enables text-based image editing with as few as three diffusion steps, while providing novel insights into the mechanisms behind popular text-based editing approaches.</description>

      <title>Perm: A Parametric Representation for Multi-Style 3D Hair Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Perm, a learned parametric model of human 3D hair designed to facilitate various hair-related applications. Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair shape and local strand details, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair modeling process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of \textsc{Perm}, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as 3D hair parameterization, hairstyle interpolation, single-view hair reconstruction, and hair-conditioned image generation. Our code and data will be available at: https://github.com/c-he/perm.</description>
