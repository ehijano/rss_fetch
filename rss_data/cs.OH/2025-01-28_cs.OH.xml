      <title>Integration of IoT- AI powered local weather forecasting: A Game-Changer for Agriculture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic environment context necessitates harnessing digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to supply high-resolution, real-time meteorological data to support agricultural decision-making and improve overall farm productivity and sustainability. This study investigates the potential application of various AI-powered, IoT-based, low-cost platforms for local weather forecasting to enable smart farming. Despite the increasing demand for this topic, a few promising studies have explored this area. This paper developed a conceptual research framework based on a systematic review of relevant literature and employed a case study method to validate the framework. The framework comprised five key components: the Data Acquisition Layer, Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Application Layer, and Decision-Making Layer. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the integration of AI-ML and IoT techniques for weather prediction tasks to support agriculture, and the incorporation of IoT technologies that provide real-time, high-resolution meteorological data, representing a step forward. Furthermore, this paper discusses key research gaps, such as the significant obstacles impeding the adoption of AI in agriculture and local weather forecasting, including the lack of straightforward solutions and the lack of digital skills among farmers, particularly those in rural areas. Further empirical research is needed to enhance the existing frameworks and address these challenges.</description>
