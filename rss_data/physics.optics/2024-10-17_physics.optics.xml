      <title>Structured Light-Matter Interaction: Twisted Photons in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a numerical framework for studying the interaction of structured electromagnetic fields, i.e., light pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), interacting with a single layer of graphene. Our approach is based on a two-step process, where first the interaction of structured light with matter, modelled by a suitable Dirac equation is solved and then coupled with Maxwell's equations, for studying the properties in both space and frequency domain of the generated nonlinear electromagnetic field. As an example of application of our method we investigate third harmonic generation by an OAM pulse. We check that OAM conservation through harmonic generation is conserved, and we report on both the spatial and frequency features of the third harmonic signal, comparing it with the traditional frequency response for spatially uniform field.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation from subwavelength silicon films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant developments in the study of nonlinear properties of various optical materials at the nanoscale. However, in most cases experimental results on harmonic generation from nanostructured materials are reported without the benefit of suitable theoretical models and appropriate comparisons to assess enhancement of conversion efficiencies compared to the intrinsic properties of a given material. Here, we report experimental observations of even and odd optical harmonics generated from a suspended subwavelength silicon film, a dielectric membrane, up to the 7th harmonic tuned deep in the UV range at 210nm, which is the current limit of our detection system, using peak power densities of order 3TW/cm^2. We explain the experimental data with a time domain, hydrodynamic-Maxwell approach broadly applicable to most materials. Our approach accounts simultaneously for surface and magnetic nonlinearities that generate even optical harmonics, as well as linear and nonlinear material dispersions beyond the third order to account for odd optical harmonics, plasma formation, and a phase locking mechanism that makes the generation of high harmonics possible deep into the UV range, where semiconductors like silicon start operating in a metallic regime.</description>

      <title>Triangular cross-section grating couplers for integrated quantum nanophotonic hardware in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular cross-section nanodevices are among the leading approaches for integrating color centers with photonics for applications in quantum information processing. We design periodic and aperiodic fishbone triangular grating couplers in silicon carbide. We optimize the designs for achieving up to $\sim$ 31% collection efficiency from color center integrated triangular devices to a microscopy system. Using an ion beam angle etching process, we demonstrate proof-of-principle fabrication of the designed devices for future implementation in wafer-scale quantum nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Scale Atomic Manufacturing: Heterodyne Grating Interferometer with Zero Dead-Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel heterodyne grating interferometer designed to meet the precise measurement requirements of next-generation lithography systems and large-scale atomic-level manufacturing. Utilizing a dual-frequency light source, the interferometer enables simultaneous measurement of three degrees of freedom. Key advancements include a compact zero Dead-Zone optical path configuration, significantly enhancing measurement reliability by mitigating the impact of light source fluctuations and air refractive index variations. A comprehensive crosstalk error analysis was conducted, resulting in a robust correction algorithm that reduces errors to below 5%. Performance testing of the prototype, size of 90mm*90mm*40mm, demonstrated exceptional resolution (0.25 nm in the XY-axis and 0.3 nm in the Z-axis), superior linearity (6.9e-5, 8.1e-5 and 16.2e-5 for the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively), high repeatability (0.8 nm/1000 nm for the three axes) and stability (20 nm for the XY-axis and 60 nm for the Z-axis over 1000 seconds). Comparative analysis with existing measurement sensors highlights the proposed method's significant advantages in integration, multidimensional capabilities, and is expected to be widely used in fields such as integrated circuits, atomic-level manufacturing and aerospace technology.</description>

      <title>Soft-Matter-Based Topological Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized topological vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), as stable and efficient on-chip light sources, play an important role in the next generation of optical storage and optical communications. However, most current topological lasers demand complex design and expensive fabrication processes, and their semiconductor-based structures pose challenges for flexible device applications. By use of an analogy with two-dimensional Semenov insulators in synthetic parametric space, we design and realize a one-dimensional optical superlattice (stacked polymerized cholesteric liquid crystal films and Mylar films), thereby we demonstrate a flexible, low threshold, circularly polarized topological VCSEL with high slope efficiency. We show that such a laser maintains a good single-mode property under low pump power and inherits the transverse spatial profile of the pump laser. Thanks to the soft-matter-based flexibility, our topological VCSEL can be "attached" to substrates of various shapes, enabling desired laser properties and robust beam steering even after undergoing hundreds of bends. Our results may find applications in consumer electronics, laser scanning and displays, as well as wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Physically transparent diffractive optical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by neural network algorithms in deep learning, diffractive optical networks have arisen as new platforms for manipulating light-matter interactions. Seemly inherited from the deep learning black box nature, clear physical meanings have never been given for these complex diffractive networks at the layer level, even though the systems are visible in physical space. Using exemplified mode conversion systems, this work showed how various physical transformation rules within diffractive networks can be unveiled with properly defined input/output relations. Surprising physical transformation division phenomenon and an optical analogy of gradient-vanishing-effect have been observed and discussed for high-dimensional mode sorting tasks. The use of physical transparency for the effective design of parameter-varying networks is also demonstrated. These physically transparent optical networks resolve the contradiction between rigorous physical theorem and operationally vague network structure, and pave the way for transparentizing other physical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Superoscillation focusing of high-order cylindrical-vector beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional superoscillation focusing typically requires complex optimization of the incident light field. These complexities may limit the practical application of superoscillation. High-order radially polarized Laguerre-Gaussian beams inherently support superoscillation focusing due to their multi-ring amplitude distribution and 0 ~ \pi phase alternation, which align with the necessary destructive interference mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that by adjusting the beam mode order together with the incident beam size, we can easily control the full width at half maximum, field of view, and energy distribution of superoscillation focusing. Moreover, high-order azimuthally polarized vortex-phase Laguerre-Gaussian beams can also achieve superoscillation focusing, offering even better super-resolution effects. The distinct focusing behaviors of their circular components present unique opportunities for applications involving circular dichroism materials.</description>

      <title>Broadband millimeter-wave frequency mixer based on thin-film lithium niobate photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency mixers are fundamental components in modern wireless communication and radar systems, responsible for up- and down-conversion of target radio-frequency (RF) signals. Recently, photonic-assisted RF mixers have shown unique advantages over traditional electronic counterparts, including broad operational bandwidth, flat frequency response, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, current integrated photonic mixers face significant challenges in achieving efficient conversion at high frequencies, especially in millimeter-wave bands, due to the limitations of existing electro-optic (EO) modulators. Additionally, high-frequency local oscillators in the millimeter-wave range are often difficult to obtain and expensive, leading to unsatisfactory cost and restricted operational bandwidth in practice. In this paper, we harness the exceptional EO property and scalability of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform to implement a high-performance harmonic reconfigurable millimeter-wave mixer. The TFLN photonic circuit integrates a broadband EO modulator that allows for extensive frequency coverage, and an EO frequency comb source that significantly reduces the required carrier frequency of the local oscillator. We experimentally demonstrate fully reconfigurable frequency down-conversion across a broad operational bandwidth ranging from 20 GHz to 67 GHz, with a large intermediate frequency of 20 GHz, as well as up-conversion to frequencies of up to 110 GHz. Our integrated photonic mixing system shows dramatically improved bandwidth performance, along with competitive indicators of frequency conversion efficiency and spurious suppression ratio, positioning it as a promising solution for future millimeter-wave transceivers in next-generation communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Approximations of MINFLUX Localization Precision with Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technology that measures the position of single fluorophores with nanometer precision using fewer photons than any other fluorescence imaging or tracking technique. Here, we derive simple and instructive analytical equations for MINFLUX localization precision with a special focus on background photons. A fluorescence background, either arising from an imperfect zero of the MINFLUX excitation point spread function (PSF) or from auto- or out-of-focus fluorescence, ultimately limits the resolution achievable with MINFLUX. Building on previous work, we try to improve our understanding of the influence of background, especially when it is unknown, through a new set of expressions for the localization precision, based on an explicit background term instead of signal-to-background ratio. We use these equations to generate an intuitive understanding of how fluorescence background affects MINFLUX measurements and illustrate that:
  - The precision of an emitter position estimate depends on the gradient of its excitation profile.
  - Knowledge of the fluorescence background, obtained during post-processing of MINFLUX traces or through separate measurements, provides a better localization precision than in the case of unknown background.
  - In diffraction-limited systems, localization with a PSF that features a near-zero minimum outperforms localization with a maximum.
  We also present an analytical expression for the localization precision in orbital tracking, which we use for comparison to MINFLUX.</description>

      <title>Versatile Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography with Adjustable Transmission-to-Reflection Ratio and Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) is effective for rapid cross-sectional imaging but often suffers from incoherent signals due to imbalanced light intensities between the sample and reference arms. While the high-throughput dark-field (HTDF) FF-OCT technique employs an asymmetric beamsplitter (BS) to achieve an asymmetric beam-splitting ratio and optimize the utilization of available light, the fixed beam-splitting ratio in the optical system limits HTDF FF-OCT to effectively measuring only specific types of samples with certain scattering intensities. To address this limitation, we propose a more versatile FF-OCT system with an adjustable transmission-to-reflection ratio. This system enables accurate measurement across a broader range of samples by optimizing the light source and finely tuning the polarization to achieve the ideal ratio for different materials. We also observed that both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and imaging depth are influenced by the beam-splitting ratio. By precisely adjusting the beam-splitting ratio, both SNR and imaging depth can be optimized to achieve their optimal values.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D and "1.5D" problems (in the latter, fields and wave vectors generally have two components, while the mathematical equations can still be reduced to 1D). The 2D Maxwell case, however, is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are fully consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as was also shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>Thermal analysis of GaN-based photonic membranes for optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor membranes find their widespread use in various research fields targeting medical, biological, environmental, and optical applications. Often such membranes derive their functionality from an inherent nanopatterning, which renders the determination of their, e.g., optical, electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties a challenging task. In this work we demonstrate the non-invasive, all-optical thermal characterization of around 800-nm-thick and 150-$\mu$m-wide membranes that consist of wurtzite GaN and a stack of In$_{0.15}$Ga$_{0.85}$N quantum wells as a built-in light source. Due to their application in photonics such membranes are bright light emitters, which challenges their non-invasive thermal characterization by only optical means. As a solution, we combine two-laser Raman thermometry with (time-resolved) photoluminescence measurements to extract the in-plane (i.e., $c$-plane) thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}$ of our membranes. Based on this approach, we can disentangle the entire laser-induced power balance during our thermal analysis, meaning that all fractions of reflected, scattered, transmitted, and reemitted light are considered. As a result of our thermal imaging via Raman spectroscopy, we obtain $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}\,=\,165^{+16}_{-14}\,$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for our best membrane, which compares well to our simulations yielding $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}\,=\,177\,$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ based on an ab initio solution of the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Our work presents a promising pathway towards thermal imaging at cryogenic temperatures, e.g., when aiming to elucidate experimentally different phonon transport regimes via the recording of non-Fourier temperature distributions.</description>

      <title>Contact-interference Hybrid lithography: Toward Scalable Fabrication of cross-scale periodic micro structure and demonstration on infrared micro polarizer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength grating micro-polarizer arrays, as a type of focal plane division simultaneous detection method, are significantly advancing the development and practical application of polarization imaging technology. Based on the cross-scale, dual-period characteristics of the grating array, this paper proposes a fabrication method that combines laser interference lithography with contact lithography. This method constructs a complete single-layer micro-polarizer array photoresist pattern through a four-step lithography process. Compared to traditional point-by-point fabrication methods like EBL and FIB, the patterning time is reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, by introducing a refractive index matching liquid and an alignment method based on substrate contours, the effects of gaps and splicing errors are minimized, resulting in high-quality photoresist patterns with splicing errors less than 1{\mu}m. Finally, a double-layer metal grating structure was obtained through pattern transfer. Performance tests show that the micro-polarizer array achieves a maximum transmittance of over 50% and an extinction ratio exceeding 15dB in the 3-15{\mu}m wavelength range. This exploration offers a low-cost, high-efficiency path for fabricating micro-polarizer arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new heterostructure based on the hybridization of graphene-LiF layers with a nonlinear material is introduced and studied. The numerical results are depicted and discussed in detail. A high value of FOM (FOM=24.5) at the frequency of 9.22 THz is reported for the chemical potential of 0.2 ev. Our results show that the propagation features of the proposed structure can be varied by the graphene parameters and the nonlinearity inside and outside the phononic band. The Hybridization of graphene with a nonlinear medium and a polar dielectric like LiF can support high levels of confinement with low optical loss, which makes this platform a unique candidate for THz applications.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via media diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Signal Enhancement in Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Using a Guided Unsupervised Deep Learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a promising technology introducing a new paradigm in the acquisition of high-resolution seismic data. However, DAS data often show weak signals compared to the background noise, especially in tough installation environments. In this study, we propose a new approach to denoise DAS data that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) model, eliminating the need for labeled training data. The DL model aims to reconstruct the DAS signal while simultaneously attenuating DAS noise. The input DAS data undergo band-pass filtering to eliminate high-frequency content. Subsequently, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is performed, and the finest scale is used to guide the DL model in reconstructing the DAS signal. First, we extract 2D patches from both the band-pass filtered data and the CWT scale of the data. Then, these patches are converted using an unrolling mechanism into 1D vectors to form the input of the DL model. The architecture of the proposed DL network is composed of several fully-connected layers. A self-attention layer is further included in each layer to extract the spatial relation between the band-pass filtered data and the CWT scale. Through an iterative process, the DL model tunes its parameters to suppress DAS noise, with the band-pass filtered data serving as the target for the network. We employ the log cosh as a loss function for the DL model, enhancing its robustness against erratic noise. The denoising performance of the proposed framework is validated using field examples from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) and Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) datasets, where the data are recorded by a fiber-optic cable. Comparative analyses against three benchmark methods reveal the robust denoising performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical results on the accuracy of fiber-longitudinal optical power monitoring (LPM) at arbitrary positions. To quantify the accuracy, the position-wise variance and power-profile SNR of LPM are defined and analyzed, yielding formulas for these metrics. Using these metrics, we show that various designs and performance predictions of LPM for a given link and estimation conditions are possible in a unified manner. Specifically, the required SNR to detect a given loss event is first presented. Based on this, the design parameters of LPM, such as the sample size and optical power required to detect the loss, are explicitly determined. The performance such as the detectable limit of loss events at individual positions and maximum dynamic range are also specified. These results can be used as a basis for establishing a design principle of LPM.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and vortices in a tri-core nonlinear fractional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a waveguiding system composed of three linearly-coupled fractional waveguides, with a triangular (prismatic) transverse structure. It may be realized as a tri-core nonlinear optical fiber with fractional group-velocity dispersion (GVD), or, possibly, as a system of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations for a set of three tunnel-coupled cigar-shaped traps filled by a Bose-Einstein condensate of particles moving by L\'evy flights. The analysis is focused on the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) between components of triple solitons, and the formation and stability of vortex modes. In the self-focusing regime, we identify symmetric and asymmetric soliton states, whose structure and stability are determined by the L\'evy index of the fractional GVD, the inter-core coupling strength, and the total energy, which determines the system's nonlinearity. Bifurcation diagrams (of the supercritical type) reveal regions where SSB occurs, identifying the respective symmetric and asymmetric ground-state soliton modes. In agreement with the general principle of the SSB theory, the solitons with broken inter-component symmetry prevail with the increase of the energy in the weakly-coupled system. Three-components vortex solitons (which do not feature SSB) are studied too. Because the fractional GVD breaks the system's Galilean invariance, we also address mobility of the vortex solitons, by applying a boost to them.</description>

      <title>High detectivity terahertz radiation sensing using frequency-noise-optimized nanomechanical resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We achieve high detectivity terahertz sensing using a silicon nitride nanomechanical resonator functionalized with a metasurface absorber. High performances are achieved by striking a fine balance between the frequency stability of the resonator, and its responsivity to absorbed radiation. Using this approach, we demonstrate a detectivity $D^*=3.4\times10^9~\mathrm{cm\cdot\sqrt{Hz}/W}$ and a noise equivalent power $\mathrm{NEP}=36~\mathrm{pW/\sqrt{Hz}}$ that outperform the best room-temperature on-chip THz detectors (i.e., pyroelectrics). Our optical absorber consists of a 1-mm diameter metasurface, which currently enables a 0.5-3 THz detection range but can easily be scaled to other frequencies in the THz and infrared ranges. In addition to demonstrating high-performance terahertz sensing, our work unveils an important fundamental trade-off between high frequency stability and high responsivity in thermal-based nanomechanical radiation sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear, i.e., multi-photon microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging deep into biological tissues. Its penetration depth can be increased further using adaptive optics. In this work, we present a fast, feedback-based adaptive-optics algorithm, termed C-DASH, for multi-photon imaging through multiply-scattering media. C-DASH utilises complex-valued light shaping (i.e., joint shaping of amplitude and phase), which offers several advantages over phase-only techniques: it converges faster, it delivers higher image quality enhancement, it shows a robust performance largely insensitive to the axial position of the correction plane, and it has a higher ability to cope with, on the one hand, scattering media that vary over time and, on the other hand, scattering media that are partially absorbing. Furthermore, our method is practically self-aligning. We also present a simple way to implement C-DASH using a single reflection off a phase-only spatial light modulator. We provide a thorough characterisation of our method, presenting results of numerical simulations as well as two-photon excited fluorescence imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>A new matrix representation of the Maxwell equations based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber vector for a linear inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a new eight dimensional matrix representation of the Maxwell equations for a linear homogeneous medium and extend it to the case of a linear inhomogneous medium. This derivation starts ab initio with the Maxwell equations and uses arguments based on the algebra of the Pauli matrices. This process leads automatically to the matrix representation based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber (RSW) vector. The new representation for the homogeneous medium is a direct sum of four Pauli matrix blocks. This aspect of the new representation should make it suitable for studying the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a linear inhomogeneous medium adopting the techniques of quantum mechanics treating the inhomogeneity as a perturbation. The new representation is used to rederive the Mukunda-Simon-Sudarshan matrix substitution rule for transition from the Helmholtz scalar wave optics to the Maxwell vector wave optics.</description>

      <title>Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. The linewidth of the laser lock is ~0.8 MHz and ~1.8 MHz in the presence and in the absence of the external magnetic field, respectively. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>
