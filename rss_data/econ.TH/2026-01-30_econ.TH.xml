      <title>Compromise by "multimatum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a solution and a mechanism for two-agent social choice problems with large (infinite) policy spaces. Our solution is an efficient compromise rule between the two agents, built on a common cardinalization of their preferences. Our mechanism, the \emph{multimatum} has the two players alternate in proposing sets of alternatives from which the other must choose. Our main result shows that the multimatum fully implements our compromise solution in subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. \\ We demonstrate the power and versatility of this approach through applications to political economy, other-regarding preferences, and facility location.</description>

      <title>Characteristics Design: A Hedonic Approach to Optimal Product Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the generalized hedonic-linear model of Pellegrino (2025), this paper studies optimal product differentiation when a representative consumer has preferences over product characteristics. Under multiproduct monopoly, the monopolist's choice of product characteristics is always aligned with the social planner's optimum, despite underproduction. By contrast, under oligopoly, multiple equilibria can arise that differ qualitatively in their patterns of characteristics design. We show that, while oligopoly equilibria exhibiting product differentiation yield higher welfare than those with product concentration, the degree of product differentiation under oligopoly remains below the socially optimal level. As a result, social welfare under oligopoly is typically lower than under monopoly, highlighting a key advantage of coordination in characteristics design. We extend the analysis to settings with overlapping ownership structures and show that common ownership can improve welfare by inducing firms to soften competition through increased product differentiation rather than output reduction.</description>

      <title>The Economics of No-regret Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge for modern economics is to understand what happens when actors in an economy are replaced with algorithms. Like rationality has enabled understanding of outcomes of classical economic actors, no-regret can enable the understanding of outcomes of algorithmic actors. This review article covers the classical computer science literature on no-regret algorithms to provide a foundation for an overview of the latest economics research on no-regret algorithms, focusing on the emerging topics of manipulation, statistical inference, and algorithmic collusion.</description>

      <title>Distributional Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study symmetric competitions in which each player chooses an arbitrary distribution over a one-dimensional performance index, subject to a convex cost. I establish existence of a symmetric equilibrium, document various properties it must possess, and provide a characterization via the first-order approach. Manifold applications--to R&amp;D competition, oligopolistic competition with product design, and rank-order contests--follow.</description>

      <title>Decision theory and the "almost implies near" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine behavioral axioms in decision theory that are satisfied approximately rather than exactly. We demonstrate that in key domains -- decisions under risk, uncertainty, and intertemporal choice -- behavior that \emph{almost} satisfies an axiom implies the existence of a utility function that is \emph{near} one that adheres to the standard theoretical representation (e.g., expected utility, or exponentially discounted utility). We explicitly quantify the distance between the utility that captures actual behavior and the ideal theoretical utility as a function of the measured deviation from the axiom. This result formally connects two distinct quantitative exercises: measuring empirical deviations from theory and utilizing approximate optimization. Effectively, we show that small deviations from behavioral axioms rationalize the use of standard models as valid approximations.</description>

      <title>Network Heterogeneity and Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does greater connectivity enhance the value of public information? I study a networked beauty contest game where agents balance adaptation to the fundamental with local coordination. The analysis reveals a stark non-monotonicity: while public disclosure improves welfare when interactions are uniform, regardless of their intensity, it can be detrimental in core-periphery structures. This welfare loss stems from a distortion driven by the core, where core agents over-respond to a noisy public signal, forcing peripheral neighbors to absorb this volatility to maintain alignment. These findings suggest that standard transparency policies can backfire in tiered markets where dominant hubs propagate excess volatility.</description>

      <title>Task assignment as dynamic incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study repeated assignment of a task among workers as an incentive instrument for effort. Unlike traditional instruments, task assignment is inseparable from production and rivalrous: it both provides incentives and determines who produces, while necessarily excluding others. We show that workers are optimally assigned the task through a strict, evolving priority ranking. In every continuation, workers' expected average workloads differ, even when they are technologically independent and symmetric in all aspects. Consequently, our results highlight that the efficiency-equality tension is more pervasive than previously recognized. We further examine design instruments that expand the scope of efficiency without aggravating worker inequality.\bigskip</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive or negative involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding some set of up to $n$ voters). This impossibility theorem holds for any positive integer $n$. In addition, positive involvement can be replaced by negative involvement (if a candidate $x$ loses in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely last cannot cause $x$ to win). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of von Neumann's Reduction from the Assignment Problem to Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equivalence between von Neumann's Minimax Theorem for zero-sum games and the LP Duality Theorem connects cornerstone problems of the two fields of game theory and optimization, respectively, and has been the subject of intense scrutiny for seven decades. Yet, as observed in this paper, the proof of the difficult direction of this equivalence is unsatisfactory: It does not assign distinct roles to the two players of the game, as is natural from the definition of a zero-sum game.
  In retrospect, a partial resolution to this predicament was provided in another brilliant paper of von Neumann, which reduced the assignment problem to zero-sum games. However, the underlying LP is highly specialized; all entries of its objective function vector are strictly positive, the constraint vector is all ones, and the constraint matrix is 0/1.
  We generalize von Neumann's result along two directions, each allowing negative entries in certain parts of the LP. Our reductions make explicit the roles of the two players of the reduced game, namely their maximin strategies are to play optimal solutions to the primal and dual LPs. Furthermore, unlike previous reductions, the value of the reduced game reveals the value of the given LP. Our generalizations encompass several basic economic scenarios.</description>
