      <title>Fictitious Play in Extensive-Form Games of Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the fictitious play process in repeated extensive-form games of imperfect information with perfect recall. Each player maintains incorrect beliefs that the moves at all information sets, except the one at which the player is about to make a move, are made according to fixed random strategies, independently across all information sets. Accordingly, each player makes his moves at any of his information sets to maximize his expected payoff assuming that, at any other information set, the moves are made according to the empirical frequencies of the past moves. We extend the well-known Monderer-Shapley result [1] on the convergence of the empirical frequencies to the set of Nash equilibria to a certain class of extensive-form games with identical interests. We then strengthen this result by the use of inertia and fading memory, and prove the convergence of the realized play-paths to an essentially pure Nash equilibrium in all extensive-form games of imperfect information with identical interests.</description>

      <title>A Composable Game-Theoretic Framework for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchains rely on economic incentives to ensure secure and decentralised operation, making incentive compatibility a core design concern. However, protocols are rarely deployed in isolation. Applications interact with the underlying consensus and network layers, and multiple protocols may run concurrently on the same chain. These interactions give rise to complex incentive dynamics that traditional, isolated analyses often fail to capture.
  We propose the first compositional game-theoretic framework for blockchain protocols. Our model represents blockchain protocols as interacting games across layers -- application, network, and consensus. It enables formal reasoning about incentive compatibility under composition by introducing two key abstractions: the cross-layer game, which models how strategies in one layer influence others, and cross-application composition, which captures how application protocols interact concurrently through shared infrastructure.
  We illustrate our framework through case studies on HTLCs, Layer-2 protocols, and MEV, showing how compositional analysis reveals subtle incentive vulnerabilities and supports modular security proofs.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bound for Multicolor Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the following asymptotically tight lower bound for $k$-color discrepancy: For any $k \geq 2$, there exists a hypergraph with $n$ vertices such that its $k$-color discrepancy is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This improves on the previously known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log k})$ due to Caragiannis et al. (arXiv:2502.10516). As an application, we show that our result implies improved lower bounds for group fair division.</description>

      <title>{\alpha}-RACER: Real-Time Algorithm for Game-Theoretic Motion Planning and Control in Autonomous Racing using Near-Potential Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar at its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms can achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for single-car scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous racing is limited. To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling framework that incorporates the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like overtaking and blocking through a novel policy parametrization, while operating the car at its limit. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic approach to compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy, which represents the optimal approach in the presence of competing agents. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework of dynamic near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash equilibrium. Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the offline phase, we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function that approximates utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the online computation of approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We evaluate our method in a head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to several existing baselines.</description>
