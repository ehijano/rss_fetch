      <title>Herman's converse KAM mechanism revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his celebrated counterexample to the KAM theorem, Herman introduced a perturbation of an integrable system consisting of two components: a hyperbolic term and a bump function. He also remarked that it was unclear whether the bump function was truly necessary. In this note, we prove that the bump function is indeed necessary when more natural hyperbolic perturbations are considered. The proof of this necessity relies on an improved Siegel--Brjuno estimate and a parameter-dependent renormalization of resonances within the direct KAM method.</description>

      <title>Effective SPR property for surface diffeomorphisms and three-dimensional vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that ergodic measures with large entropy give uniformly large measure to the set of points with simultaneously long unstable and long stable manifolds. As a consequence, for $C^{\infty}$ surface diffeomorphisms, we establish an effective version of the SPR property. For $C^{\infty}$ three-dimensional flows without singularities, we prove the finiteness of equilibrium measures for admissible potentials whose variation is strictly less than half of the topological entropy.</description>

Abstract: We show that the abelian Liv\v{s}ic theorem recently obtained by A. Gogolev and F.

      <title>Hopf bifurcations in a reaction-diffusion model with a general advection term and delay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of reaction-diffusion population models defined on a bounded domain, characterized by a general time-delayed per capita growth rate and a general advection term. Notably, the growth rate encompasses both Logistic-type and weak Allee effect-type dynamical behaviors. By applying the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence of spatially inhomogeneous steady states when a parameter approaches the principal eigenvalue of a non-self-adjoint elliptic operator. A detailed analysis of the characteristic equation further confirms the existence of Hopf bifurcations originating from these steady states. Subsequently, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we ascertain the direction of these Hopf bifurcations and the stability of the resulting periodic orbits. Finally, the proposed general theoretical results are successfully applied to a "food-limited" population model and a weak Allee effect-driven population model, each of which incorporates diffusion, time delay, and advection, thus confirming the validity of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of Highly Inclined Near Halo Orbits using Moser Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation structure of highly inclined near halo orbits with close approaches to the light primary, in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Standard Map with Prescribed Actions and Lyapunov Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct nontrivial deformations of the standard map which preserve the symplectic actions, respectively the Lyapunov exponents, of infinitely many periodic orbits accumulating to an invariant curve. The proof uses a resonant normal-form construction to obtain a sequence of periodic orbits accumulating on an invariant curve with a Liouville rotation number. Within these normal forms we capture the dependence of these periodic orbits on the resonant Fourier coefficients of the dynamics on the invariant curve and, using the contraction mapping principle, obtain a suitable deformation achieving the prescribed spectral data associated with this sequence of orbits. The result can be viewed as a symplectic twist-map analogue of a length spectral nonrigidity phenomenon for Riemannian manifolds and convex billiards, and it motivates the existence problem for similar 'partially length-isospectral' deformations of strictly convex billiard tables.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Non-Commutative Algebraic Geometry: Inflation, Bifurcation, and the Dynamics of Collapse across Division Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dynamical non-commutative algebraic geometry (DNCAG) by analyzing the evolution and stability of polynomial root manifolds in real normed division algebras ($\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$). We establish a Generalized Inflation Theorem, demonstrating that for central polynomials, the root set forms a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $G$ is the automorphism group of the algebra ($SO(3)$ for $\mathbb{H}$, $G_2$ for $\mathbb{O}$). This mechanism generates continuous geometry from non-commutativity. We analyze the dynamics under central modulation (breathing modes), classifying topological bifurcations ($\Delta=0$). We then analyze the topological collapse induced by non-central perturbations, governed by symmetry reduction. We utilize the Localization Theorem (Gordon-Motzkin) to explain the alignment of roots with coefficient subalgebras. We formalize the dynamics of collapse using gradient flow on the potential landscape $\mathcal{V}(x) = \|P(x)\|^2$, characterizing it as a deformation retract and proving that the collapse timescale exhibits critical slowing down with quadratic scaling ($T_{\rm collapse} \propto \epsilon^{-2}$). Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic formalism, proving an Entropy Scaling Law that rigorously characterizes the collapse as a symmetry-breaking phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semigroup of invariant types through the lens of Ellis theory; primarily focusing on definably amenable NIP groups. In this context, we observe that the collection of strong right $f$-generic types forms the unique minimal left ideal and thus, the Ellis subgroups are isomorphic to $G/G^{00}$ via the canonical quotient map. As consequence of the Newelski-Pillay conjecture, the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of invariant types are abstractly isomorphic to the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of finitely satisfiable types in the definable amenable NIP setting. We are interested in the existence of natural isomorphisms from invariant Ellis subgroups to finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups and we determine when these isomorphisms can be witnessed by variants of the canonical NIP retraction map. Several limiting examples are provided. Outside of the NIP context, we provide an abelian group (and thus definably amenable) with an $\emptyset$-definable (dfg) type in which the invariant Ellis subgroups and finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Consistent Projection of Langevin Dynamics: Preserving Thermodynamics and Kinetics in Coarse-Grained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse graining (CG) is an important task for efficient modeling and simulation of complex multi-scale systems, such as the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model.</description>

      <title>Exact and Parametric Dynamical System Representation of Nonlinear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric representations of various functions are fundamental tools in science and engineering. This paper introduces a fixed-initial-state constant-input dynamical system (FISCIDS) representation, which provides an exact and parametric model for a broad class of nonlinear functions. A FISCIDS representation of a given nonlinear function consists of an input-affine dynamical system with a fixed initial state and constant input. The argument of the function is applied as the constant input to the input-affine system, and the value of the function is the output of the input-affine system at a fixed terminal time. We show that any differentially algebraic function has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. We also show that there exists an analytic function that is not differentially algebraic but has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. Therefore, most functions in practical problems in science and engineering can be represented by a quadratic FISCIDS representation.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups. This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group. Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

Abstract: In this work we intend to study homoclinic classes for some classes of flows. To this end we obtain analogous results those obtained by Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures in the flow setting. Namely we prove that if the Lesbegue measure gives positive measure to both stable and unstable homoclinic classes of a periodic hyperbolic orbit, then their intersection constitute an ergodic component. Futhermore, with similar techiniques we state several results concerning regular SRB measures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper I study properties of the generators $\triangle_\gamma$ of non-local Dirichlet forms $\mathcal{E}^\mu_\gamma$ on ultrametric spaces which are the path space of simple stationary Bratteli diagrams. The measures used to define the Dirichlet forms are taken to be the Gibbs measures $\mu_\psi$ associated to H\"older continuous potentials $\psi$ for one-sided shifts. I also define a cohomology $H_{lc}(X_B)$ for $X_B$ which can be seen as dual to the homology of Bowen and Franks. Besides studying spectral properties of $\triangle_\gamma$, I show that for $\gamma$ large enough (with sharp bounds depending on the diagram and the measure theoretic entropy $h_{\mu_\psi}$ of $\mu_\psi$) there is a unique harmonic representative of any class $c\in H_{lc}(X_B)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.</description>
