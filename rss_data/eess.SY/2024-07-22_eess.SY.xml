      <title>Autonomous Nonlinear Passive Transmit-Receive Switch for Compact IoT Devices: A Three-Port Agile Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in RF technologies, especially Internet of Things (IoT) devices, require compact and integrated RF circulators or transmit-receive (TR) switches for efficient resource use. Although conventional techniques are crucial in managing signal flow to prevent signal interference to sensitive receiver components, they have some drawbacks, such as limited isolation, low switching speed, complex circuitry, bulkiness, and high cost. This work presents a smart, miniaturized, nonlinear TR switch capable of operating over a wide frequency range (0.8 - 1.3 GHz), making it suitable for IoT frequency bands. The switch achieves high isolation, low insertion loss, and intelligent transitions between transmitter and receiver without requiring external control or bias pins.</description>

      <title>Multidirectional Pixelated Cubic Antenna with Enhanced Isolation for Vehicular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pixelated cubic antenna design with enhanced isolation and diverse radiation pattern for vehicular applications. The design consists of four radiating patches to take advantage of a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern with enhanced isolation and high gain. The antenna system with four patches has been pixelated and optimized simultaneously to achieve desired performance and high isolation at 5.4 GHz band. The antenna achieved measured isolation of more than -34 dB between antenna elements. The overall isolation improvement obtained by the antenna is about 18 dB compared to a configuration using standard patch antennas. Moreover, isolation improvement is achieved through patch pixelization without additional resonators or elements. The antenna achieved up to 6.9 dB realized gain in each direction. Additionally, the cubic antenna system is equipped with an E-shaped GPS antenna to facilitate connectivity with GPS satellite. Finally, the antenna performance has been investigated using a simulation model of the vehicle roof and roof rack. The reflection coefficient, isolation and radiation patterns of the antenna remains unaffected. The antenna prototype has been fabricated on Rogers substrate and measured to verify the simulation results. The measured results correlate well with the simulation results. The proposed antenna features low-profile, simple design for ease of manufacture, good radiation characteristics with multidirectional property and high isolation, which are well-suited to vehicular applications in different environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Design of a Pixelated Rectenna for WPT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient rectenna (rectifying antenna) using a binary optimization algorithm. A novel pixelated receiving antenna has been developed to match the diode impedance of a rectifier, eliminating the need for a separate matching circuit in the rectenna's rectifier. The receiving antenna configuration is fine-tuned via a binary optimization algorithm. A rectenna is designed using optimization algorithm at 2.5 GHz with 38% RF-DC conversion efficiency when subjected to 0 dBm incident power, with an output voltage of 815mV. The proposed rectenna demonstrates versatility across various low-power WPT (wireless power transfer) applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Re-service in Reinforcement Learning Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach to traffic signal control that combines phase re-service with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL agent directly determines the duration of the next phase in a pre-defined sequence. Before the RL agent's decision is executed, we use the shock wave theory to estimate queue expansion at the designated movement allowed for re-service and decide if phase re-service is necessary. If necessary, a temporary phase re-service is inserted before the next regular phase. We formulate the RL problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO). We conducted a series of experiments that showed significant improvements thanks to the introduction of phase re-service. Vehicle delays are reduced by up to 29.95% of the average and up to 59.21% of the standard deviation. The number of stops is reduced by 26.05% on average with 45.77% less standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Inferring Ingrained Remote Information in AC Power Flows Using Neuromorphic Modality Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we infer ingrained remote information in AC power flows using spiking neural network (SNN) as edge processors for efficient coordination of power electronic converters. This work unifies power and information as a means of data normalization using a multi-modal regime in the form of spikes using energy-efficient neuromorphic processing and semantics theory. Firstly, we organize the synchronous realvalued measurements at each edge and translate them into asynchronous spike-based events to collect sparse data for training of SNN at each edge. Instead of relying on error-dependent supervised data-driven learning theory, we exploit the latency-driven unsupervised Hebbian learning rule to obtain modulation pulses for switching of power electronic converters that can now communicate among each other. Not only does this philosophy block exogenous path arrival for cyber attackers by dismissing the cyber layer, it also entails converter adaptation to system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues. We conclude this work by validating its energy-efficient and effective online learning performance under various scenarios in modified IEEE 14-bus system and under experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Optimization Framework for Energy Efficient UAV-assisted Fog Computing: Attitude Control, Trajectory Planning and Task Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Data-Driven Frequency Stability Constraint via Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding frequency stability constraints in the operation problem is challenging due to its complex dynamics. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to learn the stability criteria offline with the trained model embedded as a constraint of online optimization. However, random sampling of stationary operation points is less efficient in generating balanced stable and unstable samples. Meanwhile, the performance of such a model is strongly dependent on the quality of the training dataset. Observing this research gap, we propose a gradient-based data generation method via forward-mode automatic differentiation. In this method, the original dynamic system is augmented with new states that represent the dynamic of sensitivities of the original states, which can be solved by invoking any ODE solver for a single time. To compensate for the contradiction between the gradient of various frequency stability criteria, gradient surgery is proposed by projecting the gradient on the normal plane of the other. In the end, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed sampling algorithm, compared with the unrolling differentiation and finite difference. All codes are available at https://github.com/xuwkk/frequency_sample_ad.</description>

      <title>The statistical spread of transmission outages on a fast protection time scale based on utility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When there is a fault, the protection system automatically removes one or more transmission lines on a fast time scale of less than one minute. The outaged lines form a pattern in the transmission network. We extract these patterns from utility outage data, determine some key statistics of these patterns, and then show how to generate new patterns consistent with these statistics. The generated patterns provide a new and easily feasible way to model the overall effect of the protection system at the scale of a large transmission system. This new generative modeling of protection is expected to contribute to simulations of disturbances in large grids so that they can better quantify the risk of blackouts. Analysis of the pattern sizes suggests an index that describes how much outages spread in the transmission network at the fast timescale.</description>

      <title>UAV Active Perception and Motion Control for Improving Navigation Using Low-Cost Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study a model pipeline is proposed that combines computer vision with control-theoretic methods and utilizes low cost sensors. The proposed work enables perception-aware motion control for a quadrotor UAV to detect and navigate to objects of interest such as wind turbines and electric towers. The distance to the object of interest was estimated utilizing RGB as the primary sensory input. For the needs of the study, the Microsoft AirSim simulator was used. As a first step, a YOLOv8 model was integrated providing the basic position setpoints towards the detection. From the YOLOv8 inference, a target yaw angle was derived. The subsequent algorithms, combining performant in computational terms computer vision methods and YOLOv8, actively drove the drone to measure the height of the detection. Based on the height, an estimate of the depth was retrieved. In addition to this step, a convolutional neural network was developed, namely ActvePerceptionNet aiming at active YOLOv8 inference. The latter was validated for wind turbines where the rotational motion of the propeller was found to affect object confidence in a near periodical fashion. The results of the simulation experiments conducted in this study showed efficient object height and distance estimation and effective localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shifted frequency-based electromagnetic transient (SFEMT) simulation has greatly improved the computational efficiency of traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation for the ac grid. This letter proposes a novel interface for the co-simulation of the SFEMT model and the traditional EMT model. The general form of SFEMT modeling and the principle of analytical signal construction are first derived. Then, an interface for the co-simulation of EMT and SFEMT simulation is proposed based on rotational invariance techniques. Theoretical analyses and test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Safety Function Response Time on a Private 5G and IO-Link Wireless Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, there has been a growing significance of interactions between human workers and automated systems throughout the factory floor. Wherever static or mobile robots, such as automated guided vehicles, operate autonomously, a protected environment for personnel and machines must be provided by, e.g., safe, deterministic and low-latency technologies. Another trend in this area is the increased use of wireless communication, offering a high flexibility, modularity, and reduced installation and maintenance efforts. This work presents a testbed implementation that integrates a wireless framework, employing IO-Link Wireless (IOLW) and a private 5G cellular network, to orchestrate a complete example process from sensors and actuators up into the edge, represented by a programmable logic controller (PLC). Latency assessments identify the systems cycle time as well as opportunities for improvement. A worst-case estimation shows the attainable safety function response time for practical applications in the context of functional safety.</description>

      <title>More-than-Moore Microacoustics: A Scalable Fabrication Process for Suspended Lamb Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Photolithography is currently used to fabricate mass-scale integrated circuits (ICs). Its high throughput and resolution could benefit large-scale RF MEMS production for the telecommunication market. We present a process flow to fabricate suspended acoustic resonators using DUV Photolithography. This method allows for scalable production of resonators with critical dimensions of 250 nm and alignment accuracy of less than 100 nm. We show how photoresists and anti-reflective coatings integrate with the process, help with deposition quality and resolution, and how Ion Beam Etching allows for vertical sidewalls of the resonators. We measure resonance frequencies (fr) up to 7.5 GHz and electromechanical couplings up to 8%, and we investigate the uniformity of this process by analyzing the deviation of fs over the wafer surface for four main resonance modes. We show that the deviation of the S0 mode can be kept below 1%. These results indicate the suitability of this process for quick scale-up of Lamb wave resonator technology, bridging the gap from research to industry.</description>

      <title>Should we use model-free or model-based control? A case study of battery management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) each offer distinct advantages and limitations when applied to control problems in power and energy systems. Despite various studies on these methods, benchmarks remain lacking and the preference for RL over traditional controls is not well understood. In this work, we put forth a comparative analysis using RL- and MPC-based controllers for optimizing a battery management system (BMS). The BMS problem aims to minimize costs while adhering to operational limits. by adjusting the battery (dis)charging in response to fluctuating electricity prices over a time horizon. The MPC controller uses a learningbased forecast of future demand and price changes to formulate a multi-period linear program, that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Meanwhile, the RL controller requires no timeseries modeling but instead is trained from the sample trajectories using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Numerical tests compare these controllers across optimality, training time, testing time, and robustness, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their efficacy. RL not only yields optimal solutions quickly but also ensures robustness to shifts in customer behavior, such as changes in demand distribution. However, as expected, training the RL agent is more time-consuming than MPC.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Salvo Guidance over Leader-Follower Network with Free-Will Arbitrary Time Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cooperative salvo strategy is proposed in this paper which achieves consensus among the interceptors within a pre-defined arbitrary settling time. Considering non-linear engagement kinematics and a system lag to capture the effect of interceptor autopilot as present in realistic interception scenarios, the guidance schemes use the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors in order to achieve simultaneous interception of a stationary target at a pre-determined impact time. The guidance scheme ensures that consensus among the time-to-go estimates of the interceptors is achieved within a settling time whose upper bound can be pre-specified arbitrarily independent of the initial conditions or design parameters. The efficacy of the proposed guidance strategy is demonstrated using numerical simulations with varied conditions of initial position, velocities and heading angle errors of the interceptors as well as different desired impact times.</description>

      <title>A Methodology for Power Dispatch Based on Traction Station Clusters in the Flexible Traction Power Supply System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flexible traction power supply system (FTPSS) eliminates the neutral zone but leads to increased complexity in power flow coordinated control and power mismatch. To address these challenges, the methodology for power dispatch (PD) based on traction station clusters (TSCs) in FTPSS is proposed, in which each TSC with a consistent structure performs independent local phase angle control. First, to simplify the PD problem of TSCs, the system is transformed into an equivalent model with constant topology, resulting in it can be solved by univariate numerical optimization with higher computational performance. Next, the calculation method of the feasible phase angle domain under strict and relaxed power circulation constraints are described, respectively, which ensures that power circulation can be either eliminated or precisely controlled. Finally, the PD method with three unique modes for uncertain train loads is introduced to enhance power flow flexibility: specified power distribution coefficients between traction substations (TSs), constant output power of TSs, and maximum consumption of renewable resources within TSs. In the experimental section, the performance of the TSC methodology for PD is verified through detailed train operation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-to-Everything: Looking into the Future of Flexibility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of this paper is to illuminate potential Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) flexibility services that can be activated at the three levels of home, community, and grid. To do this, the potential practical services that can be provided by EVs, flexibility requesters, and the required exchange mechanisms at these three levels are identified. At the home level, the two main services that EVs can provide to households are explored. The initial service focuses on cost reduction for homes by employing smart charging and discharging methods, and the second service underscores the capability of an EV equipped with bidirectional chargers to function as a backup resource during grid outages. At the community level, three flexibility services are introduced and outlined: community cost reduction, energy sharing, and backup resources. There is more than one flexibility requester, including the community manager, EV owners, and other end users. Accordingly, at this level, having a fair and transparent market mechanism can optimise the activation of different V2X flexibility services. At the grid level, flexibility providers can offer two main flexibility services, namely load profile adjustment and real-time voltage and frequency control, to a wide range of flexibility requesters, including distribution network/systems operators (DNOs/DSOs) to overcome technical challenges of the distribution network, energy suppliers to manage their energy portfolio, and TSOs to support transmission network. In addition, a review of trial V2X projects and V2X supporting regulations is presented to contextualize the feasibility and regulatory framework for implementing these services. This analysis offers insights into the challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed for the effective integration of V2X flexibility services across the three identified levels.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Based Resource Allocation Strategy in Ultra-Reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are vastly used in generative AI, leveraging their capability to capture complex data distributions. However, their potential remains largely unexplored in the field of resource allocation in wireless networks. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based resource allocation strategy for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) with the objective of minimizing total power consumption through the optimization of the sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error probability in the finite blocklength regime of the communication system. The problem is first reduced to the optimization of blocklength only based on the derivation of the optimality conditions. Then, the optimization theory solution collects a dataset of channel gains and corresponding optimal blocklengths. Finally, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) uses this collected dataset to train the resource allocation algorithm that generates optimal blocklength values conditioned on the channel state information (CSI). Via extensive simulations, the proposed approach is shown to outperform previously proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches with close to optimal performance regarding total power consumption. Moreover, an improvement of up to eighteen-fold in the reduction of critical constraint violations is observed, further underscoring the accuracy of the solution.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Energy Harvesters: State-of-the-Art Designs and Their Potential for Energy Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface Energy Harvesters (MEHs) have emerged as a prominent enabler of highly efficient Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesters. This survey delves into the fundamentals of the MEH technology, providing a comprehensive overview of their working principle, unit cell designs and prototypes over various frequency bands, as well as state-of-the art modes of operation. Inspired by the recent academic and industrial interest on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs)for the upcoming sixth-Generation (6G) of wireless networks, we study the interplay between this technology and MEHs aiming for energy sustainable RISs power by metasurface-based RF energy harvesting. We present a novel hybrid unit cell design capable of simultaneous energy harvesting and 1-bit tunable reflection whose dual-functional response is validated via full-wave simulations. Then, we conduct a comparative collection of real-world measurements for ambient RF power levels and power consumption budgets of reflective RISs to unveil the potential for a self-sustainable RIS via ambient RF energy harvesting. The paper is concluded with an elaborative discussion on open design challenges and future research directions for MEHs and energy sustainable hybrid RISs.</description>

      <title>QoS Aware Mixed-Criticality Task Scheduling in Vehicular Edge Cloud System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern-day cars are equipped with numerous cameras and sensors, typically integrated with advanced decision-control systems that enable the vehicle to perceive its surroundings and navigate autonomously. Efficient processing of data from sensors, lidars, radars and cameras is quite computationally intensive and can not be done with good accuracy using less capable onboard resources. In order to deal with this problem, some computation requirements (also referred as tasks) are offloaded to infrastructure or executed in parallel in both autonomous vehicle (AV) and infrastructure to enhance accuracy. The infrastructure comprises base stations, a centralized cloud, and a CS. Base stations (BSs) execute tasks in collaboration with a significantly more powerful centralized cloud, while the centralised scheduler (CS) centrally schedules all the tasks. The base station receives tasks from multiple AVs, each with varying deadlines, criticality, and locations. Our main goal is to maximize the profit of the infrastructure by (a) minimizing the number of drop tasks, (b) minimizing the distance cost for task offloading, and (c) minimizing the energy usage of BSs.
  In this work, we proposed efficient approaches to schedule the collection of tasks to the BSs, by employing a hybrid scheduling approach where tasks from AVs get allocated to nearby base stations if the nearby BSs are lightly loaded, otherwise AVs send the task to CS for allocation. The CS maximizes the profit by following strategies: (a) selection of BS considering distance and energy consumption, (b) when task load is moderate or low, highly critical tasks run at favourable utilisation, and (c) low-critical tasks are dropped to free up resources for executing high-critical tasks. Based on our experiments, proposed approaches improved the QoS provided by up to 25% compared to the state-of-the-art approach in real-life datasets.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally Robust Optimization Framework for Stochastic Assessment of Power System Flexibility in Economic Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the complexity of power systems, particularly the high-dimensional variability of net loads, accurately depicting the entire operational range of net loads poses a challenge. To address this, recent methodologies have sought to gauge the maximum range of net load uncertainty across all buses. In this paper, we consider the stochastic nature of the net load and introduce a distributionally robust optimization framework that assesses system flexibility stochastically, accommodating a minimal extent of system violations. We verify the proposed method by solving the flexibility of the real-time economic dispatch problem on four IEEE standard test systems. Compared to traditional deterministic flexibility evaluations, our approach consistently yields less conservative flexibility outcomes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Microgrid Performance Prediction with Attention-based Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, an effort is made to address microgrid systems' operational challenges, characterized by power oscillations that eventually contribute to grid instability. An integrated strategy is proposed, leveraging the strengths of convolutional and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. This approach is aimed at effectively extracting temporal data from energy datasets to improve the precision of microgrid behavior forecasts. Additionally, an attention layer is employed to underscore significant features within the time-series data, optimizing the forecasting process. The framework is anchored by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is tasked with comprehensive load forecasting and the identification of abnormal grid behaviors. Our methodology underwent rigorous evaluation using the Micro-grid Tariff Assessment Tool dataset, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2-score) serving as the primary metrics. The approach demonstrated exemplary performance, evidenced by a MAE of 0.39, RMSE of 0.28, and an r2-score of 98.89\% in load forecasting, along with near-perfect zero state prediction accuracy (approximately 99.9\%). Significantly outperforming conventional machine learning models such as support vector regression and random forest regression, our model's streamlined architecture is particularly suitable for real-time applications, thereby facilitating more effective and reliable microgrid management.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that evolves into an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Optimizes Power Dispatch in Decentralized Power Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective frequency control in power grids has become increasingly important with the increasing demand for renewable energy sources. Here, we propose a novel strategy for resolving this challenge using graph convolutional proximal policy optimization (GC-PPO). The GC-PPO method can optimally determine how much power individual buses dispatch to reduce frequency fluctuations across a power grid. We demonstrate its efficacy in controlling disturbances by applying the GC-PPO to the power grid of the UK. The performance of GC-PPO is outstanding compared to the classical methods. This result highlights the promising role of GC-PPO in enhancing the stability and reliability of power systems by switching lines or decentralizing grid topology.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms for Virtual Reality Streaming over Wi-Fi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive Virtual Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi networks encounters significant challenges due to bandwidth fluctuations caused by channel contention and user mobility. Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically adjust the video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity, aiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR algorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR streaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that provide a robust characterization of the network's state, enabling more informed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance indicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the newly implemented network performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's video bitrate adaptation capabilities.</description>

      <title>How to Shrink Confidence Sets for Many Equivalent Discrete Distributions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the situation when a learner faces a set of unknown discrete distributions $(p_k)_{k\in \mathcal K}$ defined over a common alphabet $\mathcal X$, and can build for each distribution $p_k$ an individual high-probability confidence set thanks to $n_k$ observations sampled from $p_k$. The set $(p_k)_{k\in \mathcal K}$ is structured: each distribution $p_k$ is obtained from the same common, but unknown, distribution q via applying an unknown permutation to $\mathcal X$. We call this \emph{permutation-equivalence}. The goal is to build refined confidence sets \emph{exploiting} this structural property. Like other popular notions of structure (Lipschitz smoothness, Linearity, etc.) permutation-equivalence naturally appears in machine learning problems, and to benefit from its potential gain calls for a specific approach. We present a strategy to effectively exploit permutation-equivalence, and provide a finite-time high-probability bound on the size of the refined confidence sets output by the strategy. Since a refinement is not possible for too few observations in general, under mild technical assumptions, our finite-time analysis establish when the number of observations $(n_k)_{k\in \mathcal K}$ are large enough so that the output confidence sets improve over initial individual sets. We carefully characterize this event and the corresponding improvement. Further, our result implies that the size of confidence sets shrink at asymptotic rates of $O(1/\sqrt{\sum_{k\in \mathcal K} n_k})$ and $O(1/\max_{k\in K} n_{k})$, respectively for elements inside and outside the support of q, when the size of each individual confidence set shrinks at respective rates of $O(1/\sqrt{n_k})$ and $O(1/n_k)$. We illustrate the practical benefit of exploiting permutation equivalence on a reinforcement learning task.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization and Ambiguity-based Learning of Distributionally Uncertain Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to construct data-driven online solutions to optimization problems (P) subject to a class of distributionally uncertain dynamical systems. The introduced framework allows for the simultaneous learning of distributional system uncertainty via a parameterized, control-dependent ambiguity set using a finite historical data set, and its use to make online decisions with probabilistic regret function bounds. Leveraging the merits of Machine Learning, the main technical approach relies on the theory of Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), to hedge against uncertainty and provide less conservative results than standard Robust Optimization approaches. Starting from recent results that describe ambiguity sets via parameterized, and control-dependent empirical distributions as well as ambiguity radii, we first present a tractable reformulation of the corresponding optimization problem while maintaining the probabilistic guarantees. We then specialize these problems to the cases of 1) optimal one-stage control of distributionally uncertain nonlinear systems, and 2) resource allocation under distributional uncertainty. A novelty of this work is that it extends DRO to online optimization problems subject to a distributionally uncertain dynamical system constraint, handled via a control-dependent ambiguity set that leads to online-tractable optimization with probabilistic guarantees on regret bounds. Further, we introduce an online version of Nesterov's accelerated-gradient algorithm, and analyze its performance to solve this class of problems via dissipativity theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel recursive utility for controlling stochastic processes under risk and uncertainty. Our formulation uses a robustified Orlicz risk that can evaluate risk and uncertainty simultaneously. We focus on a control problem of a photovoltaic power generation system that supplies excess electricity to a secondary purpose for generating green hydrogen. The corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation having a novel nonlinear term is then derived. Computational examples with the available data are finally presented, demonstrating that our methodology can be used for the photovoltaic power generation under different meteorological and operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast Risk Assessment in Power Grids through Novel Gaussian Process and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a graph-structured Gaussian process (GP) model for data-driven risk assessment of critical voltage constraints. The proposed GP is based on a novel kernel, named the vertex-degree kernel (VDK), that decomposes the voltage-load relationship based on the network graph. To estimate the GP efficiently, we propose a novel active learning scheme that leverages the additive structure of VDK. Further, we prove a probabilistic bound on the error in risk estimation using VDK-GP model that demonstrates that it is statistically comparable to using standard AC power flow (AC-PF), but does not require computing a large number of ACPF solutions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed VDK-GP achieves more than two fold sample complexity reduction, compared to a generic GP on medium scale 500-Bus and large scale 1354-Bus power systems. Moreover, active learning achieves an impressive reduction of over 15 times in comparison to the time complexity of Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS), and have risk estimation error of order 1E-4 for both 500-Bus and 1354-Bus system, demonstrating its superior efficiency in risk estimation.</description>

      <title>Scalable {\delta}-Level Coherent State Synchronization of Multi-Agent Systems in the Presence of Bounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study scalable {\delta}-Level coherent state synchronization for multi-agent systems (MAS) where the agents are subject to bounded disturbances/noises. We propose a scale-free framework designed solely based on the knowledge of agent models and agnostic to the communication graphs and size of the network. We define the level of coherency for each agent as the norm of the weighted sum of the disagreement dynamics with its neighbors. The objective is to restrict the level of coherency of the network to {\delta} without a-priori information about the disturbances.</description>

      <title>Priority-based Energy Allocation in Buildings through Distributed Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many countries are facing energy shortage today and most of the global energy is consumed by HVAC systems in buildings. For the scenarios where the energy system is not sufficiently supplied to HVAC systems, a priority-based allocation scheme based on distributed model predictive control is proposed in this paper, which distributes the energy rationally based on priority order. According to the scenarios, two distributed allocation strategies, i.e., one-to-one priority strategy and multi-to-one priority strategy, are developed in this paper and validated by simulation in a building containing three zones and a building containing 36 rooms, respectively. Both priority-based strategies fully exploit the potential of predictive control solutions. The experiment shows that our scheme has good scalability and achieve the performance of centralized strategy while making the calculation tractable.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Maximal Coverage and Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer, which is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), for maximum coverage while also ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. Our approach is distinguished by the use of nonholonomic constraints to model vehicles with accelerations serving as control inputs and coupled engagement kinematics to craft the pursuer's guidance law meticulously. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. To validate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithm, we conduct experimental tests by implementing a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios. The results obtained showcase the resilience of the proposed guidance law, effectively handling arbitrarily maneuvering targets, vehicle/autopilot dynamics, and external disturbances. Our method consistently delivers stable global enclosing behaviors, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers, and requires only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Personalized Energy Consumption Range Estimation for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In urban traffic environments, driver behaviors exhibit considerable diversity in vehicle operation, encompassing a range of acceleration and braking maneuvers as well as adherence to traffic regulations, such as speed limits. It is well-established that these intrinsic driving behaviors significantly influence vehicle energy consumption. Therefore, establishing a quantitative relationship between driver behavior and energy usage is essential for identifying energy-efficient driving practices and optimizing routes within urban traffic. This study introduces a data-driven approach to predict the equivalent fuel consumption of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) based on an integrated model of driver behavior and vehicle energy consumption. Unlike traditional models that provide point predictions of fuel consumption, this approach uses Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to offer prediction intervals that capture the variability and uncertainty in fuel consumption. These intervals reflect changes in fuel consumption, as well as variations in driver behavior, and vehicle and route conditions. To develop this model, driver-specific data were collected through a driver-in-the-loop simulator, which tested different human drivers responses. The CQR model was then trained and validated using the experimental data from the driver-in-the-loop simulator, augmented by the synthetic data generated from Monte Carlo simulations conducted using a calibrated microscopic driver behavior and vehicle energy model. The CQR model was evaluated by comparing its predictions of equivalent fuel consumption intervals with those of baseline prediction interval methods that rely solely on conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantifying distribution system resilience from utility data: large event risk and benefits of investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on large blackouts in electric distribution systems caused by extreme winds. Such events have a large cost and impact on customers. To quantify resilience to these events, we formulate large event risk and show how to calculate it from the historical outage data routinely collected by utilities' outage management systems. Risk is defined using an event cost exceedance curve. The tail of this curve and the large event risk is described by the probability of a large cost event and the slope magnitude of the tail on a log-log plot. Resilience can be improved by planned investments to upgrade system components or speed up restoration. The benefits that these investments would have had if they had been made in the past can be quantified by "rerunning history" with the effects of the investment included, and then recalculating the large event risk to find the improvement in resilience. An example using utility data shows a 12% and 22% reduction in the probability of a large cost event due to 10% wind hardening and 10% faster restoration respectively. This new data-driven approach to quantify resilience and resilience investments is realistic and much easier to apply than complicated approaches based on modeling all the phases of resilience. Moreover, an appeal to improvements to past lived experience may well be persuasive to customers and regulators in making the case for resilience investments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Data Fusion for Collaborative Attitude Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the collaborative attitude estimation problem for a multi-agent system. The agents are equipped with sensors that provide directional measurements and relative attitude measurements. We present a bottom-up approach where each agent runs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) locally using directional measurements and augments this with relative attitude measurements provided by neighbouring agents. The covariance estimates of the relative attitude measurements are geometrically corrected to compensate for relative attitude between the agent that makes the measurement and the agent that uses the measurement before being fused with the local estimate using the convex combination ellipsoid (CCE) method to avoid data incest. Simulations are undertaken to numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we first provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state and a simple constraint tightening. Both formulations ensure recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear systems using stochastic contraction metrics. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method through a simulation of a chain of mass-spring-dampers with nonlinear Coulomb friction. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control approaches with closed-loop guaranteed for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic representation learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias &amp; Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent scheme proposed independently in Collins et al., (2021) and Nayer and Vaswani (2022), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Socially Integrated Navigation: A Social Acting Robot with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots are being used on a large scale in various crowded situations and become part of our society. The socially acceptable navigation behavior of a mobile robot with individual human consideration is an essential requirement for scalable applications and human acceptance. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches are recently used to learn a robot's navigation policy and to model the complex interactions between robots and humans. We propose to divide existing DRL-based navigation approaches based on the robot's exhibited social behavior and distinguish between social collision avoidance with a lack of social behavior and socially aware approaches with explicit predefined social behavior. In addition, we propose a novel socially integrated navigation approach where the robot's social behavior is adaptive and emerges from the interaction with humans. The formulation of our approach is derived from a sociological definition, which states that social acting is oriented toward the acting of others. The DRL policy is trained in an environment where other agents interact socially integrated and reward the robot's behavior individually. The simulation results indicate that the proposed socially integrated navigation approach outperforms a socially aware approach in terms of ego navigation performance while significantly reducing the negative impact on all agents within the environment.</description>

      <title>Combination of Site-Wide and Real-Time Optimization for the Control of Systems of Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy sources has introduced significant volatility and unpredictability in the energy supply chain, necessitating advanced control strategies to ensure grid stability and reliability. Green hydrogen production via electrolysis offers a viable solution for converting and storing this volatile renewable energy. However, the inherent fluctuations of renewable energy sources present challenges for consistent utilization and integration of green hydrogen. This work proposes a two-stage optimization approach, combining site-wide optimization and real-time optimization for managing systems of electrolyzers. By adapting an existing static optimization model, dual use is achieved in both site-wide optimization and real-time optimization. The hierarchical optimization structure, characterized by distinct temporal resolutions, enables effective responses to both dynamic changes and long-term trends. The side-wide optimization layer generates long-term plans based on forecast data, while the real-time optimization layer refines these plans in real-time, accommodating immediate fluctuations and ensuring efficient operation. The results from the case study on a system of electrolyzers demonstrate the method's effectiveness in aligning electrolyzer operation with actual availability of renewable energy. This approach offers a robust framework for optimizing the operation of electrolyzers but also other types of flexible energy resources, contributing to sustainable and economically viable energy management.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Heterogeneous Platoons with Affine Spacing Policies and Arbitrary Communication Topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for a heterogeneous platoon using arbitrary communication topologies, provided each vehicle can communicate with a preceding vehicle in the platoon. The proposed DMPC algorithm can accommodate any spacing policy that is affine in a vehicle's velocity, which includes constant distance or constant time headway spacing policies. By analyzing the total cost for the entire platoon, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure platoon asymptotic stability. Simulation experiments with a platoon of 50 vehicles and hardware experiments with a platoon of four 1/10th-scale vehicles validate the algorithm and compare performance under different spacing policies and communication topologies.</description>

      <title>LLM experiments with simulation: Large Language Model Multi-Agent System for Simulation Model Parametrization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of a multi-agent system framework that applies large language models (LLMs) to automate the parametrization of simulation models in digital twins. This framework features specialized LLM agents tasked with observing, reasoning, decision-making, and summarizing, enabling them to dynamically interact with digital twin simulations to explore parametrization possibilities and determine feasible parameter settings to achieve an objective. The proposed approach enhances the usability of simulation model by infusing it with knowledge heuristics from LLM and enables autonomous search for feasible parametrization to solve a user task. Furthermore, the system has the potential to increase user-friendliness and reduce the cognitive load on human users by assisting in complex decision-making processes. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated through a case study, and the visualized demos and codes are available at a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLMDrivenSimulation</description>

      <title>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Auditory Filterbanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Auditory Filters/Filterbanks (GAFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-order GAFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters. In the case of GAFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</description>
