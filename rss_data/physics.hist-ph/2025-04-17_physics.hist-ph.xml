      <title>Reflective Empiricism: Bias Reflection and Introspection as a Scientific Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Reflective Empiricism, an extension of empirical science that incorporates subjective perception and consciousness processes as equally valid sources of knowledge. It views reality as an interplay of subjective experience and objective laws, comprehensible only through systematic introspection, bias reflection, and premise-based logical-explorative modeling. This approach overcomes paradigmatic blindness arising from unreflected subjective filters in established paradigms, promoting an adaptable science. Innovations include a method for bias recognition, premise-based models grounded in observed phenomena to unlock new conceptual spaces, and Heureka moments - intuitive insights - as starting points for hypotheses, subsequently tested empirically. The author's self-observation, such as analyzing belief formation, demonstrates its application and transformative power. Rooted in philosophical and scientific-historical references (e.g., Archimedes' intuition, quantum observer effect), Reflective Empiricism connects physics, psychology, and philosophy, enhancing interdisciplinary synthesis and accelerating knowledge creation by leveraging anomalies and subjective depth. It does not seek to replace empirical research but to enrich it, enabling a more holistic understanding of complex phenomena like consciousness and advancing 21st-century science.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Refutation of the New Chronology by Fomenko and Nosovsky: The 1151-Year Planetary Cycle and Dating of the Almagest via Speed/Error Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two astronomical methods developed through computational simulation to evaluate the historical dating of ancient astronomical sources. The first identifies a 1151-year planetary cycle based on the recurrence of visible configurations of Mercury to Saturn, including the Sun and Moon, from a geocentric perspective. The second, called SESCC (Speed-Error Signals Cross Correlation), statistically estimates the epoch of star catalogs by analyzing the correlation between positional error and proper motion in ecliptic latitude. Both methods are reproducible, data-driven, and yield results that contradict key tenets of the New Chronology proposed by Fomenko and Nosovsky, most notably the claim that the Anno Domini began in 1152 CE. Open-source code and analysis tools are provided for independent verification.</description>
