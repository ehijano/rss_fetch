      <title>Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>

      <title>Predictive Indicator of Critical Point in Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Magnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining critical points of phase transitions from partial data is essential to avoid abrupt system collapses and reducing experimental or computational costs. However, the complex physical systems and phase transition phenomena have long hindered the development of unified approaches applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this work, we propose predictive indicators to determine critical points in equilibrium and nonequilibrium magnetic systems based on frequency-dependent response function. For equilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching under magnetic field, the static magnetization response function to a perturbing magnetic field diverges at the critical field, serving as a noise-resilient predictive indicator that also reflects the transition order and critical exponents. In contrast, for nonequilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque, static response fails to signal criticality. Instead, the dynamic response at ferromagnetic resonance frequency diverges at the critical point, which is also robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate that these static and dynamic indicators can be unified in the frame of first-order linear differential systems, offering a generalizable strategy for predicting criticality in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Gravitational Frame-Dragging with a Superfluid $^4$He Gyrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate. Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK, which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4 Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>
