      <title>Finite-Horizon Discrete-Time Optimal Control for Nonlinear Systems under State and Control Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal control problem of finite-horizon discrete-time nonlinear systems under state and control constraints. A novel numerical algorithm based on optimal control theory is proposed to achieve superior computational efficiency, with the novelty lying in establishing a unified framework that integrates all aspects of algorithm design through the solution of forward and backward difference equations (FBDEs). Firstly, the state and control constraints are transformed using an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), thereby decomposing the original optimal control problem into several optimization subproblems. These subproblems are then reformulated as new optimal control problem, which are solved through the corresponding FBDEs, resulting in an algorithm with superlinear convergence rate. Furthermore, the gradient and Hessian matrix are computed by iteratively solving FBDEs, thereby accelerating the optimization process. The gradient is obtained through the standard Hamiltonian, while the Hessian matrix is derived by constructing a novel Hamiltonian specifically designed for second-order optimization, transforming each row into an iterative solution of a new set of FBDEs. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through simulation results in automatic guided vehicles (AGV) trajectory tracking control.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Partially Observed Mean Field Stackelberg Stochastic Differential Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a linear-quadratic partially observed mean field Stackelberg stochastic differential game, which contains a leader and a large number of followers. Specifically, the followers confront a large-population Nash game subsequent to the leader's initial announcement of his strategy. In turn, the leader optimizes his own cost functional, taking into account the anticipated reactions of the followers. The state equations of both the leader and the followers are general stochastic differential equations, where the drift terms contain both the state average term and the state expectation term. However, the followers' average state terms enter into the drift term of the leader's state equation and the state expectation term of the leader enters into the state equation of the follower, reflecting the mutual influence between the leader and the followers. By utilizing the techniques of state decomposition and backward separation principle, we deduce the open-loop adapted decentralized strategies and feedback decentralized strategies of this leader-followers system, and demonstrate that the decentralized strategies are the corresponding $\varepsilon$-Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Descent for Non-smooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-smooth optimization models play a fundamental role in various disciplines, including engineering, science, management, and finance. However, classical algorithms for solving such models often struggle with convergence speed, scalability, and parameter tuning, particularly in high-dimensional and non-convex settings. In this paper, we explore how quantum mechanics can be leveraged to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we investigate the theoretical properties of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) algorithm for non-smooth optimization in both continuous and discrete time. First, we propose continuous-time variants of the general QHD algorithm and establish their global convergence and convergence rate for non-smooth convex and strongly convex problems through a novel Lyapunov function design. Furthermore, we prove the finite-time global convergence of continuous-time QHD for non-smooth non-convex problems under mild conditions (i.e., locally Lipschitz). In addition, we propose discrete-time QHD, a fully digitized implementation of QHD via operator splitting (i.e., product formula). We find that discrete-time QHD exhibits similar convergence properties even with large time steps. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the computational advantages of QHD over classical non-smooth non-convex optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Vaccination Strategies for an Heterogeneous SIS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in a general mathematical framework the optimal allocation of vaccine in an heterogeneous population. We cast the problem of optimal vaccination as a bi-objective minimization problem min(C($\eta$),L($\eta$)), where C and L stand respectively for the cost and the loss incurred when following the vaccination strategy $\eta$, where the function $\eta$(x) represents the proportion of non-vaccinated among individuals of feature x.To measure the loss, we consider either the effective reproduction number, a classical quantity appearing in many models in epidemiology, or the overall proportion of infected individuals after vaccination in the maximal equilibrium, also called the endemic state. We only make few assumptions on the cost C($\eta$), which cover in particular the uniform cost, that is, the total number of vaccinated people.The analysis of the bi-objective problem is carried in a general framework, and we check that it is well posed for the SIS model and has Pareto optima, which can be interpreted as the ``best'' vaccination strategies. We provide properties of the corresponding Pareto frontier given by the outcomes (C($\eta$), L($\eta$)) of Pareto optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>

      <title>How much should we care about what others know? Jump signals in optimal investment under relative performance concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent and mean-field formulation of a game between investors who receive private signals informing their investment decisions and who interact through relative performance concerns. A key tool in our model is a Poisson random measure which drives jumps in both market prices and signal processes and thus captures common and idiosyncratic noise. Upon receiving a jump signal, an investor evaluates not only the signal's implications for stock price movements but also its implications for the signals received by her peers and for their subsequent investment decisions. A crucial aspect of this assessment is the distribution of investor types in the economy. These types determine their risk aversion, performance concerns, and the quality and quantity of their signals. We demonstrate how these factors are reflected in the corresponding HJB equations, characterizing an agent's optimal response to her peers' signal-based strategies. The existence of equilibria in both the multi-agent and mean-field game is established using Schauder's Fixed Point Theorem under suitable conditions on investor characteristics, particularly their signal processes. Finally, we present numerical case studies that illustrate these equilibria from a financial-economic perspective. This allows us to address questions such as how much investors should care about the information known by their peers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Service Differentiation and Energy Management in Hybrid WiFi/LiFi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an innovative predict-and-optimize algorithm designed for hybrid WiFi/LiFi networks, aiming to achieve service differentiation while maximizing energy efficiency (EE). The proposed framework utilizes multi-access technology real-time intelligent controller (mATRIC) to dynamically predict the appropriate network slice for each user based on historically monitored key performance indicators (KPIs). This prediction is facilitated by a deep learning model trained using the resilient backpropagation algorithm, with training conducted on KPIs data at the universal non-real time RAN intelligent controller (non-RT RIC). This trained model enables real-time slice selection by mATRIC. In the subsequent phase, the algorithm focuses on optimizing EE of hybrid network as a function of precoding vectors for the predicted slices by employing techniques from sequential convex approximation and the inner approximation method. We introduce novel approximations to convert non-convex objective functions and constraints into convex forms, and develop an iterative algorithm to achieve sub-optimal solutions. Additionally, the EE maximization problem, ensures alignment with end-to-end latency requirements. It also addresses the various constraints inherent to hybrid systems, such as input signal limitations for LiFi LEDs, data rate restrictions, and power budget considerations. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating significant improvements in EE while ensuring service differentiation within hybrid network environments.</description>

      <title>Control Lyapunov Function Design via Configuration-Constrained Polyhedral Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes novel approaches for designing control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for constrained linear systems. We leverage recent configuration-constrained polyhedral computing techniques to devise piecewise affine convex CLFs. Additionally, we generalize these methods to uncertain systems with both additive and multiplicative disturbances. The proposed design methods are capable of approximating the infinite horizon cost function of both nominal and min-max optimal control problems by solving a single, one-stage, convex optimization problem. As such, these methods find practical applications in explicit controller design as well as in determining terminal regions and cost functions for nominal and min-max model predictive control (MPC). Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning over Arbitrary Topology: Linear Speed-Up with Polynomial Transient Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which $n$ agents, each with potentially heterogeneous local data, collaboratively minimize the sum of their local cost functions via peer-to-peer communication. We propose a novel algorithm, Spanning Tree Push-Pull (STPP), which employs two spanning trees extracted from a general communication graph to distribute both model parameters and stochastic gradients. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on spectral gap properties, STPP leverages a more flexible topological characterization, enabling robust information flow and efficient updates. Theoretically, we prove that STPP achieves linear speedup and polynomial transient iteration complexity, up to $O(n^7)$ for smooth nonconvex objectives and $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ for smooth strongly convex objectives, under arbitrary network topologies. Moreover, compared with the existing methods, STPP achieves faster convergence rates on sparse and non-regular topologies (e.g., directed ring) and reduces communication overhead on dense networks (e.g., static exponential graph). These results significantly advance the state of the art, especially when $n$ is large. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the strong performance of STPP and confirm the practical relevance of its theoretical convergence rates across various common graph architectures. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpanningTreePushPull-5D3E.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns a Mean Field Game (MFG) system related to a Nash type equilibrium for dynamical games associated to large populations. One shows that the MFG system may be viewed as the Euler-Lagrange system for an optimal control problem related to a Fokker-Planck equation with control in the drift. One derives the existence of a weak solution to the MFG system and under more restrictive assumptions one proves a uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Near-Linear Runtime for a Classical Matrix Preconditioning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, Osborne proposed a simple iterative algorithm for matrix balancing with outstanding numerical performance. Today, it is the default preconditioning procedure before eigenvalue computation and other linear algebra subroutines in mainstream software packages such as Python, Julia, MATLAB, EISPACK, LAPACK, and more. Despite its widespread usage, Osborne's algorithm has long resisted theoretical guarantees for its runtime: the first polynomial-time guarantees were obtained only in the past decade, and recent near-linear runtimes remain confined to variants of Osborne's algorithm with important differences that make them simpler to analyze but empirically slower. In this paper, we address this longstanding gap between theory and practice by proving that Osborne's original algorithm -- the de facto preconditioner in practice -- in fact has a near-linear runtime. This runtime guarantee (1) is optimal in the input size up to at most a single logarithm, (2) is the first runtime for Osborne's algorithm that does not dominate the runtime of downstream tasks like eigenvalue computation, and (3) improves upon the theoretical runtimes for all other variants of Osborne's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Complexity in Byzantine-Robust Distributed Stochastic Optimization with Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish tight lower bounds for Byzantine-robust distributed first-order stochastic optimization methods in both strongly convex and non-convex stochastic optimization. We reveal that when the distributed nodes have heterogeneous data, the convergence error comprises two components: a non-vanishing Byzantine error and a vanishing optimization error. We establish the lower bounds on the Byzantine error and on the minimum number of queries to a stochastic gradient oracle required to achieve an arbitrarily small optimization error. Nevertheless, we identify significant discrepancies between our established lower bounds and the existing upper bounds. To fill this gap, we leverage the techniques of Nesterov's acceleration and variance reduction to develop novel Byzantine-robust distributed stochastic optimization methods that provably match these lower bounds, up to logarithmic factors, implying that our established lower bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>The global convergence time of stochastic gradient descent in non-convex landscapes: Sharp estimates via large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the time it takes for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to reach the global minimum of a general, non-convex loss function. We approach this question through the lens of randomly perturbed dynamical systems and large deviations theory, and we provide a tight characterization of the global convergence time of SGD via matching upper and lower bounds. These bounds are dominated by the most "costly" set of obstacles that the algorithm may need to overcome to reach a global minimizer from a given initialization, coupling in this way the global geometry of the underlying loss landscape with the statistics of the noise entering the process. Finally, motivated by applications to the training of deep neural networks, we also provide a series of refinements and extensions of our analysis for loss functions with shallow local minima.</description>

      <title>PARQ: Piecewise-Affine Regularized Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a principled method for quantization-aware training (QAT) of large-scale machine learning models. Specifically, we show that convex, piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) can effectively induce the model parameters to cluster towards discrete values. We minimize PAR-regularized loss functions using an aggregate proximal stochastic gradient method (AProx) and prove that it has last-iterate convergence. Our approach provides an interpretation of the straight-through estimator (STE), a widely used heuristic for QAT, as the asymptotic form of PARQ. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that PARQ obtains competitive performance on convolution- and transformer-based vision tasks.</description>

Abstract: By letting local clients perform multiple local updates before communicating with a parameter server, modern federated learning algorithms such as FedAvg tackle the communication bottleneck problem in distributed learning and have found many successful applications. However, this asynchrony between local updates and communication also leads to a ''client-drift'' problem when the data is heterogeneous (not independent and identically distributed), resulting in errors in the final learning result. In this paper, we propose a federated learning algorithm, which is called FedCET, to ensure accurate convergence even under heterogeneous distributions of data across clients. Inspired by the distributed optimization algorithm NIDS, we use learning rates to weight information received from local clients to eliminate the ''client-drift''. We prove that under appropriate learning rates, FedCET can ensure linear convergence to the exact solution. Different from existing algorithms which have to share both gradients and a drift-correction term to ensure accurate convergence under heterogeneous data distributions, FedCET only shares one variable, which significantly reduces communication overhead. Numerical comparison with existing counterpart algorithms confirms the effectiveness of FedCET.</description>

      <title>Representation of Global Viscosity Solutions for Tonelli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Lax-Oleinik operator $\mathcal{T}$ associated with the non-stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation $\partial_tu + H(t,x,\partial_xu) = \alpha_0$ for a Tonelli Hamiltonian $H$ and its \Mane critical value $\alpha_0$. It is known from the work of A. Fathi and J.N. Mather \cite{MR1792479} that the convergence of this semigroup fails in the non-autonomous framework.
  In this context, we study the action of $\mathcal{T}$ on its non-wandering set $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$. First, we show that $\mathcal{T}$ acts as an isometry on this set, and then we characterize $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as the set of global viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, i.e. solutions that are defined for all real times.
  Next, we introduce a generalized Peierls barrier $\underline{k}$ and a set of generalized static classes $\underline{\mathbb{M}}$ within the Mather set. Using these, we represent elements $u$ of $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as
  \begin{equation*}
  u(x) = \inf_{y \in \underline{\mathbb{M}}} \{ u(y) + \underline{k}(y,x) \}
  \end{equation*}
  We apply this representation formula to prove Fathi's convergence theorem for autonomous systems and provide a representation formula for $n$-periodic viscosity solutions. Additionally, we establish that the dynamics of non-wandering viscosity solutions are governed by the Lagrangian flow on the Mather set. Specifically, we show that if the Mather set consists solely of $N$-periodic orbits for some integer $N$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are $N$-periodic. Furthermore, we show that if the restriction of the Lagrangian flow to the Mather set is uniformly recurrent for a time sequence $p_n$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are uniformly recurrent for the same time sequence $p_n$.</description>

      <title>Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge. Such an operation calls for an energy management system that decides the set points of the primary control layer in the best way possible. This has to fulfill user requirements, minimize costs, and balance local generation with energy storage. Such storage enables building flexibility. This paper presents a novel aging-aware strategy for electrified buildings. The energy management algorithm presented incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between the grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed algorithm can be used to improve grid costs or to protect the batteries (static or electric vehicles). This energy management algorithm can control different cathode chemistries as well as aged and fresh batteries, improving costs with respect to benchmarks for these cases.</description>

      <title>Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-FEM approximation with uniform conservation of the exponential stability for a class of anisotropic port-Hamiltonian system and its application to LQ control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a mixed finite element discretization for a class of boundary-damped anisotropic port-Hamiltonian systems. Using a multiplier method, we demonstrate that the resulting approximation model uniformly preserves the exponential stability of the uncontrolled system, establishing a lower bound for the exponential decay rate that is independent of the mesh size. This property is illustrated through the spatial discretization of a piezoelectric beam. Furthermore, we show how the uniform preservation of exponential stability by the proposed model aids in the convergence of controllers derived from an infinite-time linear quadratic control design, in comparison to models obtained from the standard finite-element method.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop Smoothed Gradient Descent-Ascent Algorithm for Nonconvex-Concave Min-Max Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.15768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonconvex-concave min-max problem arises in many machine learning applications including minimizing a pointwise maximum of a set of nonconvex functions and robust adversarial training of neural networks. A popular approach to solve this problem is the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm which unfortunately can exhibit oscillation in case of nonconvexity. In this paper, we introduce a "smoothing" scheme which can be combined with GDA to stabilize the oscillation and ensure convergence to a stationary solution. We prove that the stabilized GDA algorithm can achieve an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity for minimizing the pointwise maximum of a finite collection of nonconvex functions. Moreover, the smoothed GDA algorithm achieves an $O(1/\epsilon^4)$ iteration complexity for general nonconvex-concave problems. Extensions of this stabilized GDA algorithm to multi-block cases are presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for a class of nonconvex-concave problem. We illustrate the practical efficiency of the stabilized GDA algorithm on robust training.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Primal-Dual Correction Method for Saddle-Point Problems with a Nonlinear Coupling Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The saddle-point problems (SPPs) with nonlinear coupling operators frequently arise in various control systems, such as dynamic programming optimization, H-infinity control, and Lyapunov stability analysis. However, traditional primal-dual methods are constrained by fixed regularization factors. In this paper, a novel generalized primal-dual correction method (GPD-CM) is proposed to adjust the values of regularization factors dynamically. It turns out that this method can achieve the minimum theoretical lower bound of regularization factors, allowing for larger step sizes under the convergence condition being satisfied. The convergence of the GPD-CM is directly achieved through a unified variational framework. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method can achieve an ergodic convergence rate of $O(1/t)$. Numerical results support our theoretical analysis for an SPP with an exponential coupling operator.</description>

      <title>Path constrained unbalanced optimal transport</title>

Abstract: Dynamical formulations of optimal transport (OT) frame the task of comparing distributions as a variational problem which searches for a path between distributions minimizing a kinetic energy functional. In applications, it is frequently natural to require paths of distributions to satisfy additional conditions. Inspired by this, we introduce a model for dynamical OT which incorporates constraints on the space of admissible paths into the framework of unbalanced OT, where the source and target measures are allowed to have a different total mass. Our main results establish, for several general families of constraints, the existence of solutions to the variational problem which defines this path constrained unbalanced optimal transport framework. These results are primarily concerned with distributions defined on a Euclidean space, but we extend them to distributions defined over parallelizable Riemannian manifolds as well. We also consider metric properties of our framework, showing that, for certain types of constraints, our model defines a metric on the relevant space of distributions. This metric is shown to arise as a geodesic distance of a Riemannian metric, obtained through an analogue of Otto's submersion in the classical OT setting.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Fast Krasnoselkii-Mann Methods for Finite-Sum Root-Finding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new class of fast Krasnoselkii--Mann methods with variance reduction to solve a finite-sum co-coercive equation $Gx = 0$. Our algorithm is single-loop and leverages a new family of unbiased variance-reduced estimators specifically designed for a wider class of root-finding algorithms. Our method achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ last-iterate convergence rates in terms of $\mathbb{E}[\| Gx^k\|^2]$, where $k$ is the iteration counter and $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the total expectation. We also establish almost sure $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates $\{x^k\}$ to a solution of $Gx=0$. We instantiate our framework for two prominent estimators: SVRG and SAGA. By an appropriate choice of parameters, both variants attain an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n + n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-1})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-solution, where $n$ represents the number of summands in the finite-sum operator $G$. Furthermore, under $\sigma$-strong quasi-monotonicity, our method achieves a linear convergence rate and an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+ \max\{n, n^{2/3}\kappa\} \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$, where $\kappa := L/\sigma$. We extend our approach to solve a class of finite-sum inclusions (possibly nonmonotone), demonstrating that our schemes retain the same theoretical guarantees as in the equation setting. Finally, numerical experiments validate our algorithms and demonstrate their promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polyhedron is pointed if it contains at least one vertex. Every pointed polyhedron P in R^n can be described by an H-representation consisting of half spaces or equivalently by a V-representation consisting of the convex hull of a set of vertices and extreme rays. We can define matrices H(P) and V(P), each with n + 1 columns, that encode these representations. Define polyhedron Q by setting H(Q)=V(P). We show that Q is the polar of P. Call P HV-symmetric if V(Q) in turn encodes the H-representation of P. It is well known and often stated that polytopes that contain the origin in their interior and pointed polyhedral cones are HV-symmetric. It seems to be less well known that, more generally, a polyhedron is HV-symmetric if and only if it contains the origin. We show this using Minkowski's bipolar equation and discuss implications for the vertex and facet enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Pareto Control Barrier Function for Inner Safe Set Maximization Under Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces the Pareto Control Barrier Function (PCBF) algorithm to maximize the inner safe set of dynamical systems under input constraints. Traditional Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) ensure safety by maintaining system trajectories within a safe set but often fail to account for realistic input constraints. To address this problem, we leverage the Pareto multi-task learning framework to balance competing objectives of safety and safe set volume. The PCBF algorithm is applicable to high-dimensional systems and is computationally efficient. We validate its effectiveness through comparison with Hamilton-Jacobi reachability for an inverted pendulum and through simulations on a 12-dimensional quadrotor system. Results show that the PCBF consistently outperforms existing methods, yielding larger safe sets and ensuring safety under input constraints.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of degenerate mean field games (MFGs) with state-distribution dependent and unbounded functional diffusion coefficients. With a probabilistic method, we study the well-posedness of the forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) associated with the MFG and arising from the maximum principle, and estimate the corresponding Jacobian and Hessian flows. We further establish the classical regularity of the value functional $V$; in particular, we show that when the cost function is $C^3$ in the spatial and control variables and $C^2$ in the distribution argument, then the value functional is $C^1$ in time and $C^2$ in the spatial and distribution variables. As a consequence, the value functional $V$ is the unique classical solution of the degenerate MFG master equation.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex optimization problems with nonlinear equality constraints. We assume that the objective function and the functional constraints are locally smooth. To solve this problem, we introduce a linearized $\ell_q$ penalty based method, where $q \in (1,2]$ is the parameter defining the norm used in the construction of the penalty function. Our method involves linearizing the objective function and functional constraints in a Gauss-Newton fashion at the current iteration in the penalty formulation and introduces a quadratic regularization. This approach yields an easily solvable subproblem, whose solution becomes the next iterate. By using a novel dynamic rule for the choice of the regularization parameter, we establish that the iterates of our method converge to an $\epsilon$-first-order solution in $\mathcal{O}(1/{\epsilon^{2+ (q-1)/q}})$ outer iterations. Finally, we put theory into practice and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by making numerical comparisons with existing methods from literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for constructing first-order projected algorithms for optimization problems with general set constraints, building upon their unconstrained counterparts. We show that these projected algorithms retain the same linear convergence rate bounds, when the latter are obtained for the unconstrained algorithms via quadratic Lyapunov functions arising from integral quadratic constraint (IQC) characterizations. This result is derived by showing that the projection considered remains invariant under a linear transformation induced by the Lyapunov matrix, which allows to establish contraction properties for the composite mapping induced by this transformation. Our results indicate that, when analyzing worst-case convergence rates or when synthesizing first-order optimization algorithms with potentially higher-order dynamics, it suffices to focus solely on the unconstrained dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we shed new light on a classical scheduling problem: given a slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule. Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services, can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near practical viability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give universal bounds on the fraction of nontrivial zeros having given multiplicity for L-functions attached to a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m/\mathbb{Q}$. For this, we apply the higher-level correlation asymptotic of Hejhal and Rudnick &amp; Sarnak in conjunction with semidefinite programming bounds.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for the Pathwise Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features $d$ is possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from D\"urr and Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). In order to do so, we approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine. As another main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are only approximately computed. Furthermore, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on $n$, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on $d$. Moreover, we propose a dequantised version of our quantum algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on $n$, albeit presenting the linear scaling on $d$ from the standard LARS algorithm. Finally, we prove query lower bounds for classical and quantum Lasso algorithms.</description>

      <title>Computation of Robust Option Prices via Structured Multi-Marginal Martingale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient computational framework for solving a class of multi-marginal martingale optimal transport problems, which includes many robust pricing problems of large financial interest. Such problems are typically computationally challenging due to the martingale constraint, however, by extending the state space we can identify them with problems that exhibit a certain sequential martingale structure. Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularisation, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.</description>

      <title>Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decision Focused Learning under Imprecise Uncertainty--Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision Focused Learning has emerged as a critical paradigm for integrating machine learning with downstream optimisation. Despite its promise, existing methodologies predominantly rely on probabilistic models and focus narrowly on task objectives, overlooking the nuanced challenges posed by epistemic uncertainty, non-probabilistic modelling approaches, and the integration of uncertainty into optimisation constraints. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing innovative frameworks: (i) a non-probabilistic lens for epistemic uncertainty representation, leveraging intervals (the least informative uncertainty model), Contamination (hybrid model), and probability boxes (the most informative uncertainty model); (ii) methodologies to incorporate uncertainty into constraints, expanding Decision-Focused Learning's utility in constrained environments; (iii) the adoption of Imprecise Decision Theory for ambiguity-rich decision-making contexts; and (iv) strategies for addressing sparse data challenges. Empirical evaluations on benchmark optimisation problems demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in improving decision quality and robustness and dealing with said gaps.</description>

      <title>A shape-optimization approach for inverse diffusion problems using a single boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the reconstruction of a space-dependent parameter in inverse diffusion problems, proposing a shape-optimization-based approach. The main objective is to recover the absorption coefficient from a single boundary measurement. While conventional gradient-based methods rely on the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a cost functional with respect to the unknown parameter, we also utilize its shape derivative with respect to the unknown boundary interface for recovery. This non-conventional approach addresses the problem of parameter recovery from a single measurement, which represents the key innovation of this work. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, even for intricate and non-convex boundary interfaces.</description>
