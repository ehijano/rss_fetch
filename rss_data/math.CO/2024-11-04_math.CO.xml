      <title>Minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of distance-regular and signed Johnson graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues over a collection of matrices associated with a graph. Lower bounds are derived based on the existence or non-existence of certain cycle(s) in a graph. A key result proves that every Johnson graph has a signed variant with exactly two distinct eigenvalues. We also explore applications to weighing matrices, linear ternary codes, tight frames, and compute the minimum rank of Johnson graphs. Further results involve the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues for graphs in association schemes, distance-regular graphs, and Hamming graphs. We also draw some connections with simplicial complexes and higher-order Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Inverse eigenvalue problem for Laplacian matrices of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, we aim to determine the possible realizable spectra for a generalized (or sometimes referred to as a weighted) Laplacian matrix associated with $G$. This specialized inverse eigenvalue problem is considered for certain families of graphs and graphs on a small number of vertices. Related considerations include studying the possible ordered multiplicity lists associated with stars and complete graphs and graphs with a few vertices. Finally, we investigate the both theoretically and numerically, the minimum variance over a family of generalized Laplacian matrices with a size-normalized weighting.</description>

      <title>Treewidth 2 in the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every planar graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2\boxtimes K_2$ for some graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ both with treewidth 2. This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leq 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>

      <title>Semirigidity and the enumeration of nilpotent semigroups of index three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the belief that `almost all' finite semigroups, whether we consider multiplication operations on a fixed set or their isomorphism classes, are nilpotent of index 3 (3-nilpotent for short). The only known method for counting all semigroups of given order is exhaustive testing, but formulae exist for the numbers of 3-nilpotent ones, and it is also known that `almost all' of these are rigid (have only trivial automorphism).
  Here we express the number of distinct 3-nilpotent semigroup operations on a fixed set of cardinality $n$ as a sum of Stirling numbers, and provide a new expression for the number of isomorphism classes of 3-nilpotent semigroups of cardinality $n$. We introduce a notion of semirigidity for semigroups (as a generalization of rigidity) and find computationally tractable formulae giving an upper bound for the number of pairwise non-isomorphic semirigid 3-nilpotent semigroups, and thus an improved lower bound for the number of all 3-nilpotent semigroups up to isomorphism. Analogous formulae are also developed for isomorphism classes such as commutative and self-dual semigroups, and for equivalence classes (isomorphic or anti-isomorphic). The method relies on an application of the theory of orbit counting in permutation group actions. Our main results are accompanied by tables containing values of these numbers and bounds up to $n=10$ with computations carried out in GAP (but perfectly feasible well beyond this value of $n$).</description>

      <title>An alternating colouring function on strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternating colouring function is defined on strings over the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$. It divides the strings in colourable and non-colourable ones. The points in the subshift of finite type defined by forbidding all non-colourable strings of a certain length alternate between states of one colour and states of the other colour. In other words, the points in the 2nd power shifts all have the same colour. The number $K_n$ of non-colourable strings of length $n \ge 2$ is shown to be $2 \cdot (J_{n-2} + 1)$ where $J$ is the sequence of Jacobsthal numbers. The number of sources and sinks in the de Bruijn graph of dimension $n \ge 3$ with non-colourable edges removed is shown each to be $K_n - 4$.</description>

      <title>PatternBoost: Constructions in Mathematics with a Little Help from AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PatternBoost, a flexible method for finding interesting constructions in mathematics. Our algorithm alternates between two phases. In the first ``local'' phase, a classical search algorithm is used to produce many desirable constructions. In the second ``global'' phase, a transformer neural network is trained on the best such constructions. Samples from the trained transformer are then used as seeds for the first phase, and the process is repeated. We give a detailed introduction to this technique, and discuss the results of its application to several problems in extremal combinatorics. The performance of PatternBoost varies across different problems, but there are many situations where its performance is quite impressive. Using our technique, we find the best known solutions to several long-standing problems, including the construction of a counterexample to a conjecture that had remained open for 30 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set $D_{f}\subseteq V(G)$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is called a \emph{dom-forcing set} if the sub-graph induced by $\langle D_{f} \rangle$ must form a zero forcing set. The minimum cardinality of such a set is known as the dom-forcing number of the graph $G$, denoted by $F_{d}(G)$. This article embarks on an exploration of the dom-forcing number of a graph $G$. Additionally, it delves into the precise determination of $F_{d}(G)$ for certain well-known graphs</description>

      <title>Maximal Circular Point Sets over Arbitrary Fields and an Application to Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of rational point sets on circles over the Euclidean plane is discussed in a more general framework, i.e. we generalize the notion rational and consider these circular point sets over arbitrary fields. We also determine the cardinality of maximal circular point sets which depends on the radius of the corresponding circle and the characteristic of the underlying field. For the construction of them we use the so called perfect distances which have the necessary compatibility properties to find new points on a circle such that all these points still have rational distance from each other. Then we define the rotation group where its elements are the points on a circle over an arbitrary field and find a connection between a subgroup of it and perfect distances if our field is a prime field. Furthermore, we describe a possible application in cryptography of the rotation group similar to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</description>

      <title>10-list Recoloring of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a planar graph $G$ and a list-assignment $L$ with $|L(v)|=10$ for all $v\in V(G)$. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be $L$-colorings of $G$. A recoloring sequence from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is a sequence of $L$-colorings, beginning with $\alpha$ and ending with $\beta$, such that each successive pair in the sequence differs in the color on a single vertex of $G$. We show that there exists a constant $C$ such that for all choices of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ there exists a recoloring sequence $\sigma$ from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ that recolors each vertex at most $C$ times. In particular, $\sigma$ has length at most $C|V(G)|$. This confirms a conjecture of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Feghali. For our proof, we introduce a new technique for quickly showing that many configurations are reducible. We believe this method may be of independent interest and will have application to other problems in this area.</description>

      <title>New classes of reversible cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Boolean function $f$ on $k$~bits induces a shift-invariant vectorial Boolean function $F$ from $n$ bits to $n$ bits for every $n\geq k$. If $F$ is bijective for every $n$, we say that $f$ is a proper lifting, and it is known that proper liftings are exactly those functions that arise as local rules of reversible cellular automata. We construct new families of such liftings for arbitrary large $k$ and discuss whether all have been identified for $k\leq 6$.</description>

Abstract: We give an operadic interpretation of the known result of L.Shapiro and A.B.Stephens that characterizes percolating permutation matrices. A relation of ideals and suboperads of the non-symmetric operad of permutations to percolative properties of sets in the 2-neighbor percolation process is discussed. On a related note, we discuss a certain presentation of the operad of permutations.</description>

      <title>RPS: A Generic Reservoir Patterns Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient learning from streaming data is important for modern data analysis due to the continuous and rapid evolution of data streams. Despite significant advancements in stream pattern mining, challenges persist, particularly in managing complex data streams like sequential and weighted itemsets. While reservoir sampling serves as a fundamental method for randomly selecting fixed-size samples from data streams, its application to such complex patterns remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce an approach that harnesses a weighted reservoir to facilitate direct pattern sampling from streaming batch data, thus ensuring scalability and efficiency. We present a generic algorithm capable of addressing temporal biases and handling various pattern types, including sequential, weighted, and unweighted itemsets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its ability to construct accurate incremental online classifiers for sequential data. Our approach not only enables previously unusable online machine learning models for sequential data to achieve accuracy comparable to offline baselines but also represents significant progress in the development of incremental online sequential itemset classifiers.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Discrete Potentials of Spherical (k,k)-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive universal lower and upper bounds for max-min and min-max problems (also known as polarization) for the potential of spherical $(k,k)$-designs and provide certain examples, including unit-norm tight frames, that attain these bounds. The universality is understood in the sense that the bounds hold for all spherical $(k,k)$-designs and for a large class of potential functions, and the bounds involve certain nodes and weights that are independent of the potential. When the potential function is $h(t)=t^{2k}$, we prove an optimality property of the spherical $(k,k)$-designs in the class of all spherical codes of the same cardinality both for max-min and min-max potential problems.</description>

Abstract: A graph is called integral if its eigenvalues are integers. In this article, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Cayley graph over a finite symmetric algebra $R$ to be integral. This generalizes the work of So who studies the case where $R$ is the ring of integers modulo $n.$ We also explain some number-theoretic constructions of finite symmetric algebras arising from global fields, which we hope could pave the way for future studies on Paley graphs associated with a finite Hecke character.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study higher homological properties of $n$-levelled algebras and connect them to properties of the underlying graphs. Notably, to each $2$-representation-finite quadratic monomial algebra $\Lambda$ we associate a bipartite graph $\overline{B_{\Lambda}}$ and we classify all such algebras $\Lambda$ for which $\overline{B_{\Lambda}}$ is regular or edge-transitive. We also show that if $\overline{B_{\Lambda}}$ is semi-regular, then it is a reflexive graph.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from genomic data of extant taxa, providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus lacking direct support from the observed data. In contrast, LCA vertices represent ancestral states substantiated by the data, offering important insights into evolutionary relationships among subsets of taxa. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>

Abstract: An important conjecture in additive combinatorics, number theory, and algebraic geometry posits that the partition rank and analytic rank of tensors are equal up to a constant, over any finite field. We prove the conjecture up to a logarithmic factor.
  Our proof is largely independent of previous work, utilizing recursively constructed polynomial identities and random walks on zero sets of polynomials. We also introduce a new, vector-valued notion of tensor rank (``local rank''), which serves as a bridge between partition and analytic rank, and which may be of independent interest as a tool for analyzing higher-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Self-adhesivity in lattices of abstract conditional independence models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic concept of the frame for abstract conditional independence (CI) models, together with basic operations with respect to which such a frame should be closed: copying and marginalization. Three standard examples of such frames are (discrete) probabilistic CI structures, semi-graphoids and structural semi-graphoids. We concentrate on those frames which are closed under the operation of set-theoretical intersection because, for these, the respective families of CI models are lattices. This allows one to apply the results from lattice theory and formal concept analysis to describe such families in terms of implications among CI statements.
  The central concept of this paper is that of self-adhesivity defined in algebraic terms, which is a combinatorial reflection of the self-adhesivity concept studied earlier in context of polymatroids and information theory. The generalization also leads to a self-adhesivity operator defined on the hyper-level of CI frames. We answer some of the questions related to this approach and raise other open questions.
  The core of the paper is in computations. The combinatorial approach to computation might overcome some memory and space limitation of software packages based on polyhedral geometry, in particular, if SAT solvers are utilized. We characterize some basic CI families over 4 variables in terms of canonical implications among CI statements. We apply our method in information-theoretical context to the task of entropic region demarcation over 5 variables.</description>

      <title>On an $n$-ary generalization of the Lie representation and tree Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study, initiated in our prior work with Richard Stanley, of the representation of the symmetric group on the multilinear component of an $n$-ary generalization of the free Lie algebra known as the free Filippov $n$-algebra with $k$ brackets. Our ultimate aim is to determine the multiplicities of the irreducible representations in this representation. This had been done for the ordinary Lie representation ($n=2$ case) by Kraskiewicz and Weyman. The $k=2$ case was handled in our prior work, where the representation was shown to be isomorphic to $S^{2^{n-1}1}$. In this paper, for general $n$ and $k$, we obtain decomposition results that enable us to determine the multiplicities in the $k=3$ and $k=4$ cases. In particular we prove that in the $k=3$ case, the representation is isomorphic to $S^{3^{n-1}1} \oplus S^{3^{n-2}21^2}$. Our main result shows that the multiplicities stabilize in a certain sense when $n$ exceeds $k$. As an important tool in proving this, we present two types of generalizations of the notion of Specht module that involve trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zonoids are Hausdorff limits of zonotopes, while zonotopes are convex polytopes defined as the Minkowski sums of finitely many segments. We present a combinatorial framework that links the study of mixed volumes of zonoids (a topic that has applications in algebraic combinatorics) with the study of the absolute value of the Grassmannian, defined as the image of the Grassmannian under the coordinate-wise absolute value map. We use polyhedral computations to derive new families of inequalities for n zonoids in dimension d, when (n,d)=(6,2) and (6,3). Unlike the classical geometric inequalities, originating from the Brunn-Minkowski and Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequalities, the inequalities we produce have the special feature of being Minkowski linear in each of the n zonoids they involve.</description>

      <title>Strongly connected orientations and integer lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D=(V,A)$ be a digraph whose underlying graph is $2$-edge-connected, and let $P$ be the polytope whose vertices are the incidence vectors of arc sets whose reversal makes $D$ strongly connected. We study the lattice theoretic properties of the integer points contained in a proper face $F$ of $P$ not contained in $\{x:x_a=i\}$ for any $a\in A,i\in \{0,1\}$. We prove under a mild necessary condition that $F\cap \{0,1\}^A$ contains an integral basis $B$, i.e., $B$ is linearly independent, and any integral vector in the linear hull of $F$ is an integral linear combination of $B$. This result is surprising as the integer points in $F$ do not necessarily form a Hilbert basis. In proving the result, we develop a theory similar to Matching Theory for degree-constrained dijoins in bipartite digraphs. Our result has consequences for head-disjoint strong orientations in hypergraphs, and also to a famous conjecture by Woodall that the minimum size of a dicut of $D$, say $\tau$, is equal to the maximum number of disjoint dijoins. We prove a relaxation of this conjecture, by finding for any prime number $p\geq 2$, a $p$-adic packing of dijoins of value $\tau$ and of support size at most $2|A|$. We also prove that the all-ones vector belongs to the lattice generated by $F\cap \{0,1\}^A$, where $F$ is the face of $P$ satisfying $x(\delta^+(U))=1$ for every minimum dicut $\delta^+(U)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected, where $\Gamma_3$ is the graph obtained by joining two vertex-disjoint triangles with a path of length $3$. This resolves one of the two last open cases in the characterization of pairs of connected forbidden subgraphs implying Hamilton-connectedness. The proof is based on a new closure technique, developed in a previous paper, and on a structural analysis of small subgraphs, cycles and paths in line graphs of multigraphs. The most technical steps of the analysis are computer-assisted.

      <title>Some Results on Local Distance Antimagic Chromatic Number of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G=(V,E) be a graph of order n without isolated vertices. A bijection f:V -- {1,2,...n} is called a local distance antimagic labeling if the weights of any two adjacent vertices are not equal, where the weight of a vertex is defined to be the sum of labels of adjacent vertices. The local distance antimagic chromatic number is defined to be the minimum number of colors taken over all colorings of G induced by local distance antimagic labelings of G. In this paper, we study the local distance antimagic chromatic number for the join of graphs and the lexicographic product of graphs with empty graphs.</description>

      <title>Zero Forcing and Vertex Independence Number on Cubic and Subcubic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture from the automated conjecturing program TxGraffiti, in this paper the relationship between the zero forcing number, $Z(G)$, and the vertex independence number, $\alpha(G)$, of cubic and subcubic graphs is explored. TxGraffiti conjectures that for all connected cubic graphs $G$, that are not $K_4$, $Z(G) \leq \alpha(G) + 1$. This work uses decycling partitions of upper-embeddable graphs to show that almost all cubic graphs satisfy $Z(G) \leq \alpha(G) + 2$, provides an infinite family of cubic graphs where $Z(G) = \alpha(G) + 1$, and extends known bounds to subcubic graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes some preliminary observations towards an extension of current work on graphs defined on groups to simplicial complexes. I define a variety of simplicial complexes on a group which are preserved by automorphisms of the group, and in many cases have a relation to familiar graphs on the group. The ones which seem to reach deepest into the graph structure are two forms of independence complex, and some results on the class of groups for which these two complexes coincide are given. Other examples are treated more briefly.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with full difference sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of a finite set, define $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\{F\setminus F': F, F'\in\mathcal{F}\}$. A family $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\not=\emptyset$ for all $F, F'\in\mathcal{F}$. Frankl \cite{Frankl} showed that for a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ with $n\ge k(k+3)$, $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ reaches the maximum if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $k$-uniform full star. Later, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} improved the bound $n\ge k(k+3)$ in the above result of Frankl \cite{Frankl} to $n\ge 50klnk$ for $k\ge 50$. For $2k&lt;n&lt;4k$, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} showed that there exists a $k$-uniform family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ such that $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ is larger than $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})|$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a full star. This result left the case $n=2k$ open and we show that $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ can be `full' for some $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$. It is clear that for an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$, $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})\subseteq \cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. We say that a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ has full differences if $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. For odd $k$, Frankl \cite{Frankl} gave a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$, and he asked for even $k\ge 4$ whether there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$. We answer this question in a stronger form and show that for even $k\ge 4$, there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences.</description>

      <title>A model of random sequential adsorption on a ladder graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In random sequential adsorption (RSA), objects are deposited on a substrate randomly, irreversibly, and sequentially. Attempts of deposition that lead to an overlap with previously deposited objects are discarded. The process continues until the system reaches a jammed state when no further additions are possible. We analyze a class of RSA models on a two-row square ladder graph in which landing on an empty site in a graph is allowed when at least $b$ neighboring sites in the graph are unoccupied ($b \in \mathbb{N}$). In this paper we complement this typical way of studying RSA models by analyzing also the structure of the set of all jammed states in a static way, disregarding the dynamics that led to a particular jammed state. In both considered settings (dynamic and static) we provide explicit expressions for key statistics that describe the average proportion of the substrate covered by deposited objects, and then we comment on significant differences between the two settings. We illustrate all of our findings through a toy model for ensembles of trapped Rydberg atoms with blockade range $b$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step walks and $3$-step closed walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  Using a diagram technique, we show that the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in large random graphs. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to the tree-type diagrams obtained, we get explicit expressions for their numbers. This allows us to get upper bounds for ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ as $k\to\infty$ and, in the limit of infinite $q$, to get upper bounds in terms of high moments of Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds and applications I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea to to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with new combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealing process as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.</description>
