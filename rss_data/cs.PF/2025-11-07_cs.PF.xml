      <title>One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA (Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures (ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy. Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures (MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks (ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score, gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.</description>

      <title>OMPILOT: Harnessing Transformer Models for Auto Parallelization to Shared Memory Computing Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Domain-decomposed Monte Carlo Neutral Transport for Nuclear Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code, Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests, with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases. On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.</description>

      <title>SySMOL: Co-designing Algorithms and Hardware for Neural Networks with Heterogeneous Precisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low-precision inference can sharply reduce memory and latency but often degrades accuracy and relies on specialized hardware. We present SONIQ, a system-optimized, noise-injected quantization framework that learns per-channel mixed precision for both weights and activations while training under the same rules used at inference. By injecting hardware-calibrated quantization noise during training, SONIQ steers models toward the discrete arithmetic used at deployment -- without bespoke runtimes. Across CNNs and Transformers, SONIQ achieves up to 16x and 7x compression, respectively, while matching or exceeding full-precision accuracy. Measured end-to-end, SONIQ delivers up to 7.3x CPU speedup over strong INT8 baselines and up to 6.3x (vector units) / 2.8x (tensor cores) GPU speedup relative to FP16. A practical outcome is that two per-channel precision levels -- one in the 1--4-bit range and one in the 4--8-bit range -- suffice in practice; at inference, each channel selects one of the two, keeping kernels simple and fast. To our knowledge, SONIQ is the first framework to reach or surpass full-precision accuracy under ultra-low (1--4 bits per parameter) regimes while remaining deployable on commodity hardware, narrowing the gap between quantization theory and practical, high-throughput inference.</description>

      <title>Quamba2: A Robust and Scalable Post-training Quantization Framework for Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.</description>

      <title>Flashlight: PyTorch Compiler Extensions to Accelerate Attention Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention is a fundamental building block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency. Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently, enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models without sacrificing performance.</description>
