      <title>Asymptotic limits of the attached eddy model derived from an adiabatic atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attached-eddy model (AEM) predicts mean velocity and streamwise velocity variance profiles that follow a logarithmic shape in the overlap region of high Reynolds number wall-bounded turbulent flows. Moreover, the AEM coefficients are presumed to attain asymptotically constant values at very high Reynolds numbers. Here, the logarithmic behaviour of the AEM predictions in the near-neutral atmospheric surface layer is examined using sonic anemometer measurements from a 62-m meteorological tower located in the Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho, US. Utilizing an extensive 210-day dataset, the inertial sublayer (ISL) is first identified by analyzing the measured momentum flux and mean velocity profile. The logarithmic behaviour of the streamwise velocity variance and the associated `-1' scaling of the streamwise velocity energy spectra are then investigated. The findings indicate that the Townsend-Perry coefficient ($A_1$) is influenced by mild non-stationarity that manifests itself as a Reynolds number dependence. After excluding non-stationary runs and requiring a Reynolds number higher than $4 \times 10^7$, the inferred $A_1$ converges to values ranging between 1 and 1.25, consistent with laboratory experiments. Moreover, the independence of the normalized vertical velocity variance from the wall-normal distance in the ISL is further checked and the constant coefficient value agrees with reported laboratory experiments at very high Reynolds numbers as well as many surface layer experiments. Furthermore, nine benchmark cases selected through a restrictive quality control reveal a closer relationship between the `-1' scaling in the streamwise velocity energy spectrum and the logarithmic behaviour of streamwise velocity variance at higher Reynolds numbers, though no direct equivalence between them is observed.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for topological waves in continuum fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional continuum fluids with odd viscosity under a chiral body force. The chiral body force makes the low-energy excitation spectrum of the fluids gapped, and the odd viscosity allows us to introduce the first Chern number of each energy band in the fluids. Employing a mapping between hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1) gauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge theory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term associated with odd viscosity. We then solve the equations of motion for the gauge fields concretely in the presence of the boundary and find edge-mode solutions. We finally discuss the fate of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in the context of continuum systems.</description>
