      <title>Semi-vortex solitons and their excited states in spin-orbit-coupled binary bosonic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that two-dimensional two-component fundamental solitons of the semi-vortex (SV) type, with vorticities $(s_{+},s_{-})=(0,1)$ in their components, are stable ground states (GSs) in the spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) binary Bose-Einstein condensate with the contact self-attraction acting in both components, in spite of the possibility of the critical collapse in the system. However, excited states(ESs) of the SV solitons, with the vorticity set $(s_{+},s_{-})=( S_{+},S_{+}+1)$ and $S_{+}=1,2,3,...$, are unstable in the same system. We construct ESs of SV solitons in the SOC system with opposite signs of the self-interaction in the two components. The main finding is stability of the ES-SV solitons, with the extra vorticity (at least) up to $S_{+}=6$. The threshold value of the norm for the onset of the critical collapse, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$, in these excited states is higher than the commonly known critical value, $N_{c}\approx 5.85$,associated with the single-component Townes solitons, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$ increasing with the growth of $S_{+}$. A velocity interval for stable motion of the GS-SV solitons is found too. The results suggest a solution for the challenging problem of the creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges.</description>

      <title>Signature of reentrant localization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the appearance of reentrant localization in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasiperiodic optical lattice in the presence of collisional inhomogeneity. We introduce the inhomogeneity of the spatial modulation of nonlinear interactions, which have the same nature as those of the quasiperiodic potential. A $\pi/2$ phase shift between the spatial modulation of nonlinearity and the quasiperiodic potential results in the appearance of an intermediate delocalized state sandwiched between two localized regions, a typical signature of reentrant localization. We employ numerical and variational approaches to characterize the structure and dynamics of reentrant localization. We find that the reentrant features appear either upon varying the strength of the inhomogeneity or changing the spin-orbit and Rabi coupling parameters. We further confirm the stability of the localized and delocalized state by performing the dynamical studies of the condensate by perturbing the ground state either through the velocity perturbation or upon quenching the trap strength.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric response of lattice bosonic insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the absence of parity and time-reversal symmetries, insulators can exhibit magnetoelectric responses, in which applied magnetic fields induce charge polarization and, conversely, applied electric fields induce magnetization. While there is a long history of the study of magnetoelectric response in fermionic insulators, the same for bosonic insulators has been limited. We consider the magnetoelectric response in lattice insulators built out of charged bosonic degrees of freedom and derive a bulk formula for the corresponding linear response tensor. The resulting formulae feature several contributions including a Chern-Simons integral over the bands of the bosonic excitations. We construct several minimal microscopic models that illustrate the ingredients required to obtain a sizable bosonic magnetoelectric response. Our formalism can be applied to bosonic Mott insulators subject to synthetic gauge fields and/or tilted potentials as well as to the spinon sector in the Coulomb phase of a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose an analytic criterion for parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) exactness that is applicable in any dimensions with any boundary conditions. we find that the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition identified using this method captures dynamical signatures observable in experiments, aligns with the exceptional point, and is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition, contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson Junctions and Synchronized Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Generalized Dicke Model for Spin-1 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos. In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Exciton-Polariton Condensate Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the electrical control of a device probing the Josephson effect in exciton-polariton (EP) condensates, which can be switched between various dynamical modes. We model the device by a four-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. All the model parameters are calculated microscopically. In particular, we obtain the polariton tunneling strength across the junction as a second-order process of electron-hole pair tunneling. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through distinctive degrees of freedom not present in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are far richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm effect for confined matter in lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field. In particular, we find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the particle-like effect and reflecting the the features of the confining gauge potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems via Auxiliary Particles with Exact Operator Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an auxiliary-particle field theory to treat the non-Markovian dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum systems of the Jaynes-Cummings type. It assigns an individual quantum field to each reservoir state and provides an analytic, faithful representation of the coupled system-bath dynamics. We apply the method to a driven-dissipative photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a reservoir of dye molecules with electronic and vibronic excitations. The complete phase diagram of this system exhibits a hidden, non-Hermitian phase transition separating temporally oscillating from biexponentially decaying photon density correlations within the BEC. On one hand, this provides a qualitative distinction of the thermal photon BEC from a laser. On the other hand, it shows that one may continuously tune from the BEC to the lasing phase by circumventing a critical point. This auxiliary-particle method is generally applicable to the dynamics of open, non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Programmable order by disorder effect and underlying phases through dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study two different quantum simulators through various theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms. When the total magnetization is zero, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Among all possible configurations, we focus on the stripe (up and down spins aligning straightly) and kinked (up and down spins forming zigzag spin chains) patterns. Adopting the real space perturbation theory, we estimate the leading order energy correction when the nearest-neighbor spin exchange coupling, $J$, is considered, and the overall model becomes an effective XXZ model with a spatial anisotropy. Our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting, showing that even when the spin exchange coupling term is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposals indicate realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>The confluence of fractured resonances at points of dynamical, many--body flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant transport occurs when there is a matching of frequencies across some spatial medium, increasing the efficiency of shuttling particles from one reservoir to another. We demonstrate that in a periodically driven, many--body titled lattice, there are sets of spatially fractured resonances. These ``emanate'' from two essential resonances due to scattering off internal surfaces created when the driving frequency and many--body interaction strength vary, a scattering reminiscent of lens flare. The confluence of these fractured resonances dramatically enhances transport. At one confluence, the interaction strength is finite and the essential resonance arises due to the interplay of interaction with the counter--rotating terms of the periodic drive. We discuss the origin and structure of the fractured resonances, as well as the scaling of the conductance with system parameters. These results furnish a new example of the richness of open, driven, many--body systems.</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The peculiar physical properties of these systems mainly originate from their underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In this paper, we present a novel class of $\textit{geometric semimetals}$ in three dimensions. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the nonzero quantum metric trace with possible quantization. The possible realization in synthetic-matter experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Demkov-Kunike (DK) model, characterized by a time-dependent Rabi coupling $J~\text{sech}(t/T)$ and on-site detuning $\Delta_0+\Delta_1\tanh(t/T)$, has one of the most general forms of an exactly solvable two-state quantum system, and, therefore, it provides a paradigm for coherent manipulations of a qubit's quantum state. Despite its extensive applications in the noise-free cases, the exploration of the noisy DK model remains limited. Here, we extend the coherent DK model to take into account of a noisy coupling term $J\rightarrow J_{\text{noisy}}(t)$. We consider colored Markovian noise sources represented by the telegraph noise and Gaussian noise. We present exact solutions for the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ of the noisy DK model, namely the probability of the system to remain in its initial state. For the slow telegraph noise, we identify parameter regimes where the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ is suppressed rather than enhanced by noise. In contrast, for slow Gaussian noise, the noise always enhances the survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$, due to the absorption of noise quanta across the energy gap. This study not only complements the existing research on the noisy Landau-Zener model, but also provides valuable insights for the control of two-level quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An atom-doped photon engine: Extracting mechanical work from a quantum system via radiation pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of efficiently converting heat into work at the microscale has triggered an intense research effort to understand quantum heat engines, driven by the hope of quantum superiority over classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a model featuring an atom-doped optical quantum cavity propelling a classical piston through radiation pressure. The model, based on the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrates the generation of mechanical work through thermal energy injection. We establish the equivalence of the piston expansion work with Alicki's work definition, analytically for quasistatic transformations and numerically for finite time protocols. We further employ the model to construct quantum Otto and Carnot engines, comparing their performance in terms of energetics, work output, efficiency, and power under various conditions. This model thus provides a platform to extract useful work from an open quantum system to generate net motion, and sheds light on the quantum concepts of work and heat.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Circular Rydberg Qubits of Alkaline-Earth Atoms in Optical Tweezers</title>

Abstract: Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.
