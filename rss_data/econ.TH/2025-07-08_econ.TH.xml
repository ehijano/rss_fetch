      <title>A contemporary approach on revisited cost allocation using airport games: the effects of code-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important operational aspect in airport management is the allocation of fees to aircraft movements on a runway, whether operated by separate operators or under code-sharing agreements. This paper analyses the problem of determining fees under code-sharing of the movements at an airport from a game theoretic perspective. In particular, we propose the configuration value for games with coalition configuration as the mechanism for allocating operating costs. We provide the exact expression of this game-theoretic solution for airport games, which depends only on the parameters of the associated airport problem. For this purpose, we consider a new and natural game-theoretic characterization of the configuration value. Finally, for the specific context of airport games, we apply it to a real case as a mechanism to determine the aircraft fees at a Spanish airport in a code-sharing scenario.</description>

      <title>Attraction of the core and the cohesion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a continuous-time dynamical system approach to study the evolution of the state of a game driven by the willingness to reduce the total dissatisfaction of the coalitions about their payment. Inspired by the work of Grabisch and Sudh\"olter about core stability, we define a vector field on the set of preimputations from which is defined, for any preimputation, a cohesion curve describing the evolution of the state. We prove that for each preimputation, there exists a unique cohesion curve. Subsequently, we show that, for the cohesion flow of a balanced game, the core is the unique minimal attractor of the flow, the realm of which is the whole preimputation set. These results improve our understanding of the ubiquity of the core in the study of cooperative games with transferable utility.</description>

      <title>Interactions across multiple games: cooperation, corruption, and organizational design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is socially beneficial for teams to cooperate in some situations (``good games'') and not in others (``bad games;'' e.g., those that allow for corruption). A team's cooperation in any given game depends on expectations of cooperation in future iterations of both good and bad games. We identify when sustaining cooperation on good games necessitates cooperation on bad games. We then characterize how a designer should optimally assign workers to teams and teams to tasks that involve varying arrival rates of good and bad games. Our results show how organizational design can be used to promote cooperation while minimizing corruption.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven approach to Bayesian persuasion. The receiver is privately informed about the prior distribution of the state of the world, the sender knows the receiver's preferences but does not know the distribution of the state variable, and the sender's payoffs depend on the receiver's action but not on the state. Prior to interacting with the receiver, the sender observes the distribution of actions taken by a population of decision makers who share the receiver's preferences in best response to an unobserved distribution of messages generated by an unknown and potentially heterogeneous signal. The sender views any prior that rationalizes this data as plausible and seeks a signal that maximizes her worst-case payoff against the set of all such distributions. We show positively that the two-state many-action problem has a saddle point and negatively that the two-action many-state problem does not. In the former case, we identify adversarial priors and optimal signals. In the latter, we characterize the set of robustly optimal Blackwell experiments.</description>

      <title>Coalitional stability under myopic expectations and externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coalition formation problems in the presence of externalities, focusing on settings where agents exhibit myopic expectations, that is, they evaluate potential deviations based solely on the immediate outcome, assuming no further reactions or reorganization by others. First, we establish a sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of both the core and the stable set. In the case of the core, our condition for ensuring non-emptiness also provides a characterization of all core partitions. We then turn our attention to problems with order-preserving preferences. Under our sufficient condition, the core and the stable set not only exist but also coincide, and convergence to a stable outcome is guaranteed. Furthermore, using the notion of absorbing set, we draw a connection between problems with order-preserving preferences and those without externalities. This allows us to lift known core non-emptiness results from the latter setting to the former, thereby establishing a novel bridge between these two classes of problems.</description>

      <title>Tight Efficiency Bounds for the Probabilistic Serial Mechanism under Cardinal Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Probabilistic Serial (PS) mechanism -- also known as the simultaneous eating algorithm -- is a canonical solution for the assignment problem under ordinal preferences. It guarantees envy-freeness and ordinal efficiency in the resulting random assignment. However, under cardinal preferences, its efficiency may degrade significantly: it is known that PS may yield allocations that are $\Omega(\ln{n})$-worse than Pareto optimal, but whether this bound is tight remained an open question.
  Our first result resolves this question by showing that the PS mechanism guarantees $(\ln(n)+2)$-approximate Pareto efficiency, even in the more general submodular setting introduced by Fujishige, Sano, and Zhan (ACM TEAC 2018). This is established by showing that, although the PS mechanism may incur a loss of up to $O(\sqrt{n})$ in utilitarian social welfare, it still achieves a $(\ln{n}+2)$-approximation to the maximum Nash welfare. In addition, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation which is envy-free and $e^{1/e}$-approximately Pareto-efficient, answering an open question posed by Tr\"obst and Vazirani (EC 2024).
  The PS mechanism also applies to the allocation of chores instead of goods. We prove that it guarantees an $n$-approximately Pareto-efficient allocation in this setting, and that this bound is asymptotically tight. This result provides the first known approximation guarantee for computing a fair and efficient allocation in the assignment problem with chores under cardinal preferences.</description>

      <title>Ex-Ante Truthful Distribution-Reporting Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies mechanism design for revenue maximization in a distribution-reporting setting, where the auctioneer does not know the buyers' true value distributions. Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid distribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the mechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize ex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions. As shown in previous work, classical prior-dependent mechanisms such as the Myerson auction fail to elicit truthful value distributions at the ex-ante stage, despite satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility at the interim stage. We study the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to maximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a family of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive compatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these mechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or approximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically, for any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant fraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue by a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and a tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable by any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a constant factor. Finally, we extend our approach to a setting where multiple units of identical items are sold to buyers with multi-unit demands.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Asset Pricing with {\alpha}-MEU Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic asset pricing problem in which a representative agent is ambiguous about the aggregate endowment growth rate and trades a risky stock, human capital, and a risk-free asset to maximize her preference value of consumption represented by the {\alpha}-maxmin expected utility model. This preference model is known to be dynamically inconsistent, so we consider intra-personal equilibrium strategies for the representative agent and define the market equilibrium as the one in which the strategy that clears the market is an intra-personal equilibrium. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium and show that the asset prices in the equilibrium are the same as in the case when the agent does not perceive any ambiguity but believes in a particular probabilistic model of the endowment process. We show that with reasonable parameter values, the more ambiguity the agent perceives or the more ambiguity-averse she is, the lower the risk-free rate, the higher the stock price, the higher the stock risk premium, and the lower the stock volatility.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Refund Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mechanism design setting with a single item and a single buyer who is uncertain about the value of the item. Both the buyer and the seller have a common model for the buyer's value, but the buyer discovers her true value only upon receiving the item. Mechanisms in this setting can be interpreted as randomized refund mechanisms, which allocate the item at some price and then offer a (partial and/or randomized) refund to the buyer in exchange for the item if the buyer is unsatisfied with her purchase. Motivated by their practical importance, we study the design of optimal deterministic mechanisms in this setting. We characterize optimal mechanisms as virtual value maximizers for both continuous and discrete type settings. We then use this characterization, along with bounds on the menu size complexity, to develop efficient algorithms for finding optimal and near-optimal deterministic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Dutch-Book Trap for Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide Dutch-book arguments against two forms of misspecified Bayesian learning. An agent progressively learns about a state and is offered a bet after every new discovery. We say the agent is Dutch-booked when they are willing to accept all bets, but their payoff is negative under each state either ex-post, or in expectation given the objective conditional probabilities of the discoveries (i.e., the correct data-generating process, DGP). Respectively, an agent cannot be Dutch-booked if and only if they update their beliefs with Bayes rule either from the previous belief, even using misspecified likelihood functions, or from one lexicographic prior, using the correct data-generating process. Under a large population interpretation of the DGP, this means that a population can suffer aggregate losses under all states when different individuals update their beliefs from different (lexicographic) priors, or using misspecified likelihoods. Thus, the Dutch-book argument offers a general characterization of the perils of misspecification.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful feature in mechanism design is the ability to irrevocably commit to the rules of a mechanism. Commitment is achieved by public declaration, which enables players to verify incentive properties in advance and the outcome in retrospect. However, public declaration can reveal superfluous information that the mechanism designer might prefer not to disclose, such as her target function or private costs. Avoiding this may be possible via a trusted mediator; however, the availability of a trustworthy mediator, especially if mechanism secrecy must be maintained for years, might be unrealistic. We propose a new approach to commitment, and show how to commit to, and run, any given mechanism without disclosing it, while enabling the verification of incentive properties and the outcome -- all without the need for any mediators. Our framework utilizes zero-knowledge proofs -- a cornerstone of modern cryptographic theory. Applications include both private-type settings such as auctions and private-action settings such as contracts, as well as non-mediated bargaining with hidden yet binding offers.</description>

      <title>Selling Multiple Complements with Packaging Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a package assignment problem with multiple units of indivisible items. The seller can specify preferences over partitions of their supply between buyers as packaging costs. We propose incremental costs together with a graph that defines cost interdependence to express these preferences. This facilitates the use of linear programming to characterize Walrasian equilibrium prices. Firstly, we show that equilibrium prices are uniform, anonymous, and linear in packages. Prices and marginal gains exhibit a nested structure, which we characterize in closed form for complete graphs. Secondly, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of package-linear competitive prices using an ascending auction implementation. Our framework of partition preferences ensures fair and transparent dual pricing and admits preferences over the concentration of allocated bundles in the market.</description>

Abstract: A designer distributes goods while considering the perceived equity of the resulting allocation. Such concerns are modeled through an equity constraint requiring that equally deserving agents receive equal allocations. I ask what forms of screening are compatible with equity and show that while the designer cannot equitably screen with a single instrument (e.g., payments or ordeals), combining multiple instruments, which on their own favor different groups, allows her to screen while still producing an equitable allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I develop and characterize a random attention model with unobserved reference alternatives. The decision-maker pays attention to different subsets of the available set of alternatives randomly. The reference alternatives are exactly those alternatives that are always paid attention to, i.e. they are attention-privileged. These alternatives are unknown to the outside observer. The characterization allows for a complete identification of the reference alternatives and a coarse identification of the underlying preferences. I then restrict the model by considering the independent random attention function and provide a complete identification of the underlying preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a cheap talk model with one receiver and multiple senders. Each sender observes a noisy signal regarding an unknown state of the world. Existing literature (e.g., Levit and Malenko, 2011; Battaglini, 2017) focuses on scenarios where the receiver and senders have aligned preferences in each state. We further explore situations with disagreement states where the receiver and the senders have misaligned preferences. We first show that, when the number of senders grows large, each sender's message must convey almost no information to the receiver. Furthermore, we identify a discontinuity in information transmission: with moderate conflict between the receiver and the senders, introducing an arbitrarily small probability of disagreement states causes complete unraveling, contrary to complete information transmission predicted by the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the receiver cannot fully learn the state even when receiving messages from arbitrarily many senders.</description>

      <title>Dynamic SINR-Guided Iterative Interference Cancellation for ODDM Systems in Doubly Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has recently gained significant attention as a promising candidate to promote the communication reliability in high-mobility environments. Low complexity signal detection is one of the most significant challenges for ODDM over general physical channels, due to the large channel spreading caused by the fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity data detection for ODDM system by utilizing iterative interference cancellation. Based on the theoretical analysis of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) during the iteration, a dynamic SINR-guided approach is proposed to provide a better initialization result. Specifically, we analyze the SINR of each time domain sample before initial estimate with consideration of off-grid delay and Doppler shifts. The iteration is then started from the multi-carrier symbol index which has the best SINR. The corresponding interference is then eliminated for other time domain samples while the SINR for symbol awaiting detection is also updated. Based on the updated SINR, the next multi-carrier symbol index is selected for the same processing until all data symbols have been initialized. Finally, we update the SINR synchronously until the end of the initialization. Simulation experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms demonstrate satisfying convergence and error performance while avoiding the huge complexity introduced by full linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) initialization.</description>
