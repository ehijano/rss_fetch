      <title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description>

      <title>An IoT Framework for Building Energy Optimization Using Machine Learning-based MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a machine learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for controlling Air Handling Unit (AHU) systems by employing an Internet of Things (IoT) framework. The proposed framework utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to provide dynamic-linear thermal model parameters considering building information and disturbances in real time, thereby facilitating the practical MPC of the AHU system. The proposed framework allows users to establish new setpoints for a closed-loop control system, enabling customization of the thermal environment to meet individual needs with minimal use of the AHU. The experimental results demonstrate the cost benefits of the proposed machine-learning-based MPC-IoT framework, achieving a 57.59\% reduction in electricity consumption compared with a clock-based manual controller while maintaining a high level of user satisfaction. The proposed framework offers remarkable flexibility and effectiveness, even in legacy systems with limited building information, making it a pragmatic and valuable solution for enhancing the energy efficiency and user comfort in pre-existing structures.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of Full-Scale Ship Maneuvering Characteristics During Berthing and Unberthing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging empirical data is crucial in the development of accurate and reliable virtual models for the advancement of autonomous ship technologies and the optimization of port operations. This study presents an in-depth analysis of ship berthing and unberthing maneuvering characteristics by utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing the operation of a full-scale ship in diverse infrastructural and environmental conditions. Various statistical techniques and time-series analysis were employed to process and interpret the operational data. A systematic analysis was conducted on key performance variables, including approach speed, drift angles, turning motions, distance from obstacles, and actuator utilization. The results demonstrate significant discrepancies between the empirical data and the established maneuvering characteristics. These findings have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of conventional maneuvering models, such as the Mathematical Modeling Group (MMG) model, and improve the conditions used in captive model tests for the identification of maneuvering model parameters. Furthermore, these findings could inform the development of more robust autonomous berthing and unberthing algorithms and digital twins.</description>

      <title>Enabling Wireless Communications, Energy Harvesting, and Energy Saving by Using a Multimode Smart Nonlinear Circuit (MSNC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multimode smart nonlinear circuit (MSNC) for wireless communications (Tx and Rx modes) as well as energy harvesting (EH) and power saving is presented. The proposed MSNC is designed at 680 MHz and has three ports, which are connected to an antenna, and T/R (transceiver) and power-saving modules. According to the input/output power level, the proposed MSNC has three modes of operations; Receiving (Rx), power saving and transmitting (Tx), for low (&lt;-25 dBm), mid (&gt;-25 dBm and &lt;0 dBm) and high (&gt;5 dBm) power ranges, respectively. In the power-saving mode, when the received power is greater than the sensitivity of the Rx module, the excess power is directed to the energy harvesting load (power storage), while the receiving direction is still in place. The fact that the proposed MSNC can manage the received power level smartly and without any external control, distinguishes the proposed MSNC from other EH circuits. The proposed MSNC operates within a power range from -50 dBm to +15 dBm, demonstrates an efficiency of more than 60% in the power-saving mode, and has acceptable matching over a large frequency range. The design procedure of the proposed MSNC along with the theoretical, simulation and measurement results are presented in this paper. Good agreement between theory, simulation and measurement results confirms the accuracy of design procedure.</description>

      <title>Learning a Factorized Orthogonal Latent Space using Encoder-only Architecture for Fault Detection; An Alarm management perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False and nuisance alarms in industrial fault detection systems are often triggered by uncertainty, causing normal process variable fluctuations to be erroneously identified as faults. This paper introduces a novel encoder-based residual design that effectively decouples the stochastic and deterministic components of process variables without imposing detection delay. The proposed model employs two distinct encoders to factorize the latent space into two orthogonal spaces: one for the deterministic part and the other for the stochastic part. To ensure the identifiability of the desired spaces, constraints are applied during training. The deterministic space is constrained to be smooth to guarantee determinism, while the stochastic space is required to resemble standard Gaussian noise. Additionally, a decorrelation term enforces the independence of the learned representations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through numerical examples and its application to the Tennessee Eastman process, highlighting its potential for robust fault detection. By focusing decision logic solely on deterministic factors, the proposed model significantly enhances prediction quality while achieving nearly zero false alarms and missed detections, paving the way for improved operational safety and integrity in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Control-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Chemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a control-informed reinforcement learning (CIRL) framework that integrates proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control components into the architecture of deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies. The proposed approach augments deep RL agents with a PID controller layer, incorporating prior knowledge from control theory into the learning process. CIRL improves performance and robustness by combining the best of both worlds: the disturbance-rejection and setpoint-tracking capabilities of PID control and the nonlinear modeling capacity of deep RL. Simulation studies conducted on a continuously stirred tank reactor system demonstrate the improved performance of CIRL compared to both conventional model-free deep RL and static PID controllers. CIRL exhibits better setpoint-tracking ability, particularly when generalizing to trajectories outside the training distribution, suggesting enhanced generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the embedded prior control knowledge within the CIRL policy improves its robustness to unobserved system disturbances. The control-informed RL framework combines the strengths of classical control and reinforcement learning to develop sample-efficient and robust deep reinforcement learning algorithms, with potential applications in complex industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Receding-Horizon Games with Tullock-Based Profit Functions for Electric Ride-Hailing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a receding-horizon, game-theoretic charging planning mechanism for electric ride-hailing markets. As the demand for ride-hailing services continues to surge and governments advocate for stricter environmental regulations, integrating electric vehicles into these markets becomes inevitable. The proposed framework addresses the challenges posed by dynamic demand patterns, fluctuating energy costs, and competitive dynamics inherent in such markets. Leveraging the concept of receding-horizon games, we propose a method to optimize proactive dispatching of vehicles for recharging over a predefined time horizon. We integrate a modified Tullock contest that accounts for customer abandonment due to long waiting times to model the expected market share, and by factoring in the demand-based electricity charging, we construct a game capturing interactions between two companies over the time horizon. For this game, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and then present a semi-decentralized, iterative method to compute it. Finally, the method is evaluated in an open-loop and a closed-loop manner in a simulated numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Integrated Modeling and Forecasting of Electric Vehicles Charging Profiles Based on Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of energy transition and decarbonization of the economy, several governments will ban the sale of new combustion vehicles by 2050. Thus, growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks (DN) is predicted. Impact analyzes must be performed to determine if mitigation means are needed to accommodate a large quantity of EVs in the DN. Furthermore, the habits of the local population resulting in different EVs charging patterns needs to be realistically considered. This article proposed an individual residential EVs multi-charging algorithm based on the observed charging behavior of 500 measured residential EVs located in a large North American utility. Probability functions are derived from the analysis of these charging patterns. These can be used to model daily charging profiles of individual EV to assess, in a quasi-static time-series perspective, their impact either on a single costumer or a whole DN. An impact evaluation study is also presented.</description>

      <title>Watercraft as Overwater Ambulance Exchange Points to Enhance Aeromedical Evacuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambulance exchange points are preidentified sites where patients are transferred between evacuation platforms while en route to enhanced medical care. We propose a new capability for maritime medical evacuation, which involves co-opting underway watercraft as overwater ambulance exchange points to transfer patients between medical evacuation aircraft. We partner with the United States Army's 25th Combat Aviation Brigade to demonstrate the use of an Army watercraft as an overwater ambulance exchange point. A manikin is transferred between two HH-60 Medical Evacuation Black Hawk helicopters conducting hoist operations over Army Logistics Support Vessel 3, which is traveling south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The demonstration is enabled by a decision support system for dispatching aircraft, hoist stabilization technology, commercial satellite internet, military geospatial infrastructure applications, and digital medical documentation tools, the benefits of which are all discussed. Three extensions of the overwater ambulance exchange point are introduced and civilian applications are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the data-based design of controllers that solve the output regulation problem for nonlinear systems. Inspired by recent developments in model-based output regulation design techniques and in data-driven control design for nonlinear systems, we derive a data-dependent semidefinite program that, when solved, directly returns a controller that approximately regulates the tracking error to zero. When specialized to the case of linear systems, the result appears to improve upon existing work. Numerical results illustrate the findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with interconnected networks with non-identical subsystems. We investigate the output consensus of the network where the dynamics are subject to external disturbance and/or reference input. For a network of output-feedback passive subsystems, we first introduce an index that characterises the gap between a pair of adjacent subsystems by the difference of their input-output trajectories. The set of these indices quantifies the level of heterogeneity of the networks. We then provide a condition in terms of the level of heterogeneity and the connectivity of the networks for ensuring the output consensus of the interconnected network.</description>

      <title>Speeding Ticket: Unveiling the Energy and Emission Burden of AI-Accelerated Distributed and Decentralized Power Dispatch Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the modern electrical grid shifts towards distributed systems, there is an increasing need for rapid decision-making tools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies are now pivotal in enhancing the efficiency of power dispatch operations, effectively overcoming the constraints of traditional optimization solvers with long computation times. However, this increased efficiency comes at a high environmental cost, escalating energy consumption and carbon emissions from computationally intensive AI/ML models. Despite their potential to transform power systems management, the environmental impact of these technologies often remains an overlooked aspect. This paper introduces the first comparison of energy demands across centralized, distributed, and decentralized ML-driven power dispatch models. We provide a detailed analysis of the energy and carbon footprint required for continuous operations on an IEEE 33 bus system, highlighting the critical trade-offs between operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study aims to guide future AI implementations in energy systems, ensuring they enhance not only efficiency but also prioritize ecological integrity.</description>

      <title>Active Search for Low-altitude UAV Sensing and Communication for Users at Unknown Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement to ensure line-of-sight (LOS) communication and sensing for a cluster of ground users possibly in deep shadow, while the UAV maintains backhaul connectivity with a base station (BS). The key challenges include unknown user locations, uncertain channel model parameters, and unavailable urban structure. Addressing these challenges, this paper focuses on developing an efficient online search strategy which jointly estimates channels, guides UAV positioning, and optimizes resource allocation. Analytically exploiting the geometric properties of the equipotential surface, this paper develops an LOS discovery trajectory on the equipotential surface while the closed-form search directions are determined using perturbation theory. Since the explicit expression of the equipotential surface is not available, this paper proposes to locally construct a channel model for each user in the LOS regime utilizing polynomial regression without depending on user locations or propagation distance. A class of spiral trajectories to simultaneously construct the LOS channels and search on the equipotential surface is developed. An optimal radius of the spiral and an optimal measurement pattern for channel gain estimation are derived to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the locally constructed channel. Numerical results on real 3D city maps demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves over 95% of the performance of a 3D exhaustive search scheme with just a 3-kilometer search.</description>

Abstract: A miniaturized linearly-polarized patch antenna is presented for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) at 1. 8 GHz. The proposed antenna consists of a patch element and a 3-turn Complementary Spiral Resonator (3-CSR) with antenna dimension of 50 mm x 50 mm. 3-CSR is inserted in the ground plane to reduce the antenna size. This modification also increased the impedance bandwidth from 43 MHz (1.78-1.83 GHz) to 310 MHz (1.69-2.0 GHz) . Moreover, antenna is fabricated and simulated and measured results are in good agreement. Additionally, a rectifier and matching circuits are designed at -10 dBm to realize a rectenna (rectifying antenna) for WPT application. Rectenna efficiency of 53.6 % is achieved at a low input power of -10 dBm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical-type Model Predictive Control and Experimental Evaluation for a Water-Hydraulic Artificial Muscle with Direct Data-Driven Adaptive Model Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision displacement control for water-hydraulic artificial muscles is a challenging issue due to its strong hysteresis characteristics that is hard to be modelled precisely, and many control methods have been proposed. Recently, data-driven control methods have attracted much attention because they do not explicitly use mathematical models, making design much easier. In our previous work, we proposed fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT)-based model predictive control (FMPC), which combines data-driven and model-based methods for the muscle and showed its effectiveness because it can consider input constraints as well. However, the problem in which control performance strongly depends on prior input-output data remains still unsolved. Adaptive FRIT based on directional forgetting has also been proposed; however, it is difficult to achieve the desired transient performance because it cannot consider input constraints and there are no design parameters that directly determine the control performance, such as MPC. In this study, we propose a novel data-driven adaptive model matching-based controller that combines these methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method could significantly improve the control performance and achieve high robustness against inappropriate initial experimental data , while considering the input constraints in the design phase.</description>

      <title>Applying digital twins for the management of information in turnaround event operations in commercial airports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aerospace sector is one of the many sectors in which large amounts of data are generated. Thanks to the evolution of technology, these data can be exploited in several ways to improve the operation and management of industrial processes. However, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to define architectures and data models that allow to manage and homogenise the heterogeneous data collected. In this paper, we present an Airport Digital Twin Reference Conceptualisation's and data model based on FIWARE Generic Enablers and the Next Generation Service Interfaces-Linked Data standard. Concretely, we particularise the Airport Digital Twin to improve the efficiency of flight turnaround events. The architecture proposed is validated in the Aberdeen International Airport with the aim of reducing delays in commercial flights. The implementation includes an application that shows the real state of the airport, combining two-dimensional and three-dimensional virtual reality representations of the stands, and a mobile application that helps ground operators to schedule departure and arrival flights.</description>

      <title>Precision on Demand: Propositional Logic for Event-Trigger Threshold Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel event-trigger threshold (ETT) regulation mechanism based on the quantitative semantics of propositional logic (PL). We exploit the expressiveness of the PL vocabulary to deliver a precise and flexible specification of ETT regulation based on system requirements and properties. Additionally, we present a modified ETT regulation mechanism that provides formal guarantees for satisfaction/violation detection of arbitrary PL properties. To validate our proposed method, we consider a convoy of vehicles in an adaptive cruise control scenario. In this scenario, the PL operators are used to encode safety properties and the ETTs are regulated accordingly, e.g., if our safety metric is high there can be a higher ETT threshold, while a smaller threshold is used when the system is approaching unsafe conditions. Under ideal ETT regulation conditions in this safety scenario, we show that reductions between 41.8 - 96.3% in the number of triggered events is possible compared to using a constant ETT while maintaining similar safety conditions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Station Keeping of Satellites in Areostationary Mars Orbit: A Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continued exploration of Mars will require a greater number of in-space assets to aid interplanetary communications. Future missions to the surface of Mars may be augmented with stationary satellites that remain overhead at all times as a means of sending data back to Earth from fixed antennae on the surface. These areostationary satellites will experience several important disturbances that push and pull the spacecraft off of its desired orbit. Thus, a station-keeping control strategy must be put into place to ensure the satellite remains overhead while minimizing the fuel required to elongate mission lifetime. This paper develops a model predictive control policy for areostationary station keeping that exploits knowledge of non-Keplerian perturbations in order to minimize the required annual station-keeping $\Delta v$. The station-keeping policy is applied to a satellite placed at various longitudes, and simulations are performed for an example mission at a longitude of a potential future crewed landing site. Through careful tuning of the controller constraints, and proper placement of the satellite at stable longitudes, the annual station-keeping $\Delta v$ can be reduced relative to a naive mission design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of bilevel optimization problems tend to suffer from instability under changes to problem data. In the optimistic setting, we construct a lifted, alternative formulation that exhibits desirable stability properties under mild assumptions that neither invoke convexity nor smoothness. The upper- and lower-level problems might involve integer restrictions and disjunctive constraints. In a range of results, we at most invoke pointwise and local calmness for the lower-level problem in a sense that holds broadly. The alternative formulation is computationally attractive with structural properties being brought out and an outer approximation algorithm becoming available.</description>

      <title>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical optimization is ubiquitous in modern applications. However, in practice, we often need to use nonlinear optimization models, for which the existing optimization tools such as Cplex or Gurobi may not be directly applicable and an (error-prone) manual transformation often has to be done. Thus, to address this issue, in this paper we investigate the problem of automatically verifying and synthesizing reductions, the solution of which may allow an automatic linearization of nonlinear models. We show that the synthesis of reductions can be formulated as an $\exists^* \forall^*$ synthesis problem, which can be solved by an SMT solver via the counter-example guided inductive synthesis approach (CEGIS).</description>

      <title>Intelligent Router for LLM Workloads: Improving Performance Through Workload-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) workloads have distinct prefill and decode phases with different compute and memory requirements which should ideally be accounted for when scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM workloads as monolithic jobs without considering the distinct characteristics of the two phases in each workload. This leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased response latency. In this work, we propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router leverages a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads to schedule queries across LLM instances and achieve over 11\% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Drag Sail Module for LEO Satellites: Implementation and Early Testing of AirDragMod (ADM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space debris has become a critical issue, with debris in orbit surpassing active satellites, posing significant risks to space sustainability. Payloads or rocket bodies discarded post-mission in LEO without orbital control are major sources. The IADC guidelines recommend limiting post-mission presence in protected regions to 25 years. The FCC recently introduced stricter regulations, reducing the allowable post-mission stay for LEO satellites to 5 years. These changes necessitate integrating deorbiting systems into satellite designs. However, adding extra fuel and engines for active deorbiting presents challenges due to LEO satellites' mass and volume limitations, especially for large constellations or CubeSats. This often leads to prioritizing mission-critical components over deorbiting systems. Thus, alternative approaches like passive deorbiting techniques or international regulations are explored. Drag sails are a cost-effective passive solution for small and medium-sized LEO satellites. This paper proposes a plug-and-play drag sail module using COTS components for CubeSats and sub-mass satellites. The scalable design is derived from mission requirements and trajectory analysis. The technique includes active control for quicker deorbiting at specific orbital LTAN. Inspired by JAXA's IKAROS mission, the deployment mechanism uses residual angular momentum and follows a standard sequence. A cost analysis estimates the system's breakeven point. A prototype with a 3D-printed deployment system and inverted stepper motor was tested and compared to a numerical model. A tension model for sail extension petals was developed using curve fitting from test data. SIMULINK multibody models are available for simulations. Further experimentation and prototype development are required to assess real-world performance, with a control system identified as crucial.</description>

      <title>Submodular Maximization Approaches for Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a conventional Federated Learning framework, client selection for training typically involves the random sampling of a subset of clients in each iteration. However, this random selection often leads to disparate performance among clients, raising concerns regarding fairness, particularly in applications where equitable outcomes are crucial, such as in medical or financial machine learning tasks. This disparity typically becomes more pronounced with the advent of performance-centric client sampling techniques. This paper introduces two novel methods, namely SUBTRUNC and UNIONFL, designed to address the limitations of random client selection. Both approaches utilize submodular function maximization to achieve more balanced models. By modifying the facility location problem, they aim to mitigate the fairness concerns associated with random selection. SUBTRUNC leverages client loss information to diversify solutions, while UNIONFL relies on historical client selection data to ensure a more equitable performance of the final model. Moreover, these algorithms are accompanied by robust theoretical guarantees regarding convergence under reasonable assumptions. The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across heterogeneous scenarios, revealing significant improvements in fairness as measured by a client dissimilarity metric.</description>

      <title>Informativeness and Trust in Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persuasion policy successfully persuades an agent to pick a particular action only if the information is designed in a manner that convinces the agent that it is in their best interest to pick that action. Thus, it is natural to ask, what makes the agent trust the persuader's suggestion? We study a Bayesian persuasion interaction between a sender and a receiver where the sender has access to private information and the receiver attempts to recover this information from messages sent by the sender. The sender crafts these messages in an attempt to maximize its utility which depends on the source symbol and the symbol recovered by the receiver. Our goal is to characterize the \textit{Stackelberg game value}, and the amount of true information revealed by the sender during persuasion. We find that the SGV is given by the optimal value of a \textit{linear program} on probability distributions constrained by certain \textit{trust constraints}. These constraints encode that any signal in a persuasion strategy must contain more truth than untruth and thus impose a fundamental bound on the extent of obfuscation a sender can perform. We define \textit{informativeness} of the sender as the minimum expected number of symbols truthfully revealed by the sender in any accumulation point of a sequence of $\varepsilon$-equilibrium persuasion strategies, and show that it is given by another linear program. Informativeness is a fundamental bound on the amount of information the sender must reveal to persuade a receiver. Closed form expressions for the SGV and the informativeness are presented for structured utility functions. This work generalizes our previous work where the sender and the receiver were constrained to play only deterministic strategies and a similar notion of informativeness was characterized. Comparisons between the previous and current notions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sensing-aided Near-Field Secure Communications with Mobile Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The additional degree of freedom (DoF) in the distance domain of near-field communication offers new opportunities for physical layer security (PLS) design. However, existing works mainly consider static eavesdroppers, and the related study with mobile eavesdroppers is still in its infancy due to the difficulty in obtaining the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper. To this end, we propose to leverage the sensing capability of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems to assist PLS design. To comprehensively study the dynamic behaviors of the system, we propose a Pareto optimization framework, where a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to simultaneously optimize three key performance metrics: power consumption, number of securely served users, and tracking performance, while guaranteeing the achievable rate of the users with a given leakage rate constraint. A globally optimal design based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) method is proposed to achieve the Pareto optimal solutions. To reduce the computational complexity, we further design a low-complexity algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and reveal the intrinsic trade-offs between the three performance metrics. It is observed that near-field communication offers a favorable beam diffraction effect for PLS, where the energy of the information signal is nulled around the eavesdropper and focused on the users.</description>

      <title>Revisiting time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations with their corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations, neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale linear equations and high dimension have been hot topics in deep learning, machine learning, control,and scientific computing. Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.</description>

      <title>Modular Meshed Ultra-Wideband Aided Inertial Navigation with Robust Anchor Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generic filter-based state estimation framework that supports two state-decoupling strategies based on cross-covariance factorization. These strategies reduce the computational complexity and inherently support true modularity -- a perquisite for handling and processing meshed range measurements among a time-varying set of devices. In order to utilize these measurements in the estimation framework, positions of newly detected stationary devices (anchors) and the pairwise biases between the ranging devices are required. In this work an autonomous calibration procedure for new anchors is presented, that utilizes range measurements from multiple tags as well as already known anchors. To improve the robustness, an outlier rejection method is introduced. After the calibration is performed, the sensor fusion framework obtains initial beliefs of the anchor positions and dictionaries of pairwise biases, in order to fuse range measurements obtained from new anchors tightly-coupled. The effectiveness of the filter and calibration framework has been validated through evaluations on a recorded dataset and real-world experiments.</description>

Abstract: Bio-engineered robots are under rapid development due to their maneuver ability through uneven surfaces. This advancement paves the way for experimenting with versatile electrical system developments with various motors. In this research paper, we present a design, fabrication and analysis of a versatile printed circuit board (PCB) as the main system that allows for the control of twelve stepper motors by stacking low-budget stepper motor controller and widely used micro-controller unit. The primary motivation behind the design is to offer a compact and efficient hardware solution for controlling multiple stepper motors of a quadruped robot while meeting the required power budget. The research focuses on the hardware's architecture, stackable design, power budget planning and a thorough analysis. Additionally, PDN (Power Distribution Network) analysis simulation is done to ensure that the voltage and current density are within the expected parameters. Also, the hardware design deep dives into design for manufacturability (DFM). The ability to stack the controllers on the development board provides insights into the board's components swapping feasibility. The findings from this research make a significant contribution to the advancement of stepper motor control systems of multi-axis applications for bio-inspired robot offering a convenient form factor and a reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Singular Value Decomposition for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the problems of decentralized Singular Value Decomposition (d-SVD) and decentralized Principal Component Analysis (d-PCA) are studied, which are fundamental in various signal processing applications. Two scenarios of d-SVD are considered depending on the availability of the data matrix under consideration. In the first scenario, the matrix of interest is row-wisely available in each local node in the network. In the second scenario, the matrix of interest implicitly forms an outer product generated from two different series of measurements. Combining the lightweight local rational function approximation approach and parallel averaging consensus algorithms, two d-SVD algorithms are proposed to cope with the two aforementioned scenarios. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms with two respective application examples for Extremely Large-scale Antenna Array (ELAA) systems: decentralized sensor localization via low-rank matrix completion and decentralized passive radar detection. Moreover, a non-trivial truncation technique, which employs a representative vector that is orthonormal to the principal signal subspace, is proposed to further reduce the associated communication cost with the d-SVD algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed d-SVD algorithms converge to the centralized solution with reduced communication cost compared to those facilitated with the state-of-the-art decentralized power method.</description>

      <title>Advancing Humanoid Locomotion: Mastering Challenging Terrains with Denoising World Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like skeletal structure, are especially suited for tasks in human-centric environments. However, this structure is accompanied by additional challenges in locomotion controller design, especially in complex real-world environments. As a result, existing humanoid robots are limited to relatively simple terrains, either with model-based control or model-free reinforcement learning. In this work, we introduce Denoising World Model Learning (DWL), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for humanoid locomotion control, which demonstrates the world's first humanoid robot to master real-world challenging terrains such as snowy and inclined land in the wild, up and down stairs, and extremely uneven terrains. All scenarios run the same learned neural network with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, indicating the superior robustness and generalization capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Hypothesis Testing by Two Observers with Asymmetric Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.11612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the binary hypothesis testing problem with two observers. There are two possible states of nature (or hypotheses). Observations collected by the two observers are statistically related to the true state of nature. The knowledge of joint distribution of the observations collected and the true state of nature is unknown to the observers. There are two problems to be solved by the observers: (i) true state of nature is known: find the distribution of the local information collected; (ii) true state of nature is unknown: collaboratively estimate the same using the distributions found by solving the first problem. We present four algorithms, each having two phases where the two problems are solved, with emphasis on the information exchange between the observers and resulting patterns. We prove different properties of the algorithms including the following: the probability spaces constructed as a consequence of solving the first problem are dependent on the information patterns at the observers; (ii) the rate of decay of probability of error of algorithms while solving the second problem is dependent on the information exchange between the observers. We present a numerical example demonstrating the four algorithms.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Reach-Avoid Zero-Sum Games via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Indistinguishable Trajectories of a Nonholonomic Vehicle Subject to Range Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a global constructibility analysis for a vehicle moving on a planar surface. Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Interval Energy-Reserve Co-Optimization with SoC-Dependent Bids from Battery Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of co-optimized energy-reserve market clearing with state-of-charge (SoC) dependent bids from battery storage participants. While SoC-dependent bids capture storage's degradation and opportunity costs, such bids result in a non-convex optimization in the market clearing process. More challenging is the regulation reserve capacity clearing, where the SoC-dependent cost is uncertain as it depends on the unknown regulation trajectories ex-post of the market clearing. Addressing the nonconvexity and uncertainty in a multi-interval co-optimized real-time energy-reserve market, we introduce a simple restriction on the SoC-dependent bids along with a robust optimization formulation, transforming the non-convex market clearing under uncertainty into a standard convex piece-wise linear program and making it possible for large-scale storage integration. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that SoC-dependent bids yield higher profit for storage participants than that from SoC-independent bids. Numerical simulations demonstrate a 28%-150% profit increase of the proposed SoC-dependent bids compared with the SoC-independent counterpart.</description>

      <title>Edge Information Hub: Orchestrating Satellites, UAVs, MEC, Sensing and Communications for 6G Closed-Loop Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of field robots would be used for mission-critical tasks in remote or post-disaster areas. Due to the limited individual abilities, these robots usually require an edge information hub (EIH), with not only communication but also sensing and computing functions. Such EIH could be deployed on a flexibly-dispatched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Different from traditional aerial base stations or mobile edge computing (MEC), the EIH would direct the operations of robots via sensing-communication-computing-control ($\textbf{SC}^3$) closed-loop orchestration. This paper aims to optimize the closed-loop control performance of multiple $\textbf{SC}^3$ loops, with constraints on satellite-backhaul rate, computing capability, and on-board energy. Specifically, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control cost is used to measure the closed-loop utility, and a sum LQR cost minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the splitting of sensor data and allocation of communication and computing resources. We first derive the optimal splitting ratio of sensor data, and then recast the problem to a more tractable form. An iterative algorithm is finally proposed to provide a sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. We also uncover the influence of $\textbf{SC}^3$ parameters on closed-loop controls, highlighting more systematic understanding.</description>

      <title>VLEIBot: A New 45-mg Swimming Microrobot Driven by a Bioinspired Anguilliform Propulsor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the VLEIBot^* (Very Little Eel-Inspired roBot), a 45-mg/23-mm^3 microrobotic swimmer that is propelled by a bioinspired anguilliform propulsor. The propulsor is excited by a single 6-mg high-work-density (HWD) microactuator and undulates periodically due to wave propagation phenomena generated by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) during swimming. The microactuator is composed of a carbon-fiber beam, which functions as a leaf spring, and shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires, which deform cyclically when excited periodically using Joule heating. The VLEIBot can swim at speeds as high as 15.1mm * s^{-1} (0.33 Bl * s^{-1}}) when driven with a heuristically-optimized propulsor. To improve maneuverability, we evolved the VLEIBot design into the 90-mg/47-mm^3 VLEIBot^+, which is driven by two propulsors and fully controllable in the two-dimensional (2D) space. The VLEIBot^+ can swim at speeds as high as 16.1mm * s^{-1} (0.35 Bl * s^{-1}), when driven with heuristically-optimized propulsors, and achieves turning rates as high as 0.28 rad * s^{-1}, when tracking path references. The measured root-mean-square (RMS) values of the tracking errors are as low as 4 mm.</description>

      <title>Activating the Flexibility in Distribution systems via a Unified Quantification Approach Aligned with the Flexibility Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To activate the flexibility of demand-side distributed energy resources (DERs) in power system operations, it is essential to reasonably quantify the costs of providing the flexibility and its value to the system. This paper proposes a unified quantification method aligned with flexibility models to quantify the cost and value of the flexibility from DERs and their aggregators. Compared with traditional power-range-based quantification approaches that are mainly suitable for generators, the proposed method can directly capture the time-dependent characteristics of DERs' individual and aggregated flexibility regions. Based on the quantification method, we further propose an optimization model for distribution system operators (DSOs) to coordinate the DER aggregators for energy arbitrage and ancillary services provision in the transmission network, along with a revenue allocation strategy ensuring a non-profit DSO. Numerical tests on the IEEE distribution system verify the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: While blockchain offers inherent security, trust issues among stakeholders in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications remain unresolved due to a lack of regulatory frameworks and standardization. Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Grid Generator: Synthesizing Large-Scale Power Distribution Grids using Open Street Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, various stakeholders involved in the analysis of electric power distribution grids face difficulties in the data acquisition related to the grid topology and parameters of grid assets. To mitigate the problem and possibly accelerate the accomplishment of grid studies without access to real data, we propose a novel approach for generating synthetic distribution grids (Syngrids) of (almost) arbitrary size replicating the characteristics of real medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. The method enables large-scale testing without incurring the burden of retrieving and pre-processing real-world data. The proposed algorithm exploits the publicly available information of Open Street Map (OSM). By leveraging geospatial data of real buildings and road networks, the approach allows to construct a Syngrid of chosen size with realistic topology and electrical parameters. It is shown that typical power-flow and short-circuit calculations can be performed on Syngrids ensuring convergence. Within the context of validating the effectiveness of the algorithm and the meaningful similarity of the output to real grids, the topological and electrical characteristics of a Syngrid are compared to their real-world counterparts. Finally, an open-source web platform named as Synthetic Grid Generator (SGG) and based on the proposed algorithm can be used by various stakeholders for the creation of synthetic grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04234v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a network of agents that want to cooperatively minimize the sum of local cost functions depending on a common decision variable. We consider the challenging scenario in which objective functions are unknown and agents have only access to local measurements of their local functions. We propose a novel distributed algorithm that combines a recent gradient tracking policy with an extremum-seeking technique to estimate the global descent direction. The joint use of these two techniques results in a distributed optimization scheme that provides arbitrarily accurate solution estimates through the combination of Lyapunov and averaging analysis approaches with consensus theory. We perform numerical simulations in a personalized optimization framework to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

We begin by augmenting the classical definition of the Volterra series so that it is functorial with respect to a base category whose objects are temperate distributions and whose morphisms are certain linear transformations. This motivates the derivation of formulae describing how the outcomes of nonlinear transformations are affected if their input signals are linearly processed--e.g., translated, modulated, sampled, or periodized. We then consider how nonlinear systems, themselves, change, and introduce as a model thereof the notion of morphism of Volterra series, which we exhibit as both a type of lens map and natural transformation. We show how morphisms can be parameterized and used to generate indexed families of Volterra series, which are well-suited to model nonstationary or time-varying nonlinear phenomena. We then describe how Volterra series and their morphisms organize into a category, which we call Volt. We exhibit the operations of sum, product, and series composition of Volterra series as monoidal products on Volt, and identify, for each in turn, its corresponding universal property. In particular, we show that the series composition of Volterra series is associative. We then bridge between our framework and the subject at the heart of audio signal processing: time-frequency analysis. Specifically, we show that a known equivalence, between a class of second-order Volterra series and the bilinear time-frequency distributions, can be extended to one between certain higher-order Volterra series and the so-called polynomial TFDs. We end by outlining potential avenues for future work, including the incorporation of system identification techniques and the potential extension of our theory to the settings of graph and topological audio signal processing.</description>

      <title>Sensing environmental interaction physics to traverse cluttered obstacles</title>

Abstract: When legged robots physically interact with obstacles in applications such as search and rescue through rubble and planetary exploration across Martain rocks, even the most advanced ones struggle because they lack a fundamental framework to model the robot-obstacle physical interaction paralleling artificial potential fields for obstacle avoidance. To remedy this, recent studies established a novel framework - potential energy landscape modeling - that explains and predicts the destabilizing transitions across locomotor modes from the physical interaction between robots and obstacles, and governs a wide range of complex locomotion. However, this framework was confined to the laboratory because we lack methods to obtain the potential energy landscape in unknown environments. Here, we explore the feasibility of introducing this framework to such environments. We showed that a robot can reconstruct the potential energy landscape for unknown obstacles by measuring the obstacle contact forces and resulting torques. To elaborate, we developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing contact forces and torques when propelled against a pair of grass-like obstacles. Despite the forces and torques not being fully conservative, they well-matched the potential energy landscape gradients, and the reconstructed landscape well-matched ground truth. In addition, we found that using normal forces and torques and head oscillation inspired by cockroach observations further improved the estimation of conservative ones. Our study will finally inspire free-running robots to achieve low-effort, "zero-shot" traversing clustered, large obstacles in real-world applications by sampling contact forces and torques and reconstructing the landscape around its neighboring states in real time.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Versatile, Dynamic, and Robust Bipedal Locomotion Control</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to create dynamic locomotion controllers for bipedal robots. Going beyond focusing on a single locomotion skill, we develop a general control solution that can be used for a range of dynamic bipedal skills, from periodic walking and running to aperiodic jumping and standing. Our RL-based controller incorporates a novel dual-history architecture, utilizing both a long-term and short-term input/output (I/O) history of the robot. This control architecture, when trained through the proposed end-to-end RL approach, consistently outperforms other methods across a diverse range of skills in both simulation and the real world. The study also delves into the adaptivity and robustness introduced by the proposed RL system in developing locomotion controllers. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to both time-invariant dynamics shifts and time-variant changes, such as contact events, by effectively using the robot's I/O history. Additionally, we identify task randomization as another key source of robustness, fostering better task generalization and compliance to disturbances. The resulting control policies can be successfully deployed on Cassie, a torque-controlled human-sized bipedal robot. This work pushes the limits of agility for bipedal robots through extensive real-world experiments. We demonstrate a diverse range of locomotion skills, including: robust standing, versatile walking, fast running with a demonstration of a 400-meter dash, and a diverse set of jumping skills, such as standing long jumps and high jumps.</description>

      <title>Modeling pedestrian fundamental diagram based on Directional Statistics</title>

Abstract: Understanding pedestrian dynamics is crucial for appropriately designing pedestrian spaces. The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the relationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space, characterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by the flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows. However, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are applicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the difficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The flow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however, these angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their periodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs that can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying Directional Statistics. First, we develop a novel statistic describing the pedestrian flow type solely from pedestrian trajectory data using Directional Statistics. Then, we formulate a comprehensive pedestrian FD model that can be applied to various flow types by incorporating the proposed statistics into a traditional pedestrian FD model. The proposed model was validated using actual pedestrian trajectory data. The results confirmed that the model effectively represents the essential nature of pedestrian dynamics, such as the capacity reduction due to conflict of crossing flows and the capacity improvement due to the lane formation in bi-directional flows.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention-driven Quality Prediction for Production Process Optimization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the process industry, long-term and efficient optimization of production lines requires real-time monitoring and analysis of operational states to fine-tune production line parameters. However, complexity in operational logic and intricate coupling of production process parameters make it difficult to develop an accurate mathematical model for the entire process, thus hindering the deployment of efficient optimization mechanisms. In view of these difficulties, we propose to deploy a digital twin of the production line by encoding its operational logic in a data-driven approach. By iteratively mapping the real-world data reflecting equipment operation status and product quality indicators in the digital twin, we adopt a quality prediction model for production process based on self-attention-enabled temporal convolutional neural networks. This model enables the data-driven state evolution of the digital twin. The digital twin takes a role of aggregating the information of actual operating conditions and the results of quality-sensitive analysis, which facilitates the optimization of process production with virtual-reality evolution. Leveraging the digital twin as an information-flow carrier, we extract temporal features from key process indicators and establish a production process quality prediction model based on the proposed deep neural network. Our operation experiments on a specific tobacco shredding line demonstrate that the proposed digital twin-based production process optimization method fosters seamless integration between virtual and real production lines. This integration achieves an average operating status prediction accuracy of over 98% and a product quality acceptance rate of over 96%.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>
