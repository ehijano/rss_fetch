      <title>Investigation of particle dynamics and classification mechanism in a spiral jet mill through computational fluid dynamics and discrete element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the outcome of jet-milling based on the knowledge of process parameters and starting material properties is a task still far from being accomplished. Given the technical difficulties in measuring thermodynamics, flow properties and particle statistics directly in the mills, modelling and simulations constitute alternative tools to gain insight in the process physics and many papers have been recently published on the subject. An ideal predictive simulation tool should combine the correct description of non-isothermal, compressible, high Mach number fluid flow, the correct particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions and the correct fracture mechanics of particle upon collisions but it is not currently available. In this paper we present our coupled CFD-DEM simulation results; while comparing them with the recent modelling and experimental works we will review the current understating of the jet-mill physics and particle classification. Subsequently we analyze the missing elements and the bottlenecks currently limiting the simulation technique as well as the possible ways to circumvent them towards a quantitative, predictive simulation of jet-milling.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for data-driven construction of stochastic reduced models with state-dependent memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for the data-driven construction of stochastic reduced models with state-dependent memory for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. The method addresses two key challenges: (\rmnum{1}) accurately modeling heterogeneous non-Markovian effects where the memory function depends on the coarse-grained (CG) variables beyond the standard homogeneous kernel, and (\rmnum{2}) efficiently exploring the phase space to sample both equilibrium and dynamical observables for reduced model construction. Specifically, we employ a consensus-based sampling method to establish a shared sampling strategy that enables simultaneous construction of the free energy function and collection of conditional two-point correlation functions used to learn the state-dependent memory. The reduced dynamics is formulated as an extended Markovian system, where a set of auxiliary variables, interpreted as non-Markovian features, is jointly learned to systematically approximate the memory function using only two-point statistics. The constructed model yields a generalized Langevin-type formulation with an invariant distribution consistent with the full dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a two-dimensional CG model of an alanine dipeptide molecule. Numerical results on the transition dynamics between metastable states show that accurately capturing state-dependent memory is essential for predicting non-equilibrium kinetic properties, whereas the standard generalized Langevin model with a homogeneous kernel exhibits significant discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation by radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15340v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an investigation of second harmonic generation (SHG) resulting from interaction of radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma. Lorentz force and continuity equations have been used to derive the radial and axial current density components. Further, using these densities in the wave equation leads to analytical expressions for the SHG field amplitudes. These amplitudes exhibit periodic oscillations along the propagation axis, characterized by detuning length dependent on plasma density and laser parameters. Radial and axial contributions to SHG are found to be highly enhanced near the beam axis due to the Gaussian beam profile of the laser. The analytical findings are validated using Fourier Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulations. Notably, unlike linearly or circularly polarized beams which require either inhomogeneous or magnetized plasma, radially polarized beams facilitate efficient harmonic generation in homogeneous unmagnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Wakefield generation and electron acceleration via propagation of radially polarized laser pulses in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a study of wakefield generation and electron injection via propagation of radially polarized laser pulses in homogeneous pre-ionized plasma. The analytical study is based on Lorentz force and continuity equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation are used for evaluating the generated longitudinal wakefields. Trapping and acceleration of electrons are examined by injecting a test electron in the generated wakefields. The results are compared with those obtained via linearly polarized laser pulses. The validation of analytical results is performed using the Fourier-Bessel particle-in-cell (FBPIC) simulation code. It is seen that there is a significant enhancement in amplitude of the longitudinal wakefield generated and electron energy gain via radially polarized laser pulses as compared to linearly polarized laser pulse case.</description>

      <title>Random Trajectory Models for Complex Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many models for complex phenomena use a model for strongly-interacting elements on a small scale to generate larger-scale simulations of some aspects of experimental realizations. These models may be agent-based (as in the case of discrete element method models for granular flow) or based on pattern-forming systems of PDEs (as in models for Raleigh-B\`enard convection patterns). Often these models are purely deterministic, producing a single simulation for each set of initial conditions. If observed realizations demonstrate between-realization variability for important aspects of the phenomenon, those aspects can be simulated by adding probabilistic components to the deterministic models to create random trajectory (RT) models.
  The RT model framework provides probabilistic models which can be fit to data and validated, together with a clear perspective on how difficult it can be to establish any kind of validity for a fitted model. It treats models as code with adjustable coefficients, rather than as systems of differential equations. It provides a simply stated necessary condition for these code models to be easily fit and verified, as well as an argument that this condition can almost never be checked. When the necessary condition cannot be checked, the RT model framework identifies the code models as black box models which may have the capacity for emulating the joint distributions of small collections of statistics observed on realizations, but which can only provide very weak evidence for any form of explanation for the emergence of any aspect of the phenomenon. The framework also provides a way to clearly understand why finding a useful code model and scientifically validating it may require many person-years of extra experimentation and statistical analysis undertaken after the first output-producing code model is constructed and contributed.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Anisotropy and Its Influence on Helium Bubble Nucleation, Growth, and Decohesion in Polycrystalline Iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of helium bubbles at grain boundaries (GBs) critically degrades the mechanical integrity of structural materials in nuclear reactors. While GBs act as sinks for radiation-induced defects, their inherent structural anisotropy leads to complex helium bubble evolution behaviors that remain poorly understood. This work integrates accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and a novel atomic-scale metric, the flexibility volume (V_f), to establish the interplay between GB character, helium segregation, and bubble growth mechanisms in body-centered cubic iron. We demonstrate that V_f, which incorporates both local atomic volume and vibrational properties, qualitatively predicts deformation propensity. Our results reveal that the atomic-scale segregation energy landscape dictates initial helium clustering and subsequent bubble morphology, with low-energy channels in tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary facilitating one-dimensional migration while isolated deep traps in twist {\Sigma}13 boundary promote larger, rounder bubble morphology. Critically, besides gradual bubble growth via trap mutation mechanism, we identify two distinct stress-relief mechanisms: loop punching in anisotropic tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary and interfacial decohesion in twist {\Sigma}11 boundary, with the dominant pathway determined by the interplay between bubble morphology and local mechanical softness. This study establishes a fundamental connection between GB crystallographic and energetical anisotropy and helium bubble evolution, providing critical insights for designing radiation-tolerant microstructures.</description>

      <title>Model Order Reduction for Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are indispensable for exploring the behavior of atoms and molecules. Grounded in quantum mechanical principles, quantum molecular dynamics provides high predictive power but its computational cost is dominated by iterative high-fidelity electronic structure calculations. We propose a novel model order reduction approach as an alternative to high-fidelity electronic structure calculation. By learning a low-dimensional representation of the electronic solution manifold within the Kohn-Sham density functional theory framework, our model order reduction approach determines the ground state electronic density by projecting the problem onto a low-dimensional subspace, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive iterative optimization of electronic wavefunctions in the full space. We demonstrate the capability of our method on a water molecule, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations for both molecular geometry and dynamic properties, highlighting the generalizability through carefully designed parametrization and systematic sampling.</description>

      <title>Emergence of continuously varying critical exponents in coupled map lattice as an effect of quenched disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to an absorbing phase in a spatiotemporal system is a well-investigated nonequilibrium dynamic transition. The absorbing phase transitions fall into a few universality classes, defined by the critical exponents observed at the critical point. We present a coupled map lattice (CML) model with quenched disorder in the couplings. In this model, spatial disorders are introduced in the form of asymmetric coupling with a larger coupling ($p$) to a neighbor on the right and a smaller coupling ($1-p$) to the neighbor on the left, for $0 \le p \le0.5$. For $p=0$, the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class. For $p&gt;0$, we observe continuously changing critical exponents at the critical point. The order parameter is the fraction of turbulent sites $m(t)$. %sites that are not in the laminar region. We observe a power-law decay, $m(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, at the critical point $\epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon$ is the diffusive coupling parameter. These exponents change continuously and do not match any known universality class in any limit. This could be related to changes in the eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix as the disorder is introduced.</description>

      <title>Homogenization with Guaranteed Bounds via Primal-Dual Physically Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strength computations: the sample case of Sr II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07684v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017 (GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Physics-Informed Low-Rank Neural Operator (PILNO), a neural operator framework for efficiently approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) on point cloud data. PILNO combines low-rank kernel approximations with an encoder--decoder architecture, enabling fast, continuous one-shot predictions while remaining independent of specific discretizations. The model is trained using a physics-informed penalty framework, ensuring that PDE constraints and boundary conditions are satisfied in both supervised and unsupervised settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness on diverse problems, including function fitting, the Poisson equation, the screened Poisson equation with variable coefficients, and parameterized Darcy flow. The low-rank structure provides computational efficiency in high-dimensional parameter spaces, establishing PILNO as a scalable and flexible surrogate modeling tool for PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Generalisable Generative Model for Multi-Detector Calorimeter Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider, use the Geant4 toolkit to simulate particle-detector interactions with high accuracy. However, these experiments increasingly require larger amounts of simulated data, leading to huge computing cost. Generative machine learning methods could offer much faster calorimeter shower simulations by directly emulating detector responses. In this work, we present CaloDiT-2, a diffusion model which uses transformer blocks. As is the case for other models explored for this task, it can be applied to specific geometries, however its true strength lies in its generalisation capabilities. Our approach allows pre-training on multiple detectors and rapid adaptation to new ones, which we demonstrate on the LEMURS dataset. It reduces the effort required to develop accurate models for novel detectors or detectors which are under development and have geometries that are changed frequently, requiring up to 25x less data and 20x less training time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-trained model to be published that allows adaptation in the context of particle shower simulations, with the model also included in the Geant4 toolkit. We also present results on benchmarks on Dataset-2 from the community-hosted CaloChallenge, showing that our models provide one of the best tradeoffs between accuracy and speed from the published models. Our contributions include a mechanism for the creation of detector-agnostic data representations, architectural modifications suitable for the data modality, a pre-training and adaptation strategy, and publicly released datasets and pre-trained models for broad use.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Network Framework for Lindbladian Spectra and Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.</description>

In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised neural operator for solving partial differential equations</title>

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) provide a new paradigm for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their training depends on costly high-fidelity data from numerical solvers, limiting applications in complex systems. We propose a self-supervised neural operator (SNO) that generates accurate and diverse training data on the fly without numerical solvers. SNO consists of three parts: a physics-informed sampler (PI-sampler) based on Bayesian PINNs for efficient data generation, a function encoder (FE) for compact input-output representations, and an encoder-only Transformer for operator learning, mapping boundary/initial conditions, source terms, and geometries to PDE solutions. We validate SNO on 1D steady/unsteady nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, a 2D nonlinear PDE with varying geometries, and vortex-induced vibration of a flexible cylinder in fluid dynamics. SNO achieves high accuracy in all cases, and lightweight finetuning (O(100) trainable variables) further improves predictions with only a few hundred steps. This work provides a new route toward pretrained foundation models as efficient PDE surrogates.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body approach for near-field radiative heat transfer between nonspherical dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized fluctuational electrodynamics-based many-body approach for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between nonspherical dipoles is proposed. The geometric parameters of nonspherical dipoles are implemented in the definition of the self-term of the free-space Green's function. Dipole polarizability is defined a posteriori from the free-space Green's function solution such that polarizability calculation is an optional post-processing step rather than a required input. Both strong and weak forms of the generalized many-body approach are presented. It is shown that the approximate weak form is less computationally expensive but is only applicable to small particles characterized by size parameters less than ~0.24. The generalized many-body method is compared against an analytical solution for NFRHT between two spheroidal dipoles. A good agreement is obtained, and the small discrepancies are ascribed to differences in approximations for multiple reflections. The generalized many-body method is then applied to analyze the near-field spectral conductance between two SiC ellipsoidal dipoles. Results reveal that changes in the orientation of one of the ellipsoidal dipoles lead to active tuning of localized surface phonon resonance by up to three orders of magnitude. Finally, the spectral radiative thermal conductivity of a metamaterial composed of 1000 SiO2 ellipsoidal particles is studied. The metamaterial displays anisotropic radiative thermal conductivity, with resonance values differing by up to a factor of 2.8 between different directions. The generalized many-body model of NFRHT presented in this paper may be used to develop particle-based metamaterials with novel, engineered radiative thermal properties.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds -- General theory and analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving surfaces is presented. It is based on a general curvilinear surface parameterization that describes the motion of the ALE frame. Its in-plane part becomes fully arbitrary, while its out-of-plane part follows the material motion of the surface. This allows for the description of flows on deforming surfaces using only surface meshes. The unknown fields are the fluid density or pressure, the fluid velocity and the surface motion, where the latter two share the same normal velocity. The corresponding field equations are the continuity equation or area-incompressibility constraint, the surface Navier-Stokes equations, and suitable surface mesh equations. Particularly advantageous are mesh equations based on membrane elasticity. The presentation focuses on the coupled set of strong and weak form equations, and presents several manufactured steady and transient solutions. These solutions are used together with numerical simulations to illustrate and discuss the properties of the proposed new ALE formulation. They also serve as basis for the development and verification of corresponding computational methods. The new formulation allows for a detailed study of fluidic membranes such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the theory and simulation results are presented for 3D vector cylindrical rotationally symmetric electromagnetic wave propagation in an isotropic nonlinear medium using a modified finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method for nonlinear polarization vectors, the nonlinear dipole moment per unit volume, including both an isotropic part and an anisotropic part. The theory is presented for both the transverse magnetic and transverse electric cases along with the combined equations. The simulation results for transverse electric spatial soliton propagation in BK7, and the simulation results for transverse electric and transverse magnetic spatial soliton propagation in fused silica, assuming a purely isotropic polarization vector, are shown. The simulation results for both transverse magnetic and transverse electric spatial soliton propagation in carbon disulfide, including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector, are also shown.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Forward and Inverse Potential-Density Mappings in Classical Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators are capable of capturing nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, offering a data-driven approach to modeling complex functional relationships in classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this work, we evaluate the performance of several neural operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the one-body density profile $\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function $c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with those obtained from the direct mapping $V_{ext} \mapsto \rho$ with neural operators, as well as with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) combined with Active Learning by Error Control (ALEC), which has shown strong performance in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed PointNets for Modeling Electromagnetic Scattering from All-Dielectric Metasurfaces with Inclined Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are innovative planar optical structures capable of manipulating incident light properties. Accurate and computationally efficient modeling of such metasurfaces, particularly those with irregular geometries, remains a challenge for conventional solvers. In this work, we present a mesh-free Physics-Informed PointNet (PIPN) to model electromagnetic scattering from all-dielectric metasurfaces that feature spatially varying nanopillars. Our approach uses the PointNet architecture to directly encode spatially varying material properties into the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) framework. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our PIPN through evaluations on datasets; these datasets are generated with varying refractive indices representing common dielectric materials. Furthermore, the inclination angles are varied within each dataset, which represent expected manufacturing defects. Overall, our method provides a promising, mesh-free framework for accurate and efficient modeling of complex optical structures represented by irregular geometries.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>
