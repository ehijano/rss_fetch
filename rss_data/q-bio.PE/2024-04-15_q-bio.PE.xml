      <title>Interaction networks in persistent Lotka-Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central concern of community ecology is the interdependence between interaction strengths and the underlying structure of the network upon which species interact. In this work we present a solvable example of such a feedback mechanism in a generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamical system. Beginning with a community of species interacting on a network with arbitrary degree distribution, we provide an analytical framework from which properties of the eventual `surviving community' can be derived. We find that highly-connected species are less likely to survive than their poorly connected counterparts, which skews the eventual degree distribution towards a preponderance of species with low degree, a pattern commonly observed in real ecosystems. Further, the average abundance of the neighbours of a species in the surviving community is lower than the community average (reminiscent of the famed friendship paradox). Finally, we show that correlations emerge between the connectivity of a species and its interactions with its neighbours. More precisely, we find that highly-connected species tend to benefit from their neighbours more than their neighbours benefit from them. These correlations are not present in the initial pool of species and are a result of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>SIR-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Policy Control during Epidemiological Outbreaks in Emerging Market and Developing Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the intricate interplay between public health and economic stability on a global scale. This study proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize health and economic outcomes during pandemics. The framework leverages the SIR model, integrating both lockdown measures (via a stringency index) and vaccination strategies to simulate disease dynamics. The stringency index, indicative of the severity of lockdown measures, influences both the spread of the disease and the economic health of a country. Developing nations, which bear a disproportionate economic burden under stringent lockdowns, are the primary focus of our study. By implementing reinforcement learning, we aim to optimize governmental responses and strike a balance between the competing costs associated with public health and economic stability. This approach also enhances transparency in governmental decision-making by establishing a well-defined reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. In essence, this study introduces an innovative and ethical strategy to navigate the challenge of balancing public health and economic stability amidst infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Mind and Culture: Evidence from Visual Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While connections between climate and the human mind and culture are widely acknowledged, they are not thoroughly quantified. Analyzing 100,000 paintings and data on 2,000 artists from the 13th to 21st centuries, the study reveals that the lightness of the paintings exhibited an interesting U-shaped pattern mirroring global temperature trends. There is a significant association between the two, even after controlling for various factors. Event study analysis using the artist-level data further reveals that high-temperature shocks resulted in brighter paintings in later periods for artists who experienced them compared to the control group. The effect is particularly pronounced in art genres that rely on artists' imaginations, indicating a notable influence on artists' minds. These findings underscore the enduring impact of climate on the human mind and culture throughout history and highlight art as a valuable tool for understanding people's minds and cultures.</description>

      <title>Combining Compositional Data Sets Introduces Error in Covariance Network Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microbial communities are diverse biological systems that include taxa from across multiple kingdoms of life. Notably, interactions between bacteria and fungi play a significant role in determining community structure. However, these statistical associations across kingdoms are more difficult to infer than intra-kingdom associations due to the nature of the data involved using standard network inference techniques. We quantify the challenges of cross-kingdom network inference from both a theoretical and practical viewpoint using synthetic and real-world microbiome data. We detail the theoretical issue presented by combining compositional data sets drawn from the same environment, e.g. 16S and ITS sequencing of a single set of samples, and survey common network inference techniques for their ability to handle this error. We then test these techniques for the accuracy and usefulness of their intra- and inter-kingdom associations by inferring networks from a set of simulated samples for which a ground-truth set of associations is known. We show that while two methods mitigate the error of cross-kingdom inference, there is little difference between techniques for key practical applications including identification of strong correlations and identification of possible keystone taxa (i.e. hub nodes in the network). Furthermore, we identify a signature of the error caused transkingdom network inference and demonstrate that it appears in networks constructed using real-world environmental microbiome data.</description>
