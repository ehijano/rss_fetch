      <title>Parameter estimation of gravitational-wave signals with frequency-dependent antenna responses and higher-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement frequency-dependent antenna responses and develop likelihood classes (standard likelihood, multibanded likelihood, and the relative binning (RB) likelihood) capable of handling the same within the framework of \texttt{Bilby}. We validate the approximate likelihoods by comparing them with the exact likelihood for a GW170817-like signal (signal-to-noise ratio ~ 1900) containing higher-order modes of radiation. We use the relative-binning likelihood to perform parameter estimation (PE) for a GW170817-like signal, including Earth-rotation effects, detector-size effects, and higher-order modes. We study the system in several detector networks consisting of a single 40 km Cosmic Explorer, a 20 km CE and a present-generation detector at A+ sensitivity. The PE runs with RB take around a day to complete on a typical cluster.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data: WICKED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value -- more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.</description>

      <title>The Shamrock code: I- Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Shamrock, a performance portable framework developed in C++17 with the SYCL programming standard, tailored for numerical astrophysics on Exascale architectures. The core of Shamrock is an accelerated parallel tree with negligible construction time, whose efficiency is based on binary algebra. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm of the Phantom code is implemented in Shamrock. On-the-fly tree construction circumvents the necessity for extensive data communications. In tests displaying a uniform density with global timesteping with tens of billions of particles, Shamrock completes a single time step in a few seconds using over the thousand of GPUs of a super-computer. This corresponds to processing billions of particles per second, with tens of millions of particles per GPU. The parallel efficiency across the entire cluster is larger than $\sim 90\%$.</description>

      <title>Results from NASA's First Radio Telescope on the Moon: Terrestrial Technosignatures and the Low-Frequency Galactic Background Observed by ROLSES-1 Onboard the Odysseus Lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath instrument (ROLSES- 1) onboard the Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lunar lander represents NASA's first radio telescope on the Moon, and the first United States spacecraft landing on the lunar surface in five decades. Despite a host of challenges, ROLSES-1 managed to collect a small amount of data over fractions of one day during cruise phase and two days on the lunar surface with four monopole stacer antennas that were in a non-ideal deployment. All antennas recorded shortwave radio transmissions breaking through the Earth's ionosphere -- or terrestrial technosignatures -- from spectral and raw waveform data. These technosignatures appear to be modulated by density fluctuations in the Earth's ionosphere and could be used as markers when searching for extraterrestrial intelligence from habitable exoplanets. After data reduction and marshaling a host of statistical and sampling techniques, five minutes of raw waveforms from the least noisy antenna were used to generate covariances constraining both the antenna parameters and the amplitude of the low-frequency isotropic galactic spectrum. ROLSES- 2 and LuSEE-Night, both lunar radio telescopes launching later in the decade, will have significant upgrades from ROLSES-1 and will be set to take unprecedented measurements of the low-frequency sky, lunar surface, and constrain the cosmological 21-cm signal. ROLSES-1 represents a trailblazer for lunar radio telescopes, and many of the statistical tools and data reduction techniques presented in this work will be invaluable for upcoming lunar radio telescope missions.</description>

      <title>GalProTE: Galactic Properties Mapping using Transformer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents GalProTE, a proof-of-concept Machine Learning model utilizing a Transformer Encoder to determine stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation from optical spectra. Designed for large astronomical surveys, GalProTE significantly accelerates processing while maintaining accuracy. Using the E-MILES spectral library, we construct a dataset of 111,936 diverse templates by expanding 636 simple stellar population models with varying extinction, spectral combinations, and noise modifications. This ensures robust training over 4750 to 7100 Angstrom at 2.5 Angstrom resolution. GalProTE employs four parallel attention-based encoders with varying kernel sizes to capture spectral features. On synthetic test data, it achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.27% between input and predicted spectra. Validation on PHANGS-MUSE galaxies NGC4254 and NGC5068 confirms its ability to extract physical parameters efficiently, with residuals averaging -0.02% and 0.28% and standard deviations of 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively. To contextualize these results, we compare GalProTE's age, metallicity, and dust attenuation maps with pPXF, a state-of-the-art spectral fitting tool. While pPXF requires approximately 11 seconds per spectrum, GalProTE processes one in less than 4 milliseconds, offering a 2750 times speedup and consuming 68 times less power per spectrum. The strong agreement between pPXF and GalProTE highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance traditional methods, paving the way for faster, energy-efficient, and scalable analyses of galactic properties in modern surveys.</description>

      <title>Modelling subsonic turbulence with SPH-EXA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with SPH has traditionally been hindered by E0 errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive dissipation. In this work, we present numerical results of SPH simulations of subsonic turbulence and compare to state-of-the-art codes such as AREPO and GIZMO. For the first time, SPH can reproduce the results of such codes, showing a similar interval of wavenumber in the inertial range of the Kolmogorov cascade in the subsonic regime. We use the SPH-EXA code to perform these simulations, a GPU-based state-of-the-art SPH code with high performance and extreme scalability at its core. SPH-EXA is coupled with a modern SPH solver based on methods such as an integral approach to gradient calculation, artificial viscosity switches that include a linear field cleaner, a flexible family of pairing-resistant interpolation kernels, generalized volume elements, and a controlled handling of density jumps which maximizes Lagrangian compatibility. In addition, it includes a novel and extremely scalable gravity solver for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Energy Reconstruction of Non-fiducial Electron-Positron Events in the DAMPE Experiment Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to detecting microlensing events and other transients in light curves, utilising the isolation forest (iForest) algorithm for anomaly detection. Focusing on the Legacy Survey of Space and Time by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we show that an iForest trained on signal-less light curves can efficiently identify microlensing events by different types of dark objects and binaries, as well as variable stars. We further show that the iForest has real-time applicability through a drip-feed analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for LSST alert brokers to efficiently prioritise and classify transient candidates for follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Increasing quantum speed meter sensitivity using optical spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-pass interferometer scheme was proposed in Ref.\,[Light Sci. Appl. {\bf 7}, 11 (2018)] as the method of implementation of the quantum speed meter concept in future laser gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Later it was shown in Ref.\,[Phys. Rev. D {\bf 110}, 062006 (2024)] that it allows to implement the new type of the optical spring that does not require detuning of the interferometer. Here we show that both these regimes can coexist, combining the speed meter type broadband sensitivity gain with the additional lows-frequency minimum in the quantum noise originated from the optical spring. We show that the location of this minimum can be varied without affecting the core optics of the interferometer, allowing to tune the quantum noise shape in real time to follow the ``chirp'' GW signals.</description>

      <title>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>
