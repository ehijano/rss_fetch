      <title>An Integrated Experimental and Modeling Approach for Crystallization of Complex Biotherapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization of proteins, specifically proteins of medical relevance, is performed for various reasons such as to understand the protein structure and to design therapies. Obtaining kinetic constants in rate laws for nucleation and growth of advanced biotherapeutics such as capsids, an assembly of macromolecules, is challenging and essential to the design of the crystallization processes. In this work, coupled population balance and species balance equations are developed to extract nucleation and growth kinetics for crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids. A comparison of model results with that of experimental data for capsid crystallization in hanging-drop vapor diffusion system shows that slow rate of vapor diffusion from the droplet controls the initial nucleation and growth processes, and the capsid nucleation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation in the microdroplet. Results also show that the capsids, which are of very high molecular weight (~3.6 MDa), have a similar tendency to nucleate as small organic molecules such as glycine (75 Da), low-molecular-weight proteins, and small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients due to its ball-shaped outer structure/shape. Capids also show a prolonged nucleation period as for proteins and other macromolecules, but has a slow growth rate with a growth rate pre-factor seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of lysozyme. The capsid crystal growth rate is weakly sensitive to the supersaturation compared to lysozyme and is limited by the transport of capsids due to slow Brownian motion resulting from the very high molecular weight.</description>

      <title>Radiator Tailoring for Enhanced Performance in InAs-Based Near-Field Thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field thermophotovoltaics (NFTPV) systems have significant potential for waste heat recovery applications, with both high theoretical efficiency and power density, up to 40% and $11 \ \mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$ at 900 K. Yet experimental demonstrations have only achieved up to 14% efficiency and modest power densities (i.e., $0.75 \ \mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$). While experiments have recently started to focus on photovoltaic (PV) cells custom-made for NFTPV, most work still relies on conventional doped silicon radiators. In this work, we design an optimized NFTPV radiator for an indium arsenide-based system and, in the process, investigate models for the permittivity of InAs in the context of NFTPV. Based on existing measurements of InAs absorption, we find that the traditional Drude model overestimates free carrier absorption in InAs. We replace the Drude portion of the InAs dielectric function with a revised model derived from ionized impurity scattering. Using this revised model, we maximize the spectral efficiency and power density of a NFTPV system by optimizing the spectral coupling between a radiator and an InAs PV cell. We find that when the radiator and the PV cell are both made of InAs, a nearly threefold improvement of spectral efficiency is possible compared to a traditional silicon radiator with the same InAs cell. This enhancement reduces subgap thermal transfer while maintaining power output.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging with X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging encompasses a broad range of methods that exploit the quantum properties of light to capture information about an object. One such approach involves using a two-photon quantum state, where only one photon interacts with the object being imaged while its entangled partner carries spatial or temporal information. To implement this technique, it is necessary to generate specific quantum states of light and detect photons at the single-photon level. While this method has been successfully demonstrated in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, extending it to X-rays has faced significant challenges due to the difficulties in producing a sufficient rate of X-ray photon pairs and detecting them with adequate resolution. Here, we demonstrate record high rates of correlated X-ray photon pairs produced via a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process and we employ these photons to perform quantum correlation imaging of several objects, including a biological sample (E. cardamomum seedpod). Notably, we report an unprecedented detection rate of about 6,300 pairs per hour and the observation of energy anti-correlation for the X-ray photon pairs. We also present a detailed analysis of the properties of the down-converted X-ray photons, as well as a comprehensive study of the correlation imaging formation, including a study of distortions and corrections. These results mark a substantial advancement in X-ray quantum imaging, expanding the possibilities of X-ray quantum optical technologies, and illustrating the pathway towards enhancing biological imaging with reduced radiation doses.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior of hard sheared cube family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sheared cube is made out of a cube by giving a shear to the body in one direction keeping one of the faces fixed. We investigate here the thermodynamic phase behavior of a family of such regular hard sheared cubes, each of the members of the family having a distinct angle made by the faces with the perpendicular on the fixed face. Hard particle Monte Carlo (HPMC) has been performed with these anisotropic building blocks resulting entropy-driven self assembly. Thereby computational evidence of discrete plastic crystal phase has been found in crystal. The discrete plastic crystal phase is known to form through the spontaneous self-assembly of certain polyhedra. Throughout the entire solid regime particle orientations exhibit strong specific correlations before melting into a liquid, without any evidence of freely rotating plastic crystal at lower density solid. It has been thoroughly observed that geometrical attributes of the shapes don't determine any of the properties that designate this orientational disorder phase reported here. We also find that particle's rotational symmetric axes and one of the rotational symmetric axes of the unit cell of the crystal have a strong relationship in their alignment in space. These results, achieved with shapes having crystallographic point group symmetry, are investigated as being consistent with the phenomenology of discrete plastic crystal phase established in earlier works with hard particles having non-crystallographic point group symmetry.</description>

      <title>PCB Transducer Coil Design for a Low-Noise Magnetic Measurement System in Space Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here a minimum power dissipation coil transducer has been designed to allow in-flight noise characterization of a low-frequency magnetic measurement system. The coil was produced using PCB technology to provide mechanical stability and easy integration close to the magnetic sensors. The transducer design strategy relies on an inverse boundary element method, which has been efficiently adapted to produce optimal multilayer PCB coils subjected to different geometrical and performance constraints. The resulting coil transducer was simulated and experimentally validated under realistic conditions where the payload is magnetically shielded from low-frequency fluctuations by using a three-layer cylindrical mu-metal enclosure. The results show that the specific transducer coil proposed efficiently produces stable magnetic conditions for adequate validation of the magnetic diagnostic system while providing reduced power dissipation and optimal mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Embedded Element Patterns of Reactively Loaded Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing reactively loaded antennas and antenna arrays. The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient, tunable, electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling truly spatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionize modern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.</description>

      <title>Exploring lattice thermal conductivity models via interpretable deep learning to accelerate the discovery of novel materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>
