      <title>Disorder-Induced Damping of Spin Excitations in Cr-Doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial chemical substitution inevitably introduces disorder. In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered dominant. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic structure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting. We propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. These results reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a correlated Hund's metal.</description>

      <title>Discovery of nodal-line superconductivity in chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy, band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by 5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors with a chiral structure.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Gradiently Strained Nb0.5Ti0.5N Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), combining superconductivity with diode-like nonreciprocal current flow, recently emerges as an ideal candidate for zero-dissipation electronic circuits. Such technologically advantageous diodes are achieved by intricate material engineering to disrupt inversion symmetry, which leads to the production challenges as well as a limited pool of viable materials. Here we exploit the gradient interfacial strain to experimentally induce the SDE in Nb0.5Ti0.5N (NTN) films grown on MgO substrates. Additionally, the SDE is tunable with an in-plane magnetic field and can be further enhanced by introducing an interfacial anisotropic pinning potential. Our findings establish interfacial strain gradient as a versatile tool for creating and enhancing tunable SDE.</description>

      <title>Luminescence-Induced Tunable Superconductivity in BSCCO via GaP Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of superconducting properties in high-temperature copper-oxide superconductor B(P)SCCO remains a hot research topic in the field of superconducting materials. Building on previous research, here we introduce GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects, leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity, meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably, this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-level system loss characterization of NbTi superconducting resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications. Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Reentrant superconductivity and superconductor-to-insulator transition in a naturally occurring Josephson junction array tuned by RF power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum (grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting (stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$. Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Three prerequisites for high-temperature superconductivity in t-PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi arcs. Our findings pave the way for the stabilisation and optimisation of high-temperature superconductivity in this topological material.</description>

      <title>Diamagnetic Meissner response of odd-frequency superconducting pairing from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for odd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a diamagnetic Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge modes in number-conserving models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors are believed to host exotic quasiparticle excitations known as Majorana zero-modes, with much of the evidence based on BCS mean-field theory. The direct application of mean-field arguments is tenuous in finite, isolated systems relevant in some experiments. Here, we numerically study fermion number-conserving models with long-range interactions, which under periodic boundary conditions exhibit robust topological and non-topological superconductivity, tuned by the strength of interaction [1]. We find evidence that, on the topological side, Majorana edge modes appear in open chains, manifesting as the vanishing of the energy splitting between odd- and even-parity ground states with increasing system size. Additionally, off-diagonal two-point correlation functions show nonlocal, parity-dependent edge effects consistent with Majorana phenomenology. We develop a correlation-based method revealing the spatial structure of Majorana modes in this fully interacting many-body setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Role of correlations in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates under compressive strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in thin films of the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under compressive strain has generated enormous interest, opening up further opportunities to stabilize superconductivity in this class of materials at ambient pressure. To better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been observed experimentally (-2\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the so-called $\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$ character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\gamma$ pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</description>

      <title>Experimental electronic structure of the mineral superconductor covellite CuS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covellite (CuS) is the first known natural mineral superconductor. Despite its simple chemical formula, covellite exhibits a rich crystal structure at the origin of several remarkable properties. The ionic arrangement in CuS crystals leads to a mixed valence of Cu and a second-order structural transition at 55 K. Despite the abundance of structural studies and theoretical reports on its electronic structure, there are scarce references on its experimental band structure. By means of Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES), we have probed the experimental electronic structure of covellite. We compare our results with the predictions of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the calculations, revealing subtle fingerprints of the structural phase transition, and confirming the quasi-2D nature of the electronic structure of CuS.</description>

      <title>Helical $f$-Wave Superconductivity in Cubic Rashba Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rashba effect--a momentum-dependent spin splitting from broken inversion symmetry--is a crucial component for engineering topological superconductors (TSCs). However, time-reversal invariant TSCs based on conventional linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) are fundamentally restricted to a helical $p$-wave state, hosting only a single Majorana Kramers pair. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the unique triple-winding spin texture of cubic RSOC offers a direct pathway to surpass this limitation. We propose a bilayer model where the synergy of cubic RSOC and an intrinsic odd-parity pairing instability yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Furthermore, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs can yield a hybrid helical $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=4$. Our work establishes higher-order spin-orbit coupling as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, holding immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Time Division Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</description>

      <title>Large Tunable Thermoelectric Effects in Superconducting Spin Valves with Commercially Available Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. However, the reported modifications in thermoelectric power are either minimal, involve superconductors with relatively low critical temperatures (below 1 K), or do not utilize commercially available spintronic materials. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green's function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. The thermoelectric effect is optimized when there is a large spin-dependent electron-hole asymmetry in the superconductor combined with spin-dependent transmission through the interfaces. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines.</description>

      <title>Collective mode spectroscopy in time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconductors show a rich collective mode spectrum. In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\Delta = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\Delta_1/\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helium-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations (treated as an ideal Bose gas under the temperature $1.3K$) and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond the HVBK model. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher counter-flow velocities, where the usual splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-fluid model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are typically not current-conserving. In the mean-field BCS theory, current conservation is only guaranteed if the superconducting order parameter is treated self-consistently. We show that this requirement has significant consequences for the current-phase relation (CPR) in certain regimes, where the current density in the superconducting leads is non-negligible. To this end, we introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of the BdG equations with current conservation for quasi-1D superconductor-normal (metal)-superconductor (SNS) JJs. Our model incorporates a phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads, which is set to match the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard, non-current-conserving approaches by calculating the CPR for SNS JJs while varying lengths and gate voltages controlling the normal metal. We show that current conservation has significant implications for the Josephson harmonics and can weaken or even reverse forward skewness of the CPR.</description>

      <title>In-situ electro-optic sampling of microwave signals under cryogenic conditions and for superconducting applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations present clear evidence for the existence of hole pockets. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos.</description>
