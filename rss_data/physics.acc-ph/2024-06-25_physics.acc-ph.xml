      <title>Neural Networks for ID Gap Orbit Distortion Compensation in PETRA III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undulators are used in storage rings to produce extremely brilliant synchrotron radiation. In the ideal case, a perfectly tuned undulator always has a first and second field integrals equal to zero. But, in practice, field integral changes during gap movements can never be avoided for real-life devices. As they significantly impact the circulating electron beam, there is the need to routinely compensate such effects. Deep Neural Networks can be used to predict the distortion in the closed orbit induced by the undulator gap variations on the circulating electron beam. In this contribution several current state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms were trained on measurements from PETRA~III. The different architecture performances are then compared to identify the best model for the gap-induced distortion compensation.</description>

      <title>A life cycle assessment of the ISIS-II Neutron and Muon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon source is the proposed next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Anticipated to start construction in 2031, the ISIS-II project presents a unique opportunity to incorporate environmental sustainability practices from its inception. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will examine the environmental impacts associated with each of the ISIS-II design options across the stages of the ISIS-II lifecycle, encompassing construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning. This proactive approach will assess all potential areas of environmental impact and seek to identify strategies for minimizing and mitigating negative impacts, wherever feasible. This paper will provide insights into the process and first results of the LCA of the entirety of the ISIS-II project.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Efficiency Microwave Heating Producing Record Highly Charged Xenon Ion Beams with Superconducting ECR Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Quench Risk Increase With Irradiation Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting material enables fusion reactor magnet concepts to operate with current densities that would melt materials with non-zero resistance. The application of superconducting material is considered essential for net-positive power machines. Catastrophic damage can occur when superconductivity is lost and the current generates heat. This scenario is called a quench. Stabilizer material carries the magnet current (typically copper) during a quench and is the focus of this work. Irradiation-induced defects store energy in the Cu crystalline lattice. The release of stored energy in the magnet materials, combined with the associated magnet material property changes, can cause extreme off-normal events in superconducting magnets that worsen with fluence at an increasing rate. Stored energy can be released causing local heating and increasing the risk of a quench. For example, following irradiation at 4.6K and an estimated fluence of 0.45*10^18 n/cm^2, an energy release of 0.023 J/g was measured from Cu when increased in temperature from 10K to 18K, which would have been enough energy to create the same temperature increase spontaneously. Extrapolations of experimental data are used to estimate when spontaneous heating can occur due to the release of energy stored in irradiation-induced defects. Critical fluence values are estimated between 1.74*10^18 n/cm^2 and 2.85*10^19 n/cm^2 for neutron irradiation of Cu at a temperature of 20K. High-temperature ramp rate in-situ cryogenic calorimetry experiments of magnet materials following irradiation would provide more clarity to designers of fusion magnet systems. Due to the increased quench risk with superconducting magnet dose, magnetic confinement reactor designers should consider the frequency of maintenance temperature cycles to maintain an appropriate level of risk during operation.</description>
