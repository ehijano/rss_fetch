      <title>Field Equations in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrected black holes: testing the correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grey-body factors and quasinormal modes are two distinct characteristics of radiation near black holes, each associated with different boundary conditions. Nevertheless, a correspondence exists between them, which we use to calculate the grey-body factors of three recently constructed quantum-corrected black hole models. Our findings demonstrate that the grey-body factors are significantly influenced by the quantum corrections for some of the models under consideration, and the correspondence holds with reasonable accuracy across all three models. We confirm that the grey-body factors are less sensitive to the near-horizon corrections of the spacetime, because the grey-body factors are reproduced via the correspondence using only the fundamental mode and the first overtone.</description>

      <title>Barrow Cosmology and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <title>A Fluid-Membrane Description of the BTZ Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2+1 dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has proved to be a remarkably efficient tool to test ideas about quantum aspects of gravity and holography. Here, we provide a classical fluid-membrane description of this geometry, both in static and rotating versions, that defines a dynamical viscous Newtonian fluid with non-trivial transport coefficients, mimicking the black hole. The membrane paradigm for black holes in four or more dimensions usually yields fluids with a negative bulk viscosity, which is a problem because it yields decreasing total entropy in thermal processes according to Stokes' hypothesis. However, the (rotating) BTZ black hole has a zero bulk viscosity and is amenable to a physically viable fluid membrane description at thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic profile of AdS black holes in Lorentz invariance-violating Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is a topic of significant interest in quantum gravity and in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Recently, new classes of black hole solutions have been proposed, involving vector fields and rank-two antisymmetric tensor fields that acquire nontrivial vacuum expectation values, resulting in the Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity models, respectively. These models exhibit novel geometric structures and differ in notable ways from standard Einstein gravity. In this study, we examine neutral anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes within the context of LIV backgrounds, focusing on their thermodynamic properties through two distinct approaches. The first approach utilizes the free energy landscape framework, revealing substantial modifications to the conventional Hawking-Page phase transition. Specifically, LIV effects can alter the stability regimes of black holes and thermal AdS phases, potentially leading to overlapping thermodynamic regimes that would otherwise remain distinct. The second approach involves thermodynamic Ruppeiner geometry, which provides a window into the microstructure of black holes via a well-defined scalar curvature. In general, LIV effects are negligible for larger black holes, which behave like an ideal gas with no significant interactions among their constituents. However, at shorter length scales, the presence of LIV can induce multiple stable and unstable phase transitions, depending on the specific gravity model and the magnitude of LIV effects considered. While Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond gravity share several similarities, we identify distinctive signatures arising from their underlying physical mechanisms. These differences may provide key observational and theoretical constraints for testing LIV effects in black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Schouten-Codazzi Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new phenomenological second order gravity theory to be denoted as ''Schouten-Codazzi' Gravity'' (SCG), as it is based on Schouten and Codazzi tensors. The theory is related, but is clearly distinct from Cotton Gravity. By assuming as source the energy momentum of General Relativity, we form a second order system with its geometric sector given by the sum of the Schouten tensor and a generic second order symmetric tensor complying with the following properties: (i) it must satisfy the Codazzi differential condition and (ii) it must be concomitant with the invariant characterization based on the algebraic structure of curvature tensors for specific spacetimes or classes of spacetimes. We derive and briefly discuss the properties of SCG solutions for static spherical symmetry (vacuum and perfect fluid), FLRW models and spherical dust fluids. While we do recognize that SCG is ``work in progress'' in an incipient stage that still requires significant theoretical development, we believe that the theory provides valuable guidelines in the search for alternatives to General Relativity</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave and Quantum Graviton Interferometer Arm Detection of Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that while a simple graviton scattering model fails to explain the observed arm displacements, both the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum gravitational energy method successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a slowly varying Newton's constant, consistent with existing bounds, can potentially explain a host of observations pertaining to gravitational effects or phenomena across distances spanning from planetary to the cosmological, relying neither on the existence of Dark Matter or (and) Dark Energy, nor on any expected high proportions of either of them in the Universe. It may also have implications at very short distances or quantum gravity scales.</description>

      <title>Estimating the strength of Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometery by solar system tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on timelike geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on null geodesics. Using precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within $\Theta\leq0.067579~\mathrm{m}^{2}$, which is given by Mercury's orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that $\sqrt{\Theta}$ is on the order of the Planck length. Moreover, the constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Is graviton shot noise detectable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of gravitons in gravitational experiments, including gravitational wave observatories, has been all but ruled out given the weak coupling between the gravitational field and matter. Here we propose an alternative: looking not for the presence but for the absence of graviton shot noise in gravitational wave data. Gravitational wave experiments detect very weak signals that correspond to a surprisingly small number of gravitons even at the relatively low frequencies that characterize signals from gravitational wave events. A detailed calculation, which also yields results that are consistent with the existing literature, demonstrates that graviton shot noise may be present at detectable levels in gravitational wave observations. The absence of elevated noise levels due to graviton shot noise, in turn, would indicate that gravity is not a quantum field theory with a conventional perturbative expansion at low energies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we linearize the field equations in the $f(R)$ theory using the Starobinsky model, $R+R^2/(6m^2)$, and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green's functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in maximally symmetric spaces and semiclassical gravity in Anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical gravity solutions in the Poincar\'e fundamental domain of $(3+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, PAdS$_4$, with a (massive or massless) Klein-Gordon field (with possibly non-trivial curvature coupling) with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary. Some results are explicitly and graphically presented for special values of the mass and curvature coupling (e.g. minimal or conformal coupling). In order to achieve this, we study in some generality how to perform the Hadamard renormalisation procedure for non-linear observables in maximally symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions, with emphasis on the stress-energy tensor. We show that, in this maximally symmetric setting, the Hadamard bi-distribution is invariant under the isometries of the spacetime, and can be seen as a `single-argument' distribution depending only on the geodesic distance, which significantly simplifies the Hadamard recursion relations and renormalisation computations.</description>

      <title>Particle creation and evaporation in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine particle creation and the evaporation process in the context of Kalb-Ramond gravity. Specifically, we build upon two existing solutions from the literature \cite{yang2023static} and \cite{Liu:2024oas}, both addressing a static, spherically symmetric configuration. For this study, we focus on the scenario in which the cosmological constant vanishes. To begin, the corrections to Hawking radiation for bosonic modes are examined by studying the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime. Through the calculation of Bogoliubov coefficients, we identify how the parameter $\ell$, which governs Lorentz symmetry breaking, contributes a correction to the amplitude associated with particle production. Within this approach, the power spectrum and Hawking temperature are derived. Additionally, we obtain expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density by analyzing Hawking radiation from a tunneling viewpoint. A parallel approach is applied to fermionic modes. Finally, we examine black hole evaporation, finding that the black hole lifetime in these cases can be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Gravity and fluid dynamic correspondence on a null hypersurface: inconsistencies and advancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike black hole thermodynamics, the fluid-gravity correspondence of a generic null surface appears to be ``incomplete''; though both approaches point to the emergent nature of gravitation. In the existing formulation of fluid-gravity correspondence of a null surface, we have only the momentum conservation relation in the form of the Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation. The other relations, such as the energy conservation relation, continuity relation, etc., are almost non-existent and are discussed sporadically in literature for stretched horizons. Furthermore, the fluid-gravity correspondence is not formulated from a suitable energy-momentum tensor in the conventional manner. In the paper, we address these issues. By giving the energy conservation relation, we improve the fluid-gravity analogy on a generic null hypersurface. Additionally, by introducing a suitable energy-momentum tensor, which forms the basis of the entire fluid description, we formulate the entire fluid description of the null surface. Moreover, we provide the expression of continuity relation in the context of fluid-gravity correspondence. The entire analysis has been done for a generic null surface, which differs from the existing stretched horizon approach and, thereby, expands the scope of applicability for any arbitrary null surface.</description>

      <title>Toward Gravitational Lensing in Modified Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within modified gravity frameworks, focusing on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and normal branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) models, and we compare these results with those obtained from general relativity (GR). Our results reveal that both modified gravity models consistently enhance key lensing parameters relative to GR, including the Einstein radius, lensing optical depth, and time delays. Notably, we find that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and nDGP models yield significantly larger Einstein radii and higher lensing probabilities, especially at greater redshifts, indicating an increased likelihood of lensing events under modified gravity. Our analysis of time delays further shows that the broader mass distributions in these frameworks lead to pronounced differences in high-mass lens systems, providing potential observational markers of modified gravity. Additionally, we observe amplified magnification factors in wave optics regimes, highlighting the potential for gravitational wave (GW) lensing to differentiate modified gravity effects from GR predictions. Through these findings, we propose modified gravity theories as compelling alternatives to GR in explaining cosmic phenomena, with promising implications for future high-precision gravitational lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Splitting in Degenerate Higher-order Scalar-tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a comprehensive analysis of the formalism governing the gravitational field equations in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories. The propagation of these theories in the vacuum has a maximum of three degrees of freedom and is at most quadratic in the second derivative of the scalar field. We investigate the gravitational field equation for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter content along with its non-conserved equations. Our analysis focuses on the evaluation of structure scalars to assess their behavior under Einstein's modification. We present a realistic mass contribution that sheds light on both geometric mass and total energy budget evaluations for celestial objects. Ultimately, we discuss two viable models restricted as minimal complexity and conformal flatness to enhance the scientific contribution of the present manuscript.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was claimed in Ref.[1] that in the spatially flat cosmological case there exists a unique conserved measure (up to normalization) on the effective phase space $(\phi,\dot{\phi})$ for scalar-field with $m^2\phi^2$ potential through the proof of the existence of a unique solution to the differential equation $(44)$ with a unique physical solution in the low-energy limit. Moreover, in Ref.[2] it was also claimed that a unique physical solution to the same differential equation was found in the high-energy limit. In this comment, we reexamine these claims. We obtain general physical solutions to the equation $(44)$ both in the low-energy and high-energy limit, which include the asymptotic solutions in Ref.[1] and Ref.[2] as special cases. Therefore, we conclude that following the constructions in Ref.[1] there actually exist infinitely many conserved measures for the scalar-field with $m^2\phi^2$ potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of Einstein field equations for static spherically symmetric spacetime metric with anisotropic internal stresses has been obtained. The matter has vanishing complexity and a spacetime metric that satisfies the Karmarkar condition and is conformally flat. It has been noted that there is only one solution that meets these three conditions. This has been shown as a proof of the theorem.</description>

      <title>The effective speed of sound in cosmological perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multi-field/fluid cosmological system consisting of a number of minimally coupled canonical scalar fields, non-canonical scalar fields and barotropic perfect fluids, we introduce a new definition of effective speed of sound of the entire system for describing the evolution of cosmological perturbations. This effective speed of sound is not just gauge invariant but also a background dependent quantity and therefore can be treated as a parameter to quantify perturbations in such multi-field/fluid systems. It is with this effective speed that the gauge invariant Bardeen potential and the curvature perturbation propagate at scales much smaller than the sound horizon. Further, the effective speed of sound defined in this paper generalizes the one defined by Garriga and Mukhanov for a single non-canonical scalar field to a system consisting of many minimally coupled barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Moreover, just like in the case of a single pure-kinetic non-canonical scalar field, this effective speed of the sound of the total system turns out to be identically equal to the total adiabatic speed of sound when the dynamic of the universe is driven by a number of pure kinetic non-canonical scalar fields making such a system tantamount to a system of equivalent multi barotropic perfect fluids. We also derive a set of equations which governs the evolution of perturbations in a general multi-field/fluid universe containing barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Using these equations we show that, in the large scale limit ($k = 0$ scales), if the perturbations are initially adiabatic, then it continues to remain so at that scales throughout the evolution of the universe. Consequently, at that scales, such multi-field/fluid universe dynamically behaves as if it contains only a single barotropic perfect fluid.</description>

      <title>Running Hubble constant: evolutionary Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an evolutionary dark energy model, based on the presence of non-equilibrium effects on the dark energy constituents, which are described via a bulk viscosity contribution. We implement the proposed dynamics by the analysis of the 40-bins Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) Pantheon sample data, in order to outline the existence of a running Hubble constant with the redshift. Via a fitting procedure, we determine the value of the additional parameter that our model possesses with respect a standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. As important result, the evolutionary dark energy proposal seems more appropriate to describe the binned SN analysis with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM Hubble parameter, i.e. a non running value for the Hubble constant over the bins.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Black Holes and Ensemble-averaged Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using the ensemble-averaged theory, we define the thermodynamic free energy of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This approach derives the gravitational partition function by incorporating non-saddle geometries besides the classical solutions. Unlike the sharp transition points seen in free energy calculated via saddle-point approximation, the ensemble-averaged free energy plotted against temperature shows a smoother behavior, suggesting that black hole phase transitions may be viewed as a small $G_N$ (Newton's gravitational constant) limit of the ensemble theory. This is similar to the behavior of black hole solutions in Einstein's gravity theory in AdS spacetime. We have obtained an expression for the quantum-corrected free energy for EGB-AdS black holes, and in the six-dimensional case, we observe a well-defined local minimum after the transition temperature which was absent in the earlier analysis of the classical free energy landscape. Furthermore, we expand the ensemble-averaged free energy in powers of $G_N$ to identify non-classical contributions. Our findings indicate that the similarities in the thermodynamic behavior between five-dimensional EGB-AdS and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes, as well as between six-dimensional EGB-AdS and Schwarzschild-AdS black holes, extend beyond the classical regime.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Quantum Radiation from Round-trip Flying Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erasing a black hole leaves spacetime flat, so light passing through the region before any star forms and after black hole's evaporation shows no time delay, just like a flying mirror that returns to its initial starting point. Quantum radiation from a round-trip flying mirror has not been solved despite the model's mathematical simplicity and physical clarity. Here, we solve the particle creation from worldlines that asymptotically start and stop at the same spot, resulting in interesting spectra and symmetries, including the time dependence of thermal radiance associated with Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac Bogolubov coefficients. Fourier analysis, intrinsically linked to the Bogolubov mechanism, shows that a thermal Bogolubov distribution does not describe the spin statistics of the quantum field.</description>

Abstract: We comment on the fact that certain mathematical models that have been proposed in the quantum gravity literature, may not be subject to experimental checks, even if they turn out to be mathematically well defined. This means that they would be indistinguishable from other models, with a smaller number of quantum states. These considerations follow from very general properties of quantum measurement theory and classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around $10^6\,M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Do we live on the End of the World?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of a de Sitter universe living on an End-of-the-World brane. Motivated by the Swampland programme and in particular the Cobordism Conjecture, we consider a compact region of AdS$_5$ nucleating from nothing, with a dS$_4$ living on its boundary. We show that it can equivalently be interpreted as an up-tunnelling from AdS$_5$ with cosmological constant $\Lambda\to -\infty$, following Brown and Dahlen's proposal for 'nothing'. Their picture naively leads to the conclusion that the brane has infinite negative tension. But we show that it becomes finite and positive once we employ holographic renormalization, recovering the Bubble of Something where the domain wall becomes a boundary of spacetime. The same holds true in any number of dimensions and, moreover, at the level of metric perturbations. This provides motivation for alternative routes of obtaining cosmology from quantum gravity or string theory using domain walls, departing from conventional vacuum approaches.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure anisotropy on quark stars structure in the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic curvature with non-CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic curvature $\Omega_{K}$ is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain $\Omega_{K}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically $\Omega_{K}=0.108\pm0.056$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is in $2.6\sigma$ tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the $\Lambda$CDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of $\Omega_{K}$ is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat $\Lambda$CDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy and cosmological constant in QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological constant term (CC), $\Lambda$, is a pivotal ingredient in the standard model of cosmology or $\Lambda$CDM, but it is a rigid quantity for the entire cosmic history. This is unnatural and inconsistent. Different theoretical and phenomenological conundrums suggest that the $\Lambda$CDM necessitates further theoretical underpinning to cope with modern observations. An interesting approach is the framework of the `running vacuum model' (RVM). It endows $\Lambda$ with cosmic dynamics within a fundamental framework since it is based on QFT. In the RVM, the vacuum energy density (VED) appears as a series of powers of the Hubble function and its derivatives, $\rho_{\rm vac} (H, \dot{H},...)$. In the current universe, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ changes as $\sim H^2$. Higher order effects ${\cal O}(H^4)$, on the other hand, can be responsible for a new mechanism of inflation (RVM-inflation). On the practical side the RVM can alleviate the cosmological tensions on $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. An intriguing smoking gun signature of the RVM is that its equation of state can mimic quintessence, as recently observed by DESI, so the vacuum can be the sought-for dynamical DE. At a deeper theoretical level, the RVM-renormalized form of the VED can avoid extreme fine tuning related to the well-known cosmological constant problem. Overall, the RVM has the capacity to impinge positively on relevant theoretical and practical aspects of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Premerger observation and characterization of massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an end-to-end technique for observing and characterizing massive black hole binary signals before they merge with the LISA space-based gravitational-wave observatory. Our method uses a zero-latency whitening filter, originally designed for rapidly observing compact binary mergers in ground-based observatories, to be able to observe signals with no additional latency due to filter length. We show that with minimal computational cost, we are able to reliably observe signals as early as 14 days premerger as long as the signal has accrued a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 8 in the LISA data. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to characterize the source properties, providing early estimates of the source's merger time, chirp mass, and sky localization. Early observation and characterization of massive black holes is crucial to enable the possibility of rapid multimessenger observations, and to ensure that LISA can enter a protected operating period when the merger signal arrives.</description>

      <title>Inferring jet physics from neutron star - black hole mergers with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers that undergo tidal disruption may launch jets that could power a gamma-ray burst. We use a population of simulated NSBH systems to measure jet parameters from the gravitational waves emitted by these systems. The conditions during the tidal disruption and merger phase required to power a gamma-ray burst are uncertain. It is likely that the system must achieve some minimum remnant baryonic mass after the merger before a jet can be launched to power a gamma-ray burst. Assuming a fiducial neutron star equation of state, we show how Bayesian hierarchical inference can be used to infer the minimum remnant mass required to launch a gamma-ray burst jet as well as the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to detect a gamma-ray burst. We find that with 200 NSBH observations, we can measure the minimum disk mass to within 0.01 solar masses at 90% credibility. We simultaneously infer the maximum gamma-ray burst viewing angle to within 13 degrees at 90% credibility. We conclude that upcoming upgrades to the LIGO observatories may provide important new insights into the physics of NSBH jets.</description>

      <title>Conservation Law and Trace Anomaly for the Stress Energy Tensor of a Self-Interacting Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a self-interacting, massive, real scalar field on a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime and the associated stress-energy tensor. Using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to perturbative quantum field theory, we study the associated, Wick-ordered, quantum observable. In particular we generalize a construction, first developed in the free field theory scenario by Moretti in [Mor03], aimed at exploiting the existing freedoms in the definition of the classical stress-energy tensor, in order to define a quantum counterpart which is divergence free. We prove that this procedure can be adapted also to cubic or quartic self-interactions, at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$ in perturbation theory. As in the free field scenario, the price to pay for ensuring that the quantum stress-energy tensor is divergence free is the emergence of a trace anomaly, which is here computed for a quartic self-interaction.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties, Quasinormal Modes and Greybody factors of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature, photon and shadow radii, quasinormal modes (QNMs), greybody factors, and emission rates of deformed AdS black holes, focusing on the effects of the deformation parameter $ \alpha $ and control parameter $ \beta $. Increasing $ \alpha $ enhances the oscillation frequency and damping rate of gravitational waves, while $ \beta $ shows non-linear behaviour. Electromagnetic perturbations exhibit similar trends, though with lower frequencies and damping rates. Greybody factors are mainly influenced by multipole moment $ l $ and $ \alpha $, with $ \beta $ having a more subtle effect. These findings provide insights into black hole dynamics, mergers, and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>Suppressing data anomalies of gravitational reference sensors with time delay interferometry combinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the LISA and Taiji missions, both transient and continuous data anomalies would pose significant challenges to the detection, estimation, and subsequent scientific interpretation of gravitational wave signals. As is indicated by the experiences of LISA PathFinder and Taiji-1, these anomalies may originate from the disturbances of the gravitational reference sensors due to routine maintenances and unexpected environmental or instrumental issues. To effectively mitigate such anomalies and thereby enhance the robustness and reliability of the scientific outputs, we suggest to employ the ``position noise suppressing'' time delay interferometry channels. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that these time delay interferometry channels can suppress data anomalies by more than 2 orders of magnitude within the sensitive band of 0.1 mHz - 0.05 Hz, while still remaining sensitive to most of the target signals. Compared with existing researches that focus on reconstructing and subtracting data anomalies, our method does not rely on the prior knowledge about the models of anomalies. Furthermore, the potential application scenarios of these channels have also been explored.</description>

      <title>Parity asymmetry of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03928v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is largely understood to be homogeneous and isotropic, the CMB angular power spectra present anomalies that seem to break down parity symmetry at large angular scales. We argue that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra can be parity asymmetric in our new construction of inflationary quantum fluctuations. Our formulation stems from the foundational questions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime in which we impose geometric superselection rules to the vacuum structure for (single-field) inflationary quantum fluctuations based on discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). As a result, we estimate the amplitude of power asymmetry in the scalar and tensor sectors at different scales of $ 10^{-4} {\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. In particular, we predict the parity asymmetry for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and quantify it for different models, like Starobinsky and $\alpha-$attractor single-field inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Search for echoes on the edge of quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at 90\% confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

Abstract: For conformally K\"ahler Riemannian four-manifolds with a Killing field, we present a framework to solve the field equations for generalised gravitational instantons corresponding to conformal self-duality and to cosmological Einstein-Maxwell. After deriving generic identities for the curvature of such manifolds without assuming field equations, we obtain $SU(\infty)$ Toda formulations for the Page-Pope, Plebanski-Demianski, and Chen-Teo classes, we show how to solve the (modified) Toda equation, and we use this to find conformally self-dual and Einstein-Maxwell generalisations of these geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a group field theory (GFT) for quantum gravity coupled to four massless scalar fields, using these matter fields to define a (relational) coordinate system. We exploit symmetries of the GFT action, in particular under shifts in the values of the scalar fields, to derive a set of classically conserved currents, and show that the same conservation laws hold exactly at the quantum level regardless of the choice of state. We propose a natural interpretation of the conserved currents which implies that the matter fields always satisfy the Klein--Gordon equation in GFT. We then observe that in our matter reference frame, the same conserved currents can be used to extract all components of an effective GFT spacetime metric. Finally, we apply this construction to the simple example of a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe, where we derive an effective Friedmann equation directly from this metric. The Friedmann equation displays a bounce and a late-time limit equivalent to general relativity with a single scalar field. Our proposal goes substantially beyond the GFT literature in which only specific geometric quantities such as the total volume or volume perturbations could be defined, opening up the possibility to study more general geometries as emerging from GFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure get strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections become dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these next-generation numerical waveforms be used to observe never-before-seen physics, but they can also be used to test GR and learn new astrophysical information about our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate some extensions of the Kiselev black hole solutions in the context of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$ gravity. By mapping the components of the Kiselev energy-momentum tensor into the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and assuming a particular form of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$, we obtain exact solutions for the field equation in this theory that carries dependence on the coupling constant and on the parameter of the equation of state of the fluid. We show that in this scenario of modified gravity some new structure is added to the geometry of spacetime as compared to the Kiselev black hole. We analyse the energy conditions, mass, horizons and the Hawking temperature considering particular values for the parameter of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass black hole binary parameter estimation with next-generation ground-based detector networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios for the formation and evolution of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the mass range $10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$ remain uncertain, but future ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers will probe the lower end of the IMBH mass range. We study the detectability of IMBH binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks consisting of various combinations of Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometers. We find that, for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2}\sim 1000\,M_\odot$, an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ ($\lesssim 1\%$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2$), and the source redshift can be measured with percent-level accuracy or better at $z\lesssim 2$. The redshift of lighter binaries ($m_{1,2}\lesssim 300\,M_\odot$) can still be measured with $O(10)\%$ accuracy even at $z=10$. Binaries with $z\lesssim 0.5$ can be localized within $1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for $m_{1,2}\lesssim 1000\,M_\odot$, and within $0.1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for comparable mass systems. The sky localization is good enough that it may be possible to cross-correlate GW searches with galaxy catalogs and to search for electromagnetic counterparts to IMBH mergers. We also point out that the low-frequency sensitivity of the detectors is crucial for IMBH detection and parameter estimation. It will be interesting to use our results in conjunction with population synthesis codes to constrain astrophysical IMBH formation models.</description>

      <title>Light rings and causality for nonsingular ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics possess an odd number of light rings and discuss the viability of this model as an effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trapped tubes in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

      <title>Height-function-based 4D reference metrics for hyperboloidal evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperboloidal slices are spacelike slices that reach future null infinity. Their asymptotic behaviour is different from Cauchy slices, which are traditionally used in numerical relativity simulations. This work uses free evolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations in spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this approach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent background spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the height function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal slices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of different choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the reference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics for Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They include 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear Einstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical stability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The results will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions, 3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data, among other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler description, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the G-field, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remains second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in the general relativity community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parametrizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized Komar charges and Smarr formulas for black holes and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral) gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to evade the non-existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Shadows and parameter estimation of rotating quantum corrected black holes and constraints from EHT observation of M87* and Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of quantum gravity (QG) inspired rotating black holes limits the progress of testing QG through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The EHT imaged the supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87*, revealing an angular shadow diameter of $d_{sh} = 48.7 \pm 7 \mu$as with a black hole mass of $M = 4.0_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^6 M\odot$ for Sgr A*. For M87*, with a mass of $M = (6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, the EHT measured an angular diameter of $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu$as. We present rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) spacetimes with an additional QC parameter $\alpha$, and constrain it by EHT observations. For angular shadow diameter ($d_{sh}$) of Sgr A* at $\theta_o = 50^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.443 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.8066 M)$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $0.0 \leq \alpha \leq 1.447 M^2$ and $a \in (0, 0.894 M)$. While for M87* at inclination $\theta_o = 17^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8511 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.6157 M)$ at $\alpha=0.8985 M^2$. For $\theta_o = 90^0$, the bounds are $a \in (0, 0.8262 M)$ at $\alpha=0$ and $a \in (0, 0.9799 M)$ at $\alpha=0.4141 M^2$. These results show that $\alpha$ significantly affects the shadows, offering key constraints on QG models. With EHT constraints from Sgr A* and M87*, RQCBHs and Kerr black holes are indistinguishable in much of the EHT-constrained parameter space, making RQCBHs strong candidates for astrophysical black holes.</description>

Abstract: The relation between the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model and some extensions thereof that incorporate a dynamical time variable is explored. To this end, we rely on the geometric approach to the Hamiltonian dynamics of singular (constrained) systems provided by the Gotay-Nester-Hinds method (GNH). We also use recent results regarding the derivation of the Ashtekar formulation for Euclidean general relativity without using the time gauge. The insights provided by the geometric approach followed in the paper shed light on several issues related to the dynamics of general relativity and the role of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a cosmological model in $ f(Q, C) $ gravity within the framework of symmetric teleparallel geometry. In addition to the non-metricity scalar $Q $, our formulation includes the boundary term $ C $, which accounts for its deviation from the standard Levi-Civita Ricci scalar $ R^* $ in the Lagrangian. We derived the field equations for the metric and affine connection, employed them within a cosmological setting, and a vanishing affine connection to derive modified Friedmann equations. We used the latest observational dataset OHD in the redshift range $ z \in [0, 2.36]$, Pantheon + SH0ES in the redshift range $ z \in (0.01, 2.26)$, BAO, and the joint datasets OHD + Pantheon + SH0ES and OHD + Pantheon + SH0ES + BAO to constrain the parameters of our model by employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to minimize the $\chi^2$ term. Using the constrained free model parameters, we carefully analyzed the behavior of different physical parameters and verified that the model transits from deceleration to acceleration. Finally, we observed that the model demonstrates an expanding quintessence dark energy model and converges to the $ \Lambda $CDM in later times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1801.03658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft hair of black hole has been proposed recently to play an important role in the resolution of the black hole information paradox. Recent work has emphasized that the soft modes cannot affect the black hole S-matrix due to Weinberg soft theorems. However as soft hair is generated by supertranslation of geometry which involves an angular dependent shift of time, it must have nontrivial quantum effects. We consider supertranslation of the Vaidya black hole and construct a non-spherical symmetric dynamical spacetime with soft hair. We show that this spacetime admits a trapping horizon and is a dynamical black hole. We find that Hawking radiation is emitted from the trapped horizon of the dynamical black hole. The Hawking radiation has a spectrum which depends on the soft hair of the black hole and this is consistent with the factorization property of the black hole S-matrix.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of $N$-tuple critical points of uncharged AdS black holes in generalized quasi-topological theories. The criticality is shown to have a geometrical interpretation described by the Maxwell's equal area rule. We present a compact reformulation of the area rule and identify a criterion for the emergence such points. Using this criterion, we construct several multi-critical points with genuine generalized quasi-topological densities, including a quadruple and a quintuple points.</description>

We use Killing spinors to build analogues of momentum eigenstates, finding that, in the spirit of color-kinematics duality, those for the self-dual dyon lift directly to provide states on the self-dual Taub-NUT background if one replaces charge with energy. We discover that they are forced to have faster growth at infinity than in flat space due to the topological non-triviality of these backgrounds. The amplitudes for massless scalars and spinning particles in the $(+\,+)$ and $(+\,-)$ helicity configurations vanish for generic kinematics as a consequence of the integrability of the self-dual sector. The $(-\,-)$ amplitudes are non-vanishing and we compute them exactly in the backgrounds, which are treated non-perturbatively. It is explained how spin is easily introduced via a Newman-Janis imaginary shift along the spin-vector leading directly to the additional well-known exponential factor in the dot product of the spin with the momenta. We also observe a double copy relation between the gluon amplitude on a self-dual dyon and graviton amplitude on a self-dual Taub-NUT space-time.</description>

      <title>One-loop thermal radiation exchange in gravitational wave power spectrum</title>

Abstract: The radiation-dominated universe is a key ingredient of the standard Big Bang cosmology. Radiation comprises numerous quantum elementary particles, and the macroscopic behavior of radiation is described by taking the quantum thermal average of its constituents. While the interactions between individual particles and gravitational waves are often neglected in this context, it raises the question of whether these elementary particles interact with gravitational waves in the framework of quantum field theory. To address this question, this paper aims to explore the quantum mechanical aspects of gravitational waves in a universe dominated by a massless scalar field, whose averaged energy-momentum tensor plays the role of background radiation. We establish the equivalence between the classical Einstein equation and the mean-field approximation of the Heisenberg equation in a local thermal state. Beyond the mean-field approximation, we analyze the quantum corrections to gravitational waves, particularly focusing on the thermal radiation loop corrections. Interestingly, we find the 1-loop correction surpasses the tree-level spectrum of primordial gravitational waves, which is $O(\alpha^2)$ where $\alpha=H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm pl}$ is the ratio of the inflationary Hubble parameter to the Planck mass. Then, to see if this result persists even if we take into account all the higher order loop corrections, the loop expansion is reorganized in the series expansion in $\alpha$. We schematically discuss two-loop diagrams that may give $O(\alpha^2)$ contributions. We leave explicit computations of these diagrams for future studies. Thus, although we cannot claim that the whole loop corrections exceed the tree-level spectrum at the moment, our findings highlight the significance of quantum effects when studying the interaction between radiation and gravitational waves in the cosmological context.</description>

Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear clusterings of Horndeski-inspired dark energy models with fast transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze time-dependent dark energy equations of state through linear and nonlinear structure formation and their quintessence potentials, characterized by fast, recent transitions, inspired by parameter space studies of selected classes of the more general Horndeski models. The influence of dark energy on structures comes from modifications to the background expansion rate and from perturbations as well. In order to compute the structures growth, we employ a generalization of the \emph{spherical collapse} formalism that includes perturbations of fluids with pressure. We numerically solve the equations of motion for the perturbations and the field. Our analysis suggests that a true Heaviside step transition is a good approximation for most of the considered models, since most of the quantities weakly depend on the transition speed. We find that transitions occurring at redshifts $z_{\rm t}\gtrsim 2$ cannot be distinguished from the $\Lambda$CDM model if dark energy is freezing, i.e, the corresponding equation of state tends to $-1$. For fast, recent transitions, the redshift at which the properties of dark energy have the most significant effect is $z=0.6\pm 0.2$. We also find that in the freezing regime, the $\sigma_8$ values can be lowered by about $8\%$, suggesting that those models could relieve the $\sigma_8$-tension. Additionally, freezing models generally predict faster late-time merging rates but a lower number of massive galaxies at $z=0$. Finally, the nonlinear matter power spectrum for smooth dark energy shows a valley centered in $k\approx1\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ which in the clustering case is replaced by a sharp increase for $k\gtrsim 0.2\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and a peak at $k\approx 2\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A truly relativistic gravity mediated entanglement protocol using superpositions of rotational energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental proposals for testing quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) typically involve two interacting masses which are each in a spatial superposition state. Here, we propose instead a QGEM experiment with two particles which are each in a superposition of rotational states, this amounts to a superposition of mass through mass-energy equivalence. In sharp contrast to the typical protocols studied, our proposal is genuinely relativistic. It does not consider a quantum positional degree of freedom but relies on the fact that rotational energy gravitates: the effect we consider disappears in the limit where the speed of light c approaches infinity. Furthermore, this approach would test a feature unique to gravity since it amounts to sourcing a spacetime in superposition due to a superposition of 'charge'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

Abstract: Pulse Profile Modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross-tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the space-time model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.</description>

      <title>Multi-spectral Sirens: Gravitational-wave Cosmology with (Multi-) Sub-populations of Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational-wave (GW) data of the compact binary mergers by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so-called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual subpopulations, and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different subpopulations. In this work we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with subpopulations of GW events, named multi-spectral sirens. The advantage of the multi-spectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens is demonstrated by the simulation with the mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields $H_0=73.3^{+29.9}_{-25.6}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (median and symmetric 68.3\% credible interval), which is about 19\% tighter than the result inferred with the traditional spectral sirens utilizing a PowerLaw+Peak mass function. The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in [10,200] (log-uniform prior in [20,140]) ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ gives $H_0=71.1^{+15.0}_{-7.5}~(70.3^{+12.9}_{-7.1})~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (68.3\% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of $\sim26\%$ (23\%) with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.</description>

      <title>Stringy Forces in the Black Hole Interior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories break down inside large black holes on macroscopic scales when tidal forces are string-sized. If $r_0$ is the horizon radius and $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale, the 4D Schwarzschild interior is strongly curved at $ \big(r_0 \alpha' \big)^{1/3}$. Infalling massless probes that reach this scale stretch and become excited strings. I generalize this picture for a wide class of black hole solutions in string theory. For the black hole dual to the large-$N$ BFSS model in a thermal state, and denoting $\ell_P$ the Planck length, tidal forces are stringy at $r_0 \left(\frac{r_0}{N^{1/3} \ell_P}\right)^{3/11}$, which is greater than the scale where string perturbation theory breaks down for sufficiently large $r_0/\ell_P$. For 4D Kerr, there is a range of spin parameters for which the inner horizon is to the future of the scale of stringy curvature. These results specify the portion of black hole interior solutions where effective field theory can be used; beyond these scales, one must resort to other methods.</description>

Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression of Redshift-Space Distortion Data for Late-Time Modified Gravity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological observations allow for deviations from the standard growth of large-scale structures in the universe. These deviations could indicate modifications to General Relativity on cosmological scales or suggest the dynamical nature of dark energy. It is important to characterize these departures in a model-independent manner to understand their significance objectively and explore their fundamental causes more generically across a wider spectrum of theories and models. In this paper, we compress the information from redshift-space distortion data into 2-3 parameters $\mu_i$, which control the ratio between the effective gravitational coupling in Poisson's equation and Newton's constant in several redshift bins in the late universe. We test the efficiency of this compression using mock final-year data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and considering three different models within the class of effective field theories of dark energy. The constraints on the parameters of these models, obtained from both the direct fit to the data and the projection of the compressed parameters onto the parameters of the models, are fully consistent, demonstrating the method's good performance. Then, we apply it to current data and find hints of a suppressed matter growth in the universe at $\sim 2.7\sigma$ C.L., in full accordance with previous works in the literature. Finally, we perform a forecast with DESI data and show that the uncertainties on the parameters $\mu_1$ at $z&lt;1$ and $\mu_2$ at $1&lt;z&lt;3$ are expected to decrease by approximately $40\%$ and $20\%$, respectively, compared to those obtained with current data. Additionally, we project these forecasted constraints onto the parameters of the aforesaid models.</description>

Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) for the AdS dyonic black hole carrying the central charge $C$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, neglecting the pressure and conjugate volume along with comparison of different entropy models namely the Bekenstein-Hawking and the R\'enyi entropy model. Inclusion of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$ gives rise to a richer phase structure of the study of thermodynamics by adding a non-equilibrium transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable black hole on top of the Van der Waals transition in the $T-S$ processes and a Hawking-Page transition in the $F-T$ plots. We study an extra mixed ensemble ($\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ due to the inclusion of $\tilde{Q}_m$ where we see Van der Waals phase transition and whose plots change as the entropy model changes though the style of transition remains the same. We observe an interesting phenomenon where changing the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$, the $T-S$ process changes the same way as when varying the central charge $C$ underlining some similarity that is not seen in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy model. We observe a similarity between the plots when both charges are turned off relating to the Schwarzschild black hole and the grand-canonical ensemble. One can observe that as the entropy models are changed, the homogeneity is not lost where the mass as a function of extensive variables is of order one and the rest zero. Finally, we see a similarity in the $\mu-C$ process across the entropy models signally some universality across entropy models as well as different types of black holes studied before.</description>

Abstract: Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical walls. These facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z &gt; 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.</description>
