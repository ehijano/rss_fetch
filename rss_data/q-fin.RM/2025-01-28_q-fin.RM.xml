      <title>Phase transitions in debt recycling</title>

Abstract: Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>
