      <title>Shifting Narratives: A Longitudinal Analysis of Media Trends and Public Attitudes on Homelessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21794v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the field of media framing, homelessness has been a historically under-researched topic. Framing theory states that the media's method of presenting information plays a pivotal role in controlling public sentiment toward a topic. The sentiment held towards homeless individuals influences their ability to access jobs, housing, and resources as a result of discrimination. This study analyzes the topic and sentiment trends in related media articles to validate framing theory within the scope of homelessness. It correlates these shifts in media reporting with public sentiment. We examine state-level trends in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, and New York from 2015 to 2023. We utilize the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database to gather article data and use X to measure public sentiment towards homeless individuals. Additionally, to identify if there is a correlation between media reporting and public policy, we examine the media's impact on state-level legislation. Our research uses Granger-causality tests and vector autoregressive (VAR) models to establish a correlation between media framing and public sentiment. We also use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GPT-3.5 (LLM-as-annotator paradigm) for topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between media framing and public sentiment, especially in states with high homelessness rates. We found no significant correlation between media framing and legislation, suggesting a possible disconnect between public opinion and policy-making. These findings reveal the broader impact of the media's framing decisions and delineate its ability to affect society.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the increasing demands in computer programming education and the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLMs play a critical role in programming education. This study provides a systematic review of selected empirical studies on LLMs in computer programming education, published from 2023 to March 2024. The data for this review were collected from Web of Science (SCI/SSCI), SCOPUS, and EBSCOhost databases, as well as three conference proceedings specialized in computer programming education. In total, 42 studies met the selection criteria and were reviewed using methods, including bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, and structural topic modeling. This study offers an overview of the current state of LLMs in computer programming education research. It outlines LLMs' applications, benefits, limitations, concerns, and implications for future research and practices, establishing connections between LLMs and their practical use in computer programming education. This review also provides examples and valuable insights for instructional designers, instructors, and learners. Additionally, a conceptual framework is proposed to guide education practitioners in integrating LLMs into computer programming education. This study suggests future research directions from various perspectives, emphasizing the need to expand research methods and topics in computer programming education as LLMs evolve. Additionally, future research in the field should incorporate collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary efforts on a large scale, focusing on longitudinal research and development initiatives.</description>

      <title>Exploring the change in scientific readability following the release of ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely influence of AI on scientific writing.</description>

      <title>Hitchhiking Rides Dataset: Two decades of crowd-sourced records on stochastic traveling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Public Service Algorithm: towards a transparent, explainable, and scalable content curation for news content based on editorial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22270v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation challenges traditional, unscalable editorial processes and existing automated systems that prioritize engagement over public service values. To address this, we introduce the Public Service Algorithm (PSA), a novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable, transparent content curation based on Public Service Media (PSM) inspired values. Utilizing a large multilingual news dataset from the 'A European Perspective' project, our experiment directly compared article ratings from a panel of experienced editors from various European PSMs, with those from several LLMs, focusing on four criteria: diversity, in-depth analysis, forward-looking, and cross-border relevance. Utilizing criterion-specific prompts, our results indicate a promising alignment between human editorial judgment and LLM assessments, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate value-driven curation at scale without sacrificing transparency. This research constitutes a first step towards a scalable framework for the automatic curation of trustworthy news content.</description>

      <title>From General Reasoning to Domain Expertise: Uncovering the Limits of Generalization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning. This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in Small LLMs and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing Automated Essay Scoring: A Human-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches, identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability, considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and trustworthy AES methods.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience. Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics and norms.</description>

      <title>TIM: A Large-Scale Dataset and large Timeline Intelligence Model for Open-domain Timeline Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000 annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.</description>

      <title>How Large Language Models play humans in online conversations: a simulated study of the 2016 US politics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.</description>

      <title>Consumer Beware! Exploring Data Brokers' CCPA Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data brokers collect and sell the personal information of millions of individuals, often without their knowledge or consent. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants consumers the legal right to request access to, or deletion of, their data. To facilitate these requests, California maintains an official registry of data brokers. However, the extent to which these entities comply with the law is unclear.
  This paper presents the first large-scale, systematic study of CCPA compliance of all 543 officially registered data brokers. Data access requests were manually submitted to each broker, followed by in-depth analyses of their responses (or lack thereof). Above 40% failed to respond at all, in an apparent violation of the CCPA. Data brokers that responded requested personal information as part of their identity verification process, including details they had not previously collected. Paradoxically, this means that exercising one's privacy rights under CCPA introduces new privacy risks.
  Our findings reveal rampant non-compliance and lack of standardization of the data access request process. These issues highlight an urgent need for stronger enforcement, clearer guidelines, and standardized, periodic compliance checks to enhance consumers' privacy protections and improve data broker accountability.</description>

      <title>Involvement drives complexity of language in online debates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics: COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes, including variations in language complexity between individuals and organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores. Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social structures in online spaces.</description>

      <title>A Decade of News Forum Interactions: Threaded Conversations, Signed Votes, and Topical Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large-scale, longitudinal dataset capturing user activity on the online platform of DerStandard, a major Austrian newspaper. The dataset spans ten years (2013-2022) and includes over 75 million user comments, more than 400 million votes, and detailed metadata on articles and user interactions. It provides structured conversation threads, explicit up- and downvotes of user comments and editorial topic labels, enabling rich analyses of online discourse while preserving user privacy. To ensure this privacy, all persistent identifiers are anonymized using salted hash functions, and the raw comment texts are not publicly shared. Instead, we release pre-computed vector representations derived from a state-of-the-art embedding model. The dataset supports research on discussion dynamics, network structures, and semantic analyses in the mid-resourced language German, offering a reusable resource across computational social science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Adapting University Policies for Generative AI: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Solutions in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools - especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand, their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly 47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions. Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms, and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and equity.</description>

      <title>Agent-based modeling and the sociology of money: some suggestions for refining monetary theory using social simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The institution of money can be seen as a foundational social mechanism, enabling communities to quantify collectively regulate economic processes. Money can be said, indeed, to constitute the micro-macro link in economics. This paper reviews influential views on the nature of money in economics and sociology, contrasting them to the relatively limited findings of recent agent-based models of "the emergence of money". Noting ample room for novel combinations of sociological and formal methods to drive insight into the many roles played by money in the economy, we conclude by indicating research directions in which we believe this combination can provide new answers to old questions in monetary theory</description>

      <title>Under the Hood of BlotchyQuasar: DLL-Based RAT Campaigns Against Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sophisticated malspam campaign was recently uncovered targeting Latin American countries, with a particular focus on Brazil. This operation utilizes a highly deceptive phishing email to trick users into executing a malicious MSI file, initiating a multi-stage infection. The core of the attack leverages DLL side-loading, where a legitimate executable from Valve Corporation is used to load a trojanized DLL, thereby bypassing standard security defenses.
  Once active, the malware, a variant of QuasarRAT known as BlotchyQuasar, is capable of a wide range of malicious activities. It is designed to steal sensitive browser-stored credentials and banking information, the latter through fake login windows mimicking well-known Brazilian banks. The threat establishes persistence by modifying the Windows registry , captures user keystrokes through keylogging , and exfiltrates stolen data to a Command-and-Control (C2) server using encrypted payloads. Despite its advanced capabilities, the malware code exhibits signs of rushed development, with inefficiencies and poor error handling that suggest the threat actors prioritized rapid deployment over meticulous design. Nonetheless, the campaign extensive reach and sophisticated mechanisms pose a serious and immediate threat to the targeted regions, underscoring the need for robust cybersecurity defenses.</description>

      <title>Fairness and Bias in Algorithmic Hiring: a Multidisciplinary Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employers are adopting algorithmic hiring technology throughout the recruitment pipeline. Algorithmic fairness is especially applicable in this domain due to its high stakes and structural inequalities. Unfortunately, most work in this space provides partial treatment, often constrained by two competing narratives, optimistically focused on replacing biased recruiter decisions or pessimistically pointing to the automation of discrimination. Whether, and more importantly what types of, algorithmic hiring can be less biased and more beneficial to society than low-tech alternatives currently remains unanswered, to the detriment of trustworthiness. This multidisciplinary survey caters to practitioners and researchers with a balanced and integrated coverage of systems, biases, measures, mitigation strategies, datasets, and legal aspects of algorithmic hiring and fairness. Our work supports a contextualized understanding and governance of this technology by highlighting current opportunities and limitations, providing recommendations for future work to ensure shared benefits for all stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted through a 45-day follow-up relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.</description>

      <title>When Servers Meet Species: A Fab-to-Grave Lens on Computing's Biodiversity Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity impacts. Our evaluation highlights the need to consider biodiversity alongside carbon and water in sustainable computing design and optimization.

      <title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.</description>

      <title>The AI Imperative: Scaling High-Quality Peer Review in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML), is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality, consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer review.</description>

      <title>A Principled Approach to Randomized Selection under Uncertainty: Applications to Peer Review and Grant Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items; examples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and investment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or deliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the items deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and uncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such deterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving explicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in practice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we prove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval estimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient Randomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the worst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty represented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max intervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an interpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method scales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic properties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically compare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate that MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility under fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while outperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case formulation.</description>
