      <title>AIGC-Assisted Digital Watermark Services in Low-Earth Orbit Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a crucial component of future 6G communication networks, contributing to the development of an integrated satellite-terrestrial network. In the forthcoming satellite-to-ground network, the idle computational resources of LEO satellites can serve as edge servers, delivering intelligent task computation services to ground users. Existing research on satellite-to-ground computation primarily focuses on designing efficient task scheduling algorithms to provide straightforward computation services to ground users. This study aims to integrate satellite edge networks with Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) technology to offer personalized AIGC services to ground users, such as customized digital watermarking services. Firstly, we propose a satellite-to-ground edge network architecture, enabling bidirectional communication between visible LEO satellites and ground users. Each LEO satellite is equipped with intelligent algorithms supporting various AIGC-assisted digital watermarking technologies with different precision levels. Secondly, considering metrics like satellite visibility, satellite-to-ground communication stability, digital watermark quality, satellite-to-ground communication time, digital watermarking time, and ground user energy consumption, we construct an AIGC-assisted digital watermarking model based on the satellite-to-ground edge network. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based task scheduling algorithm to obtain an optimal strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively meets the watermark generation needs of ground users, achieving a well-balanced trade-off between generation time and user energy consumption. We anticipate that this work will provide an effective solution for the intelligent services in satellite-to-ground edge networks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Partial Computation offloading in In-networking Computing-Assisted MEC: A Digital Twin Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of minimizing latency with partial computation offloading within Industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems in in-network computing (COIN)-assisted Multiaccess Edge Computing (C-MEC) via ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) links. We propose a digital twin (DT) scheme for a multiuser scenario, allowing collaborative partial task offloading from user equipment (UE) to COIN-aided nodes or MEC. Specifically, we formulate the problem as joint task offloading decision, ratio and resource allocation. We employ game theory to create a low-complexity distributed offloading scheme in which the task offloading decision problem is modelled as an exact potential game. Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is utilized within the game to proactively predict optimal offloading ratio and resource allocation. This approach optimizes resource allocation across the whole system and enhances the robustness of the computing framework, ensuring efficient execution of computation-intensive services. Additionally, it addresses centralized approaches and UE resource contention issues, thus ensuring faster and more reliable communication.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach combining computer networks and artificial neural networks to construct an intelligent network operator, functioning as an AI model. State information from computer networks is transformed into embedded vectors, enabling the operator to efficiently recognize different pieces of information and accurately output appropriate operations for the computer network at each step. The operator has undergone comprehensive testing, achieving a 100% accuracy rate, thus eliminating operational risks. Furthermore, a novel algorithm is proposed to emphasize crucial training losses, aiming to enhance the efficiency of operator training. Additionally, a simple computer network simulator is created and encapsulated into training and testing environment components, enabling automation of the data collection, training, and testing processes. This abstract outlines the core contributions of the paper while highlighting the innovative methodology employed in the development and validation of the AI-based network operator.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Party Multi-Network AI for Global Deployment of 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple visions of 6G networks elicit Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a central, native element. When 6G systems are deployed at a large scale, end-to-end AI-based solutions will necessarily have to encompass both the radio and the fiber-optical domain. This paper introduces the Decentralized Multi-Party, Multi-Network AI (DMMAI) framework for integrating AI into 6G networks deployed at scale. DMMAI harmonizes AI-driven controls across diverse network platforms and thus facilitates networks that autonomously configure, monitor, and repair themselves. This is particularly crucial at the network edge, where advanced applications meet heightened functionality and security demands. The radio/optical integration is vital due to the current compartmentalization of AI research within these domains, which lacks a comprehensive understanding of their interaction. Our approach explores multi-network orchestration and AI control integration, filling a critical gap in standardized frameworks for AI-driven coordination in 6G networks. The DMMAI framework is a step towards a global standard for AI in 6G, aiming to establish reference use cases, data and model management methods, and benchmarking platforms for future AI/ML solutions.</description>

      <title>High Spectral-Efficiency, Ultra-low MIMO SDM Transmission over a Field-Deployed Multi-Core OAM Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-mode multi-core fiber (FM-MCF) based Space-Division Multiplexing (SDM) systems possess the potential to maximize the number of multiplexed spatial channels per fiber by harnessing both the space (fiber cores) and mode (optical mode per core) dimensions. However, to date, no SDM transmissions over field-deployed FM-MCFs in realistic outdoor settings have been reported, which contrasts with SDM schemes demonstrated using single-mode multi-core fibers (SM-MCFs) installed in practical fiber cable ducts. In this paper, we present the successful demonstration of bidirectional SDM transmission over a 5-km field-deployed seven ring-core fiber (7-RCF) with a cladding diameter of 178 ${\mu}$m, achieving a Spectral Efficiency (SE) of 2$\times$201.6 bit/s/Hz. This work establishes a new record for the highest SE attained in SDM demonstrations utilizing field-deployed fiber cables, achieving an approximate 10x increase compared to the SE of reported field-deployed optical fiber cable transmission systems. Notably, these results are realized through the utilization of small-scale modular 4$\times$4 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing with a time-domain equalization (TDE) tap number not exceeding 15, maintaining a complexity per unit capacity comparable to that of MIMO equalization in SDM demonstrations employing weakly coupled SM-MCF cables. These results underscore the significant potential for achieving heightened SE and expanding capacity per individual fiber using SDM techniques in practical applications.</description>

      <title>SONIC: Connect the Unconnected via FM Radio &amp; SMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of 2022, about 2.78 billion people in developing countries do not have access to the Internet. Lack of Internet access hinders economic growth, educational opportunities, and access to information and services. Recent initiatives to ``connect the unconnected'' have either failed (project Loon and Aquila) or are characterized by exorbitant costs (Starlink and similar), which are unsustainable for users in developing regions. This paper proposes SONIC, a novel connectivity solution that repurposes a widespread communication infrastructure (AM/FM radio) to deliver access to pre-rendered webpages. Our rationale is threefold: 1) the radio network is widely accessible -- currently reaching 70% of the world -- even in developing countries, 2) unused frequencies are highly available, 3) while data over sound can be slow, when combined with the radio network, it takes advantage of its broadcast nature, efficiently reaching a large number of users. We have designed and built a proof of concept of SONIC which shows encouraging initial results.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Uplink and Downlink Transmissions in Wirelessly Powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scheduling uplinks and downlinks transmissions in an Internet of Things (IoT) network that uses a mode-based time structure and Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). Further, devices employ power splitting to harvest energy and receive data simultaneously from a Hybrid Access Point (HAP). To this end, this paper outlines a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that can be employed by a HAP to optimize the following quantities over a given time horizon: (i) mode (downlink or uplink) of time slots, (ii) transmit power of each packet, (iii) power splitting ratio of devices, and (iv) decoding order in uplink slots. The MILP yields the optimal number of packet transmissions over a given planning horizon given non-causal channel state information. We also present a learning based approach to determine the mode of each time slot using causal channel state information. The results show that the learning based approach achieves 90% of the optimal number of packet transmissions, and the HAP receives 25% more packets as compared to competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Securing Distributed Network Digital Twin Systems Against Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of 5G and beyond, the increasing complexity of wireless networks necessitates innovative frameworks for efficient management and deployment. Digital twins (DTs), embodying real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, stand out as a promising solution in this context. Within a time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital counterparts, encapsulated by integrated vertical and horizontal twinning phases, this study investigates the security challenges in distributed network DT systems, which potentially undermine the reliability of subsequent network applications such as wireless traffic forecasting. Specifically, we consider a minimal-knowledge scenario for all attackers, in that they do not have access to network data and other specialized knowledge, yet can interact with previous iterations of server-level models. In this context, we spotlight a novel fake traffic injection attack designed to compromise a distributed network DT system for wireless traffic prediction. In response, we then propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), to counteract various model poisoning threats. GLID strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a particular percentile range, thereby fortifying the security of network twinning process. Through extensive experiments on real-world wireless traffic datasets, our experimental evaluations show that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines, highlighting the importance of security measures in the design and implementation of DTs for 5G and beyond network systems.</description>

      <title>Saving Private WAN: Using Internet Paths to Offload WAN Traffic in Conferencing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale video conferencing services incur significant network cost while serving surging global demands. Our work systematically explores the opportunity to offload a fraction of this traffic to the Internet, a cheaper routing option offered already by cloud providers, from WAN without drop in application performance. First, with a large-scale latency measurement study with 3.5 million data points per day spanning 241K source cities and 21 data centers across the globe, we demonstrate that Internet paths perform comparable to or better than the private WAN for parts of the world (e.g., Europe and North America). Next, we present Titan, a live (12+ months) production system that carefully moves a fraction of the conferencing traffic to the Internet using the above observation. Finally, we propose Titan-Next, a research prototype that jointly assigns the conferencing server and routing option (Internet or WAN) for individual calls. With 5 weeks of production data, we show Titan-Next reduces the sum of peak bandwidth on WAN links that defines the operational network cost by up to 61% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will open-source parts of the measurement data.</description>

      <title>Non-Terrestrial Networks for 6G: Integrated, Intelligent and Ubiquitous Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal connectivity has been part of past and current generations of wireless systems, but as we approach 6G, the subject of social responsibility is being built as a core component. Given the advent of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), reaching these goals will be much closer to realization than ever before. Owing to the benefits of NTN, the integration NTN and Terrestrial Networks (TN) is still infancy, where the past, the current and the future releases in the 3$^{\text{rd}}$ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provide guidelines to adopt a successfully co-existence/integration of TN and NTN. Therefore, in this article, we have illustrated through 3GPP guidelines, on how NTN and TN can effectively be integrated. Moreover, the role of beamforming and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms is highlighted to achieve this integration. Finally the usefulness of integrating NTN and TN is validated through experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Strategic Demand-Planning in Wireless Networks: Can Generative-AI Save Spectrum and Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communications advance hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence (AI), indicating an interconnected advancement where each facilitates and benefits from the other. This synergy is particularly evident in the development of the sixth-generation technology standard for mobile networks (6G), envisioned to be AI-native. Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology capable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and videos, offers significant potential for wireless communications, with its distinctive features. Traditionally, conventional AI techniques have been employed for predictions, classifications, and optimization, while GenAI has more to offer. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning through demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly, GenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless networks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content of various kind (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as from a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless networks in various usage scenarios such as cell-switching, user association and load balancing, interference management, and disaster scenarios management. Therefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless networks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms like large-language-models and the development of more powerful hardware built exclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of demand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes increasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on devices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even more straightforward and feasible.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Comparison of Full-Fledged 5G Standalone Experimental TDD Testbeds in Single &amp; Multi-UE Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source software and Commercial Off-The-Shelf hardware are finally paving their way into the 5G world, resulting in a proliferation of experimental 5G testbeds. Surprisingly, very few studies have been published on the comparative analysis of testbeds with different hardware and software elements.
  In this paper, we first introduce a precise nomenclature to characterize a 5G-standalone single-cell testbed based on its constituent elements and main configuration parameters. We then build 30 distinct such testbeds and systematically analyze their performance with an emphasis on element interoperability (by considering different combinations of hardware and software elements from different sources), the number and type of User Equipment (UE) as well as the Radio Access Network hardware and software elements to address the following questions: 1) How is the performance (in terms of bit rate and latency) impacted by different elements? 2) How does the number of UEs affect these results? 3) What is the impact of the user(s)' location(s) on the performance? 4) What is the impact of the UE type on these results? 5) How far does each testbed provide coverage? 6) And finally, what is the effect of the computing resources available to each open-source software? This study focuses on TDD testbeds.</description>

Abstract: The advent of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is setting a new benchmark in the field of wireless communications. IRS, with their groundbreaking ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves, have opened avenues for substantial enhancements in signal quality, network efficiency, and spectral usage. These surfaces dynamically reconfigure the propagation environment, leading to optimized signal paths and reduced interference. Concurrently, UAVs have emerged as dynamic, versatile elements within communication networks, offering high mobility and the ability to access and enhance coverage in areas where traditional, fixed infrastructure falls short. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the synergistic integration of IRS and UAVs in wireless networks, highlighting how this innovative combination substantially boosts network performance, particularly in terms of security, energy efficiency, and reliability. The versatility of UAVs, combined with the signal-manipulating prowess of IRS, creates a potent solution for overcoming the limitations of conventional communication setups, especially in challenging and underserved environments. Furthermore, the survey delves into the cutting-edge realm of Machine Learning (ML), exploring its role in the strategic deployment and operational optimization of UAVs equipped with IRS. The paper also underscores the latest research and practical advancements in this field, providing insights into real-world applications and experimental setups. It concludes by discussing the future prospects and potential directions for this emerging technology, positioning the IRS-UAV integration as a transformative force in the landscape of next-generation wireless</description>

      <title>An infinite server system with packing constraints and ranked servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A service system with multiple types of customers, arriving as Poisson processes, is considered. The system has infinite number of servers, ranked by $1,2,3, \ldots$; a server rank is its ``location." Each customer has an independent exponentially distributed service time, with the mean determined by its type. Multiple customers (possibly of different types) can be placed for service into one server, subject to ``packing'' constraints. Service times of different customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. The large-scale asymptotic regime is considered, such that the mean number of customers $r$ goes to infinity.
  We seek algorithms with the underlying objective of minimizing the location (rank) $U$ of the right-most (highest ranked) occupied (non-empty) server. Therefore, this objective seeks to minimize the total number $Q$ of occupied servers {\em and} keep the set of occupied servers as far at the ``left'' as possible, i.e., keep $U$ close to $Q$. In previous work, versions of {\em Greedy Random} (GRAND) algorithm have been shown to asymptotically minimize $Q/r$ as $r\to\infty$. In this paper we show that when these algorithms are combined with the First-Fit rule for ``taking'' empty servers, they asymptotically minimize $U/r$ as well.</description>

      <title>Do CAA, CT, and DANE Interlink in Certificate Deployments? A Web PKI Measurement Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrity and trust on the web build on X.509 certificates. Misuse or misissuance of these certificates threaten the Web PKI security model, which led to the development of several guarding techniques. In this paper, we study the DNS/DNSSEC records CAA and TLSA as well as CT logs from the perspective of the certificates in use. Our measurements comprise 4 million popular domains, for which we explore the existence and consistency of the different extensions. Our findings indicate that CAA is almost exclusively deployed in the absence of DNSSEC, while DNSSEC protected service names tend to not use the DNS for guarding certificates. Even though mainly deployed in a formally correct way, CAA CA-strings tend to not selectively separate CAs, and numerous domains hold certificates beyond the CAA semantic. TLSA records are repeatedly poorly maintained and occasionally occur without DNSSEC.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Vehicular Edge Computing with Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), the sensors such as cameras and LiDAR installed on intelligent vehicles provides higher capacity of executing computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks, thereby raising deployment costs. To address this issue, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been proposed to process data through Road Side Units (RSUs) to support real-time applications. This paper focuses on the Age of Information (AoI) as a key metric for data freshness and explores task offloading issues for vehicles under RSU communication resource constraints. We adopt a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach, allowing vehicles to autonomously make optimal data offloading decisions. However, MADRL poses risks of vehicle information leakage during communication learning and centralized training. To mitigate this, we employ a Federated Learning (FL) framework that shares model parameters instead of raw data to protect the privacy of vehicle users. Building on this, we propose an innovative distributed federated learning framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FGNN-MADRL), to optimize AoI across the system. For the first time, road scenarios are constructed as graph data structures, and a GNN-based federated learning framework is proposed, effectively combining distributed and centralized federated aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a new MADRL algorithm that simplifies decision making and enhances offloading efficiency, further reducing the decision complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach to other methods through simulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Time-to-Science by Streaming Detector Data Directly into Perlmutter Compute Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in detector technology have significantly increased the size and complexity of experimental data, and high-performance computing (HPC) provides a path towards more efficient and timely data processing. However, movement of large data sets from acquisition systems to HPC centers introduces bottlenecks owing to storage I/O at both ends. This manuscript introduces a streaming workflow designed for an high data rate electron detector that streams data directly to compute node memory at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), thereby avoiding storage I/O. The new workflow deploys ZeroMQ-based services for data production, aggregation, and distribution for on-the-fly processing, all coordinated through a distributed key-value store. The system is integrated with the detector's science gateway and utilizes the NERSC Superfacility API to initiate streaming jobs through a web-based frontend. Our approach achieves up to a 14-fold increase in data throughput and enhances predictability and reliability compared to a I/O-heavy file-based transfer workflow. Our work highlights the transformative potential of streaming workflows to expedite data analysis for time-sensitive experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Channel Uncertainty in Trusted Wireless Services via Repeated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous sub-networks in 6G poses new security and trust concerns and thus calls for a perimeterless-security model. Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) provides a trust-building approach via repeated interactions rather than relying on pre-established trust or central authentication. Such a trust-building process naturally supports dynamic trusted services across various service providers (SP) without the need for perimeter-based authentications; however, it remains vulnerable to environmental and system unreliability such as wireless channel uncertainty. In this study, we investigate channel unreliability in the trust-building framework based on repeated interactions for secure wireless services. We derive specific requirements for achieving cooperation between SP and client via a repeated game model and illustrate the implications of channel unreliability on sustaining trusted access services. We consider the framework optimization to guarantee SP-client cooperation, given a worst-case channel condition. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of cooperation region to represent the robustness of the trust-building process and explore the maximum cooperation area to enhance service resilience. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate the system performance over fading channels and verify our results.</description>
