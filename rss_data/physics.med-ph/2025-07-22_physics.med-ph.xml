      <title>Analyzing Blood Glucose Levels with Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy and Chemometric Multivariate Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the blood NIR absorbances are recorded using the FT-IR method. It is shown that when the absorbance curves are multiplied by the first derivative of the water absorbance spectrum as well as by the first derivative of the glucose absorbance, the peaks related to the water interferent in the blood are effectively removed from the blood absorbance spectra, allowing for better distinction of the peaks of the blood glucose. The PCR prediction using this method shows smaller errors compared to the PCR employing the net absorbances, while the number of derived principal components is smaller in the PCR method based on the derivatives than the one based on the net absorbances. Additionally, the prediction of blood glucose levels using a linear regression model based on the molar absorptivity of glucose also demonstrates acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>STEPC: A Pixel-wise Nonuniformity Correction Framework for Photon-Counting CT in Multi-material Imaging Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has demonstrated significant advancements in recent years; however, pixel-wise detector response nonuniformity remains a key challenge, frequently manifesting as ring artifacts in reconstructed images. Existing correction methods exhibit limited generalizability in complex multi-material scenarios, such as contrast-enhanced imaging. This study introduces a Signal-to-Uniformity Error Polynomial Calibration (STEPC) framework to address this issue. STEPC first fits multi-energy projections using a 2D polynomial surface to generate ideal references, then applies a nonlinear multi-energy polynomial model to predict and correct pixel-wise nonuniformity errors. The model is calibrated using homogeneous slab phantoms of different materials, including PMMA, aluminum, and iodinated contrast agents, enabling correction for both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced imaging. Experiments were performed on a custom Micro-PCCT system with phantoms and mouse. Correction performance of STEPC was evaluated using the mean local standard deviation (MLSD) in the projection domain and the ring artifact deviation (RAD) on the reconstructed images. STEPC consistently outperformed existing correction methods in both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced scenarios. It achieved the lowest MLSD and RAD for both phantoms and mouse scans. These results indicate that STEPC provides a robust and practical solution for correcting detector nonuniformity in multi-material PCCT imaging, witch position it as a promising general-purpose calibration framework for photon-counting CT systems.</description>

      <title>The Bundles of Intercrossing Fibers of the Extensor Mechanism of the Fingers Greatly Influence the Transmission of Muscle Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensor mechanism is a tendinous structure that plays an important role in finger function. It transmits forces from several intrinsic and extrinsic muscles to multiple bony attachments along the finger via sheets of collagen fibers. The most important attachments are located at the base of the middle and distal phalanges. How the forces from the muscles contribute to the forces at the attachment points, however, is not fully known. In addition to the well-accepted extensor medial and interosseous lateral bands of the extensor mechanism, there exist two layers of intercrossing fiber bundles (superficial interosseous medial fiber layer and deeper extensor lateral fiber layer), connecting them. In contrast to its common idealization as a minimal network of distinct strings, we built a numerical model consisting of fiber bundles to evaluate the role of multiple intercrossing fiber bundles in the production of static finger forces. We compared this more detailed model of the extensor mechanism to the idealized minimal network that only includes the extensor medial and interosseous lateral bands. We find that including bundles of intercrossing fiber bundles significantly affects force transmission, which itself depends on finger posture. We conclude that the intercrossing fiber bundles - traditionally left out in prior models since Zancolli's simplification - play an important role in force transmission and variation of the latter with posture.</description>

      <title>A Voxel-Wise Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Glioma Segmentation Using Spherical Projection-Based U-Net and Localized Refinement in Multi-Parametric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of glioma subregions in multi-parametric MRI (MP-MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and ambiguous boundaries. This study proposes an uncertainty-guided hybrid framework integrating spherical projection-based 2D modeling with targeted 3D refinement to enhance segmentation accuracy and interpretability. Methods: Using the BraTS2020 dataset (369 patients, four-modality MP-MRI), three 2D U-Nets were trained to segment enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Voxel-wise uncertainty was quantified via a spherical projection-based 2D nnU-Net, capturing prediction variance across deformed inputs. A 3D sliding window was used to identify high-uncertainty regions, which were refined using a dedicated 3D nnU-Net. Final outputs combined 2D and 3D predictions through a weighted fusion optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization. Results: The proposed method outperformed standalone 2D and 3D baselines, achieving Dice scores of 0.8124 (ET), 0.7499 (TC), and 0.9055 (WT), with consistent gains in sensitivity and visual coherence. Conclusion: This work presents a novel uncertainty-aware segmentation strategy that adaptively integrates 2D and 3D modeling. By focusing refinement on ambiguous regions, it improves both efficiency and accuracy, offering broad applicability to precision neuro-oncology and other high-stakes medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiosensitization Beyond Misrepair: A Mechanistic Model of Temperature-Enhanced DNA Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Hyperthermia (HT), characterized by elevated tissue temperatures above physiological levels, is a well-established radiosensitizer. When combined with radiotherapy (RT), forming thermoradiotherapy (TRT), a synergistic effect is observed across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. The greatest radiosensitization occurs when HT and RT are applied simultaneously. This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA repair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.
  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio (TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of vulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other physicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion processes, and medium density. The model includes misrepair effects phenomenologically, which make it consistent with other studies.
  Main results: The model reproduces TER values observed under simultaneous HT and RT in isolated plasmids with variable temperature. Our results indicate that, in addition to misrepair, other physical factors contribute to radiosensitization under concurrent treatment. Among these, the temperature-dependent amplification of DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section -- driven by enhanced DNA thermal fluctuations structure -- emerges as the second most influential factor.
  Significance: These findings suggest that thermal radiosensitization arises not only from impaired repair, but also from increased physical vulnerability of the DNA. The model provides mechanistic insight for optimizing TRT parameters.</description>

      <title>PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Diffusion Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets. For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one [$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types, providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Continuous sPatial-Temporal Deformable Image Registration (CPT-DIR) for motion modelling in radiotherapy: beyond classic voxel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial tool in radiotherapy for analyzing anatomical changes and motion patterns. Current DIR implementations rely on discrete volumetric motion representation, which often leads to compromised accuracy and uncertainty when handling significant anatomical changes and sliding boundaries. This limitation affects the reliability of subsequent contour propagation and dose accumulation procedures, particularly in regions with complex anatomical interfaces such as the lung-chest wall boundary. Given that organ motion is inherently a continuous process in both space and time, we aimed to develop a model that preserves these fundamental properties. Drawing inspiration from fluid mechanics, we propose a novel approach using implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous modeling of patient anatomical motion. This approach ensures spatial and temporal continuity while effectively unifying Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications to enable natural continuous motion modeling and frame interpolation. The integration of these specifications provides a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical deformation patterns. By leveraging the continuous representations, the CPT-DIR method significantly enhances registration and interpolation accuracy, automation, and speed. The method demonstrates superior performance in landmark and contour precision, particularly in challenging anatomical regions, representing a substantial advancement over conventional approaches in deformable image registration. The improved efficiency and accuracy of CPT-DIR make it particularly suitable for real-time adaptive radiotherapy applications.</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Neural Radiomic Sequence Model with Spatiotemporal Continuity for Quantifying 4DCT-based Pulmonary Ventilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of regional lung ventilation is essential for the management and treatment of lung cancer patients, supporting assessments of pulmonary function, optimization of therapeutic strategies, and monitoring of treatment response. Currently, ventilation scintigraphy using nuclear medicine techniques is widely employed in clinical practice; however, it is often time-consuming, costly, and entails additional radiation exposure. In this study, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify regions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset was analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and voxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the respiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming temporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated voxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions, we developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were generated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions. The proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range) Dice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78 (0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases. The temporal saliency map explained three key radiomic sequences in ventilation quantification: during lung exhalation, compromised pulmonary function region typically exhibits (1) an increasing trend of intensity and (2) a decreasing trend of homogeneity, in contrast to healthy lung tissue.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Models for Sparse-View Motion-Corrected Head Cone-beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a imaging modality widely used in head and neck diagnostics due to its accessibility and lower radiation dose. However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM-ADM substantially improves reconstruction quality over traditional model-based and learning-based baselines, particularly in highly undersampled scenarios. Our approach enables motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.</description>
