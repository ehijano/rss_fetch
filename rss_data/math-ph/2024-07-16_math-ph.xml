      <title>Quantum-inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Configuration Spaces of Points: A User's Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This extensive survey is an invited contribution to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, 2nd edition. It covers both classical and more modern aspects of configuration spaces of points on a "ground space" $M$. Most results pertain to $M$ a manifold. Configuration spaces of points have become so omnipresent in so many areas of mathematics, physics, and even the applied sciences, that a survey can only cover a selection of topics. We review key ideas, constructions, and results.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Fourier Quasicrystals from Lee-Yang Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Fourier quasicrystals with unit masses in arbitrary dimensions. This generalizes a one-dimensional construction of Kurasov and Sarnak. To do this, we employ a class of complex algebraic varieties avoiding certain regions in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which generalize hypersurfaces defined by Lee-Yang polynomials. We show that these are Delone almost periodic sets that have at most finite intersection with every discrete periodic set.</description>

      <title>A Frobenius-type theory for discrete systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach analogous to classical Frobenius theory for the analysis of singularities of ODEs in the case of discrete dynamical systems. Our methodology is based on the Roman-Rota theory of finite operators and relies crucially on the idea of preserving the Leibniz rule on a lattice of points by means of the notion of Rota algebras. The relevant cases of the Bessel, Hermite and Airy equations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Superintegrable families of magnetic monopoles with non-radial potential in curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some known results on the superintegrability of monopole systems in the three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space and in the 3D generalized Taub-NUT spaces. We show that these results can be extended to certain curved backgrounds that, for suitable choice of the domain of the coordinates, can be related via conformal transformations to systems in Taub-NUT spaces. These include the multi-fold Kepler systems as special cases. The curvature of the space is not constant and depends on a rational parameter that is also related to the order of the integrals. New results on minimal superintegrability when the electrostatic potential depends on both radial and angular variables are also presented.</description>

      <title>A review of graph neural network applications in mechanics-related domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanics-related problems often present unique challenges in achieving accurate geometric and physical representations, particularly for non-uniform structures. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising tool to tackle these challenges by adeptly learning from graph data with irregular underlying structures. Consequently, recent years have witnessed a surge in complex mechanics-related applications inspired by the advancements of GNNs. Despite this process, there is a notable absence of a systematic review addressing the recent advancement of GNNs in solving mechanics-related problems. To bridge this gap, this review article aims to provide an in-depth overview of the GNN applications in mechanics-related domains while identifying key challenges and outlining potential future research directions. In this review article, we begin by introducing the fundamental algorithms of GNNs that are widely employed in mechanics-related applications. We provide a concise explanation of their underlying principles to establish a solid understanding that will serve as a basis for exploring the applications of GNNs in mechanics-related domains. The scope of this paper is intended to cover the categorisation of literature into solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and interdisciplinary mechanics-related domains, providing a comprehensive summary of graph representation methodologies, GNN architectures, and further discussions in their respective subdomains. Additionally, open data and source codes relevant to these applications are summarised for the convenience of future researchers. This article promotes an interdisciplinary integration of GNNs and mechanics and provides a guide for researchers interested in applying GNNs to solve complex mechanics-related problems.</description>

      <title>Chaos and integrability in triangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize quantum dynamics in triangular billiards in terms of five properties: (1) the level spacing ratio (LSR), (2) spectral complexity (SC), (3) Lanczos coefficient variance, (4) energy eigenstate localisation in the Krylov basis, and (5) dynamical growth of spread complexity. The billiards we study are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable, depending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical trajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture emerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1) LSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos coefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov basis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a plateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small amount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn approximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles pseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are symmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors separately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined system approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with Poisson distributed spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum bungee jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a potential that is well-defined everywhere on the positive half-line, but diverges to $-\infty$ as $x\rightarrow 0^+$, may still be able to dynamically confine a particle to the (positive) half-line. We shall call this effect quantum bungee jumping: in the familiar quantum tunneling scenario one heading towards a wall is expected to bounce off it but instead passes through, while in the present scenario one jumping off a cliff is expected to fall but instead is pulled back. We discuss a particular example of a potential displaying this property, and study its energy eigenstates and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Seiberg-Witten curves of $\widehat{D}$-type Little Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little Strings are a type of non-gravitational quantum theories that contain extended degrees of freedom, but behave like ordinary Quantum Field Theories at low energies. A particular class of such theories in six dimensions is engineered as the world-volume theory of an M5-brane on a circle that probes a transverse orbifold geometry. Its low energy limit is a supersymmetric gauge theory that is described by a quiver in the shape of the Dynkin diagram of the affine extension of an ADE-group. While the so-called $\widehat{A}$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are very well studied, much less is known about the $\widehat{D}$-type, where for example the Seiberg-Witten curve (SWC) is only known in the case of the $\widehat{D}_4$ theory. In this work, we provide a general construction of this curve for arbitrary $\widehat{D}_{M}$ that respects all symmetries and dualities of the LST and is compatible with lower-dimensional results in the literature. For $M=4$ our construction reproduces the same curve as previously obtained by other methods. The form in which we cast the SWC for generic $\widehat{D}_M$ allows to study the behaviour of the LST under modular transformations and provides insights into a dual formulation as a circular quiver gauge theory with nodes of $Sp(M-4)$ and $SO(2M)$.</description>

      <title>On trilinear and quadrilinear equations associated with the lattice Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced in \cite{ZZN}, the trilinear Boussinesq equation is the natural form of the equation for the $\tau$-function of the lattice Boussinesq system. In this paper we study various aspects of this equation: its highly nontrivial derivation from the bilinear lattice AKP equation under dimensional reduction, a quadrilinear dual lattice equation, conservation laws, and periodic reductions leading to higher-dimensional integrable maps and their Laurent property. Furthermore, we consider a higher Gel'fand-Dikii lattice system, its periodic reductions and Laurent property. As a special application, from both a trilinear Boussinesq recurrence as well as a higher Gel'fand-Dikii system of three bilinear recurrences, we establish novel integer sequences, which are beyond the Somos class of sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the frequency ratios $\tau\equiv \omega_z/\omega_{\rho}$ for which the Hamiltonian system with a potential \[ V=\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{2}\Big({\omega_{\rho}}^2(x^2+y^2)+{\omega_z}^2 z^2\Big) \] is completely integrable. We relate this result to the existence of conformal Killing tensors of the associated Eisenhart metric on $\mathbb{R}^{1, 4}$. Finally we show that trajectories of a particle moving under the influence of the potential $V$ are not unparametrised geodesics of any Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally dominated instantons and instability of dS, AdS and Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>Emergent family of Tsallis entropies from the $q$-deformed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of a formula for the $q$-generalised multinomial coefficient rooted in the $q$-deformed algebra, a foundational framework in the study of nonextensive statistics. Previous approximate expressions in the literature diverge as $q$ approaches 2 (or 0, depending on convention). In contrast, our derived formula provides an exact, smooth function for all real values of $q$, expressed as an infinite series expansion involving Tsallis entropies with sequential entropic indices, coupled with Bernoulli numbers. This formulation is achieved through the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function, stemming from the $q$-deformed factorials. Thus, our formula offers a distinctive characterisation of Tsallis entropy within the $q$-deformed combinatorics. Furthermore, we discuss extending our results to encompass more general, affinity-sensitive cases based on the previously established framework of affinity-based extended entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-particle Arnol'd cat is a generalization of the Hamiltonian system, both classical and quantum, whose period evolution operator is the renown map that bears its name. It is obtained following the Joos-Zeh prescription for decoherence, by adding a number of scattering particles in the configuration space of the cat. Quantization follows swiftly, if the Hamiltonian approach, rather than the semiclassical, is adopted. I have studied this system in a series of previous works, focusing on the problem of quantum-classical correspondence. In this paper I test the dynamics of this system by two related yet different indicators: the time autocorrelation function of the canonical position and the out of time correlator of position and momentum.</description>

Abstract: I study the scaling behavior in the physical parameters of dynamical entropies, classical and quantum, in a specifically devised model of collision-induced decoherence in a chaotic system. The treatment is fully canonical and no approximations are involved or infinite limits taken. I present this model in a detailed way, in order to clarify my views in the debate about the nature, definition, and relevance of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>T-Duality and $T \overline{T}$-like Deformations of Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the interplay between T-duality and classical stress tensor deformations in two-dimensional sigma models. We first show that a general Abelian T-duality commutes with the $T \overline{T}$ deformation, which can be engineered by a gravitational dressing. Then, by using an auxiliary field formulation of stress tensor deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM), we prove that non-Abelian T-duality and arbitrary $T \overline{T}$-like flows also commute for theories in this class. We argue that all such auxiliary field deformations of both the PCM and its T-dual are classically integrable.</description>

      <title>Visitation Dynamics of $d$-Dimensional Fractional Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a paradigmatic strongly non-Markovian process with broad applications in various fields. Despite their importance, the properties of the territory covered by a $d$-dimensional fBm have remained elusive so far. Here, we study the visitation dynamics of the fBm by considering the time $\tau_n$ required to visit a site, defined as a unit cell of a $d$-dimensional lattice, when $n$ sites have been visited. Relying on scaling arguments, we determine all temporal regimes of the probability distribution function of $\tau_n$. These results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations that employ large-deviation Monte Carlo algorithms. Besides these theoretical aspects, our results account for the tracking data of telomeres in the nucleus of mammalian cells, microspheres in an agorose gel, and vacuoles in the amoeba, which are experimental realizations of fBm.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $a$-step walks of random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks in the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir Energy in Horava-Lifshitz Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two neutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field Theory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive fermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel plates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To calculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a MIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the Casimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical exponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.</description>

      <title>Riesz means asymptotics for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and prove two-term asymptotics for their Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. Moreover, when the underlying domain is convex, we obtain universal, non-asymptotic bounds that correctly reproduce the two leading terms in the asymptotics and depend on the domain only through simple geometric characteristics. An important ingredient in the proof of the latter result is a pointwise bound for the heat kernel of the Neumann Laplacian in a convex domain with universal constants. Additional ingredients in our proof are non-asymptotic versions of various Tauberian theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the collective photon emission from atomic clouds both the atomic transition frequency and the decay rate are modified compared to a single isolated atom, leading to the effects of superradiance and subradiance. In this Letter, we analyse the properties of the Euclidean random matrix associated to the radiative dynamics of a cold atomic cloud, previously investigated in the contexts of photon localization and Dicke super- and subradiance. We present evidence of a new type of phase transition, surprisingly controlled by the cooperativeness parameter, rather than the spatial density or the diagonal disorder. The numerical results corroborate the occurrence of such a phase transition at a critical value of the cooperativeness parameter, above which the lower edge of the spectrum vanishes exhibiting a macroscopic accumulation of eigenvalues. Independent evaluations based on the two phenomena provide the same value of the critical cooperativeness parameter.</description>

      <title>Metastability in Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses, in which the couplings are in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$ stable law for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We show a sharp description of metastability on exponential timescales, in a form that is believed to hold for Glauber/Langevin dynamics for many mean-field spin glass models, but only known rigorously for the Random Energy Models. Namely, we establish a decomposition of the state space into sub-exponentially many wells, and show that the projection of the Glauber dynamics onto which well it resides in, asymptotically behaves like a Markov chain on wells with certain explicit transition rates. In particular, mixing inside wells occurs on much shorter timescales than transit times between wells, and the law of the next well the Glauber dynamics will fall into depends only on which well it currently resides in, not its full configuration. We can deduce consequences like an exact expression for the two-time autocorrelation functions that appear in the activated aging literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two delta-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio 3:1 in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a delta-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correlation functions in 2D critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy identities play an important role in the theory of symmetric functions. It is known that Cauchy sums for the $q$-Whittaker and the skew Schur polynomials produce the same factorized expressions modulo a $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We consider the sums with restrictions on the length of the first rows for labels of both polynomials and prove an identity which relates them. The proof is based on techniques from integrable probability: we rewrite the identity in terms of two probability measures: the $q$-Whittaker measure and the periodic Schur measure. The relation follows by comparing their Fredholm determinant formulas.</description>

Abstract: We consider a Riemmaniann compact manifold $M$, the associated Laplacian $\Delta$ and the corresponding Brownian motion $X_t$, $t\geq 0.$ Given a Lipschitz function $V:M\to\mathbb R$ we consider the operator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta+V$, which acts on differentiable functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ via the operator
  $$\frac{1}{2} \Delta f(x)+\,V(x)f(x) ,$$ for all $x\in M$.
  Denote by $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0,$ the semigroup acting on functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ given by $$P_{t}^V (f)(x)\,:=\, \mathbb E_{x} \big[e^{\int_0^{t} V(X_r)\,dr} f(X_t)\big].\,$$
  We will show that this semigroup is a continuous-time version of the discrete-time Ruelle operator.
  Consider the positive differentiable eigenfunction $F: M \to \mathbb{R}$ associated to the main eigenvalue $\lambda$ for the semigroup $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0$. From the function $F$, in a procedure similar to the one used in the case of discrete-time Thermodynamic Formalism, we can associate via a coboundary procedure a certain stationary Markov semigroup. The probability on the Skhorohod space obtained from this new stationary Markov semigroup can be seen as a stationary Gibbs state associated with the potential $V$. We define entropy, pressure, the continuous-time Ruelle operator and we present a variational principle of pressure for such a setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider the wave and Klein-Gordon equations on the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ ($n \geq2$) in a framework based on weak-$L^{p}$ spaces. First, we establish dispersive estimates on Lorentz spaces in the context of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Then, employing those estimates, we prove global well-posedness of solutions and an exponential asymptotic stability property. Moreover, we develop a scattering theory and construct wave operators in such singular framework.</description>

Abstract: With the growth of geometric science, including the methods of exploring the world of information by means of modern geometry, there has always been a mysterious and fascinating ambiguous link between geometric, topological and dynamical characteristics with quantum entanglement. Since geometry studies the interrelations between elements such as distance and curvature, it provides the information sciences with powerful structures that yield practically useful and understandable descriptions of integrable quantum systems. We explore here these structures in a physical system of $N$ interaction spin-$1/2$ under all-range Ising model. By performing the system dynamics, we determine the Fubini-Study metric defining the relevant quantum state space. Applying Gaussian curvature within the scope of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we proved that the dynamics happens on a closed two-dimensional manifold having both a dumbbell-shape structure and a spherical topology. The geometric and topological phases appearing during the system evolution processes are sufficiently discussed. Subsequently, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem by achieving the time-optimal evolution. By restricting the whole system to a two spin-$1/2$ system, we investigate the relevant entanglement from two viewpoints; The first is of geometric nature and explores how the entanglement level affects derived geometric structures such as the Fubini-Study metric, the Gaussian curvature, and the geometric phase. The second is of dynamic nature and addresses the entanglement effect on the evolution speed and the related Fubini-Study distance. Further, depending on the degree of entanglement, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem.</description>

In this paper, we explore another aspect of the relation between $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and operator theory. Specifically, we study an example of an integral operator associated with Painlev\'e equations and whose spectral traces are related to correlation functions of the 2d Ising model. This operator does not correspond to a canonically quantized Seiberg-Witten curve, but its kernel can nevertheless be interpreted as the density matrix of an ideal Fermi gas. Adopting the approach of Tracy and Widom, we provide an explicit expression for its eigenfunctions via an $\mathrm{O}(2)$ matrix model. We then show that these eigenfunctions are computed by surface defects in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ super Yang-Mills in the self-dual phase of the $\Omega$-background. Our result also yields a strong coupling expression for such defects which resums the instanton expansion. Even though we focus on one concrete example, we expect these results to hold for a larger class of operators arising in the context of isomonodromic deformation equations.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>

Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the transport properties of interface-type, analog memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface-type, analog memristors have quite a reputation for real-time applications in edge sensorics, edge computing, and neuromorphic computing. The n-type conducting BiFeO3 (BFO) is such an interface-type, analog memristor which is also nonlinear and can therefore not only store, but also process data in the same memristor cell without data transfer between the data storage unit and the data processing unit. Here we present a physical memristor model which describes the hysteretic current-voltage curves of the BFO memristor in the small and large current-voltage range. Extracted internal state variables are reconfigured by the ion drift in the two write branches and are determining the electron transport in the two read branches. Simulation of electronic circuits with the BFO interface-type, analog memristors was not possible so far because previous physical memristor models have not captured the full range of internal state variables. We show quantitative agreement between modeled and experimental current-voltage curves exemplarily of three different BFO memristors in the small and large current-voltage ranges. Extracted dynamic and static internal state variables in the two full write branches and in the two full read branches, respectively, can be used for simulating electronic circuits with BFO memristors, e.g. in edge sensorics, edge computing, and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Representing Arbitrary Ground States of Toric Code by Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Scattering between orthogonally wobbling kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resonant energy transfer mechanism, responsible for the presence of fractal patterns in the velocity diagrams of kink-antikink scattering, is analyzed for a family of two-component scalar field theory models, in which the kink solutions have two shape modes (one longitudinal and one orthogonal to the kink orbit), in addition to the zero mode, and in which energy redistribution can occur among these three discrete modes. We investigate the scattering between wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited, examining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the initial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with respect to the $\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay between multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering insights distinct from those observed in simpler models.</description>
