      <title>Detecting Musical Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Text-to-Music (TTM) platforms has democratized music creation, enabling users to effortlessly generate high-quality compositions. However, this innovation also presents new challenges to musicians and the broader music industry. This study investigates the detection of AI-generated songs using the FakeMusicCaps dataset by classifying audio as either deepfake or human. To simulate real-world adversarial conditions, tempo stretching and pitch shifting were applied to the dataset. Mel spectrograms were generated from the modified audio, then used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network. In addition to presenting technical results, this work explores the ethical and societal implications of TTM platforms, arguing that carefully designed detection systems are essential to both protecting artists and unlocking the positive potential of generative AI in music.</description>

      <title>Introducing voice timbre attribute detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on explaining the timbre conveyed by speech signals and introduces a task termed voice timbre attribute detection (vTAD). In this task, voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human perception. A pair of speech utterances is processed, and their intensity is compared in a designated timbre descriptor. Moreover, a framework is proposed, which is built upon the speaker embeddings extracted from the speech utterances. The investigation is conducted on the VCTK-RVA dataset. Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2) the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced generalization capability. The VCTK-RVA dataset and open-source code are available on the website https://github.com/vTAD2025-Challenge/vTAD.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Model of Acoustic Power Transfer Through Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic Power Transfer is a relatively new technology. It is a modern type of a wireless interface, where data signals and supply voltages are transmitted, with the use of mechanical waves, through a medium. The simplest application of such systems is the measurement of frequency response for audio speakers. It consists of a variable signal generator, a measuring amplifier which drives an acoustic source and the loudspeaker driver. The receiver contains a microphone circuit with a level recorder. Acoustic Power Transfer could have many applications, such as: Cochlear Implants, Sonar Systems and Wireless Charging. However, it is a new technology, thus it needs further investigation.</description>

      <title>LAV: Audio-Driven Dynamic Visual Generation with Neural Compression and StyleGAN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Dynamics in Physical Modelling Synthesis using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</description>

      <title>T2A-Feedback: Improving Basic Capabilities of Text-to-Audio Generation via Fine-grained AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved remarkable progress in generating a variety of audio outputs from language prompts. However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&amp;Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This highlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics. Utilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference dataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each accompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a benchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling scenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models. Finally, we demonstrate how T2A-FeedBack can enhance current state-of-the-art audio model. With simple preference tuning, the audio generation model exhibits significant improvements in both simple (AudioCaps test set) and complex (T2A-EpicBench) scenarios.</description>

      <title>ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times. Code is available at:https://github.com/fchest/ListenNet.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Learning for Acoustic Few-Shot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled data are limited and self-supervised learning is one of the most important approaches for reducing labelling requirements. While it has been extensively explored in the image domain, it has so far not received the same amount of attention in the acoustic domain. Yet, reducing labelling is a key requirement for many acoustic applications. Specifically in bioacoustic, there are rarely sufficient labels for fully supervised learning available. This has led to the widespread use of acoustic recognisers that have been pre-trained on unrelated data for bioacoustic tasks. We posit that training on the actual task data and combining self-supervised pre-training with few-shot classification is a superior approach that has the ability to deliver high accuracy even when only a few labels are available. To this end, we introduce and evaluate a new architecture that combines CNN-based preprocessing with feature extraction based on state space models (SSMs). This combination is motivated by the fact that CNN-based networks alone struggle to capture temporal information effectively, which is crucial for classifying acoustic signals. SSMs, specifically S4 and Mamba, on the other hand, have been shown to have an excellent ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequence data. We pre-train this architecture using contrastive learning on the actual task data and subsequent fine-tuning with an extremely small amount of labelled data. We evaluate the performance of this proposed architecture for ($n$-shot, $n$-class) classification on standard benchmarks as well as real-world data. Our evaluation shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art architectures on the few-shot classification problem.</description>

      <title>ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

      <title>CoGenAV: Versatile Audio-Visual Representation Learning via Contrastive-Generative Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent synchronization between a speaker's lip movements, voice, and the underlying linguistic content offers a rich source of information for improving speech processing tasks, especially in challenging conditions where traditional audio-only systems falter. We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 20.5 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acoustic sensitivity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals highly impacts their intelligibility in noisy urban environments. In this Letter, the disturbance sensing level is examined with perceptual listening tests that demonstrate the impact of their append High Internal Noise (HIN) profile on intelligibility. This particular sensing level is then proposed as additional aid to ASD diagnosis. In this Letter, a novel intelligibility enhancement scheme is also introduced for ASD particular circumstances. For this proposal, harmonic features estimated from speech signal frames are considered as center frequencies of auditory filterbanks. A gain factor is further applied to the output of the filtered samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposal improved the acoustic intelligibility of ASD and Neurotypicals (NT) people considering four acoustic noises at different signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>uDistil-Whisper: Label-Free Data Filtering for Knowledge Distillation in Low-Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01257v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation using pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare with and filter low-quality examples, making the process dependent on human labels. Additionally, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. To address this, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best-distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 WER points and are on par with or outperform similar supervised data filtering setups. When scaling the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. Our models are also 25-50% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.

      <description>arXiv:2409.14074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the medical domain serves as a foundational task for various downstream applications such as speech translation, spoken language understanding, and voice-activated assistants. This technology improves patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics. In this work, we introduce MultiMed, the first multilingual medical ASR dataset, along with the first collection of small-to-large end-to-end medical ASR models, spanning five languages: Vietnamese, English, German, French, and Mandarin Chinese. To our best knowledge, MultiMed stands as the world's largest medical ASR dataset across all major benchmarks: total duration, number of recording conditions, number of accents, and number of speaking roles. Furthermore, we present the first multilinguality study for medical ASR, which includes reproducible empirical baselines, a monolinguality-multilinguality analysis, Attention Encoder Decoder (AED) vs Hybrid comparative study and a linguistic analysis. We present practical ASR end-to-end training schemes optimized for a fixed number of trainable parameters that are common in industry settings. All code, data, and models are available online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/MultiMed.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of decentralized computing, as in the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and personalized healthcare, it is increasingly important to process time-dependent signals at the edge efficiently: right at the place where the temporal data are collected, avoiding time-consuming, insecure, and costly communication with a centralized computing facility (or cloud). However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue-to-digital and time-to-frequency). Here, we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching a software-level accuracy of 96.2% for the TI-46-Word speech-recognition task. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature dopant-network-processing-unit (DNPU) layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing (AIMC) chip, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With the DNPU feature extraction consuming 100s nW and AIMC-based classification having the potential for less than 10 fJ per multiply-accumulate operation, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in-materia computing hardware.</description>
