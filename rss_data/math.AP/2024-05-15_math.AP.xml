      <title>Global existence and multiplicity of solutions for logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  $$
  -\Delta u+h(x)u=u\log u^{2}
  $$ on a locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$, where $\Delta$ is a discrete Laplacian operator on the graph, $h$ is the potential function. Different from the classical methods in Euclidean space, we obtain the existence of global solutions to the equation by using the variational method from local to global, which is inspired by the works of Lin and Yang in \cite{LinYang}. In addition, when the potential function $h$ is sign-changing, we prove that the equation admits infinitely many solutions with high energy by using the symmetric mountain pass theorem. We extend the classical results in Euclidean space to discrete graphs.</description>

      <title>On special properties of solutions to Camassa-Holm equation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study unique continuation properties of solutions to the b-family of equations. This includes the Camassa-Holm and the Degasperi-Procesi models. We prove that for both, the initial value problem and the periodic boundary value problem, the unique continuation results found in \cite{LiPo} are optimal. More precisely, the result established there for the constant $c_0=0$ fails for any constant $c_0\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Area-Preserving Anisotropic Mean Curvature Flow in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of sets by anisotropic curvature under a volume constraint in the plane. We establish the exponential convergence of the area-preserving anisotropic flat flow to a disjoint union of Wulff shapes of equal area, the critical point of the anisotropic perimeter functional. This is an anisotropic analogue of the results in the isotropic case studied in \cite{julin2022}. The novelty of our approach is in using the Cahn-Hoffman map to parametrize boundary components as small perturbations of the Wulff shape. In addition, we show that certain reflection comparison symmetries are preserved by the flat flow, which lets us obtain uniform bounds on the distance between the convergent profile and the initial data.</description>

      <title>On Instability Properties of the Fractional Calder\'{o}n Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calder\'on problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calder\'on problem in the regime of fractional powers $s\in (0,1)$. We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical $L^{\frac{n}{2s}}$ potentials and constant background metrics. Secondly, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with $L^{\frac{n}{2s}}$ potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings we make use of the methods introduced in \cite{KRS21} and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator while in the second setting involving low regularity metrics this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from \cite{RS18} to generic geometries and variable coefficients and further also discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calder\'on problem from \cite{RS20} are optimal.</description>

      <title>Group Dispersal Modelling revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to the steady incompressible Euler equations with source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the non-uniqueness of stationary solutions to steady incompressible Euler equations with source terms. Based on the convex integration scheme developed by De Lellis and Sz\'{e}kelyhidi, the Euler system is reformulated as a differential inclusion. The key point is to construct the corresponding plane-wave solutions via high frequency perturbations. Then we use iteration and Baire category argument to conclude that there exist a large amount of weak solutions with given energy profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for some given suitable density and pressure, there exist infinitely many compactly supported solutions with prescribed energy profile. The proof is mainly based on the convex integration scheme. We construct suitable subsolutions and localized plane-wave solutions to the reformulated system, and weak solutions are obtained by iterating these subsolutions.</description>

      <title>Global existence of small data weak solutions to the semilinear wave equations with time-dependent scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence of small data weak solutions to the $n-$dimensional semilinear wave equation $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$ with time-dependent scale-invariant damping, where $n\geq 2$, $t\geq 1$, $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2]$ and $p&gt;1$. This equation can be changed into the semilinear generalized Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2u-t^m\Delta u=t^{\alpha(m)}|u|^p$, where $m=m(\mu)&gt;0$ and $\alpha(m)\in\Bbb R$ are two suitable constants. At first, for the more general semilinear Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2v-t^m\Delta v=t^{\alpha}|v|^p$ with any fixed constant $m&gt;0$ and arbitrary parameter $\alpha\in\Bbb R$, we shall show that in the case of $\alpha\leq -2$, $n\geq 3$ and $p&gt;1$, the small data weak solution $v$ exists globally; in the case of $\alpha&gt;-2$, through determining the conformal exponent $p_{conf}(n,m,\alpha)&gt;1$, the global small data weak solution $v$ exists when some extra restrictions of $p\geq p_{conf}(n,m,\alpha)$ are given. Returning to the original equation $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, the corresponding global existence results on the small data solution $u$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Velocity-vorticity geometric constraints for the energy conservation of 3D ideal incompressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the 3D Euler equations and we first prove a criterion for energy conservation for weak solutions with velocity satisfying additional assumptions in fractional Sobolev spaces with respect to the space variables, balanced by proper integrability with respect to time. Next, we apply the criterion to study the energy conservation of solution of the Beltrami type, carefully applying properties of products in (fractional and possibly negative) Sobolev spaces and employing a suitable bootstrap argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a sufficient condition for a step-two Carnot group to satisfy the quasi Bakry-\'Emery curvature condition. As an application, we establish the gradient estimate for the heat semigroup on the free step-two Carnot group with three generators $N_{3,2}$. Moreover, high order gradient estimates and the Riemannian counterparts are also deduced under an extra condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Sobolev regularity estimates for solutions of non-local parabolic equations with locally unbounded drift satisfying some minimal assumptions. These results yield Krylov bound for the corresponding Feller stable process as well as some a priori regularity estimates on solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations. A key element of our arguments is a parabolic operator norm inequality that we prove using some ideas of Adams and Krylov.</description>

Abstract: In this work we prove that the initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) for the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries equation \begin{align*} \left. \begin{array}{rlr} u_t+\partial_x^5 u+u\partial_x u&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=0,&amp;\quad x\in\mathbb R^+,\; t\in\mathbb R^+,\\ u(x,0)&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=g(x),&amp;\\ u(0,t)=h_1(t),\, \partial_x u(0,t)&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=h_2(t),\,\partial_x^2 u(0,t)=h_3(t), \end{array} \right\} \end{align*} is locally well posed, when the data $g$, $h_1$, $h_2$, $h_3$ are taken in such a way that $g\in H^s(\mathbb R_x^+)$, and $h_{j+1}\in H^{\frac{s+2-j}5}(\mathbb R_t^+)$, $j=0,1,2$, $s\in [0,\frac{11}4)\setminus \{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52\}$, and satisfy the following compatibility conditions: \begin{align*} g(0)=h_1(0) \text{ if } \frac12&lt;s&lt;\frac32;\\ g(0)=h_1(0),\; g'(0)=h_2(0) \text{ if } \frac32&lt;s&lt;\frac52;\\ g(0)=h_1(0), \; g'(0)=h_2(0),\; g''(0)=h_3(0) \text{ if } \frac52&lt;s&lt;\frac{11}4. \end{align*} Besides, we prove that the nonlinear part of the solution is smoother than the initial datum $g$.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear instability of vortex columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider vortex column solutions $v = V(r) e_\theta + W(r) e_z$ to the $3$D Euler equations. We give a mathematically rigorous construction of the countable family of unstable modes discovered by Liebovich and Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech. 126, 1983) via formal asymptotic analysis. The unstable modes exhibit $O(1)$ growth rates and concentrate on a ring $r= r_0$ asymptotically as the azimuthal and axial wavenumbers $n, \alpha \to \infty$ with a fixed ratio. We construct these so-called ring modes with an inner-outer gluing procedure. Finally, we prove that each linear instability implies nonlinear instability for vortex columns. In particular, our analysis yields nonlinear instability for the Batchelor trailing line vortex $V(r) := \frac{q}{r} (1-\mathrm{e}^{-r^2})$ and $W(r) := \mathrm{e}^{-r^2}$ when $0 &lt; q \ll 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variational model for soap films in which the films are represented by sets with fixed small volume rather than surfaces. In this problem, a minimizing sequence of completely "wet" films, or sets of finite perimeter spanning a wire frame, may converge to a film containing both wet regions of positive volume and collapsed (dry) surfaces. When collapsing occurs, these limiting objects lie outside the original minimization class and instead are admissible for a relaxed problem. Here we show that the relaxation and the original formulation are equivalent by approximating the collapsed films in the relaxed class by wet films in the original class.</description>

Abstract: For the Schr\"odinger equation with a cubic-quintic, focusing-focusing nonlinearity in one space dimension, this article proves the local asymptotic completeness of the family of small standing solitary waves under even perturbations in the energy space. For this model, perturbative of the integrable cubic Schr\"odinger equation for small solutions, the linearized equation around a small solitary wave has an internal mode, whose contribution to the dynamics is handled by the Fermi golden rule.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles for weakly $1$-coercive operators with applications to capillary and prescribed mean curvature graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish maximum principles for weakly 1-coercive operators $L$ on complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds $M$. In particular, we search for conditions under which one can guarantee that solutions $u$ of differential equations of the form $L(u)\geq f(u)$ satisfy $f(u)\leq 0$ on $M$. The case of weakly $p$-coercive operators with $p&gt;1$, including the $p$-Laplacian and in particular the Laplace-Beltrami operator for $p=2$, has been considered in a recent paper of ours. As a consequence of the main results we infer comparison principles for that kind of operators. Furthermore we apply them to geometric situations dealing with the mean curvature operator, which is a typical weakly 1-coercive operator. We first consider the case of $\mathcal C^1$ operators $L$ acting on functions $u$ of class $\mathcal C^2$ and, in the last section of the paper, we show how our results can be extended to the case of less regular operators $L$ acting on functions $u$ which are just continuous and locally $W^{1,1}$ regular.</description>

      <title>Regularity and nondegeneracy for nonlocal Bernoulli problems with variable kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Bernoulli free boundary problem where the underlying differential operator is a nonlocal, non-translation-invariant elliptic operator of order $2s\in (0,2)$. Because of the lack of translation invariance, the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension is unavailable, and we must work with the nonlocal problem directly instead of transforming to a thin free boundary problem. We prove global H\"older continuity of minimizers for both the one- and two-phase problems. Next, for the one-phase problem, we show H\"older continuity at the free boundary with the optimal exponent $s$. We also prove matching nondegeneracy estimates. A key novelty of our work is that all our findings hold without requiring any regularity assumptions on the kernel of the nonlocal operator. This characteristic makes them crucial in the development of a universal regularity theory for nonlocal free boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay for fractional Schr\"odinger parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss exponential decay in $L^p(R^N)$, $1\leq p \leq \infty$, of solutions of a fractional Schr\"odinger parabolic equation with a locally uniformly integrable potential. The exponential type of the semigroup of solutions is considered and its dependence in
  $1\leq p \leq \infty$ is addressed. We characterise a large class of potentials for which solutions decay exponentially.</description>

      <title>A Sharp condition on global wellposedness of Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a sharp condition on the mass of the initial data for the global existence of the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation. As a corollary, we prove that if the strength of interaction is less than the Bogomolny bound, then, for a large enough mass of initial data, there exists a globally defined solution. On the other hand, for the interactions which are above the Bogomolny bound, the critical mass condition on the initial data for the global existence depends on the strength of the self-interacting field. Then, we show that the states with the initial critical mass and zero energy are standing wave solutions and globally well-posed. Moreover, they are static if the self-interacting field is large enough and non-static for small self-interacting field.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of sub-elliptic harmonic maps into CAT(0) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the local Lipschitz continuity of sub-elliptic harmonic maps between certain singular spaces, more specifically from the $n$-dimensional Heisenberg group into $CAT(0)$ spaces. Our main theorem establishes that these maps have the desired Lipschitz regularity, extending the H\"older regularity in this setting proven by Y. Gui et. al and obtaining same regularity as in the work of H-C. Zhang and X-P. Zhu for certain sub-Riemannian geometries, see also the works of A. Mondino and D. Semola, as well as N. Gigli, for generalisations to RCD spaces. The present result paves the way for a general regularity theory of sub-elliptic harmonic maps, providing a versatile approach applicable beyond the Heisenberg group.</description>
