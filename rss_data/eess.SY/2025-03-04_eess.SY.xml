      <title>Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for State Avoidance in Discrete Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.</description>

      <title>Traffic Priority-Aware 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi Coexistence with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coexistence of 5G new radio unlicensed (NR-U) and Wi-Fi is highly prone to the collisions among NR-U gNBs (5G base stations) and Wi-Fi APs (access points). To improve performance and fairness for both networks, various collision resolution mechanisms have been proposed to replace the simple listen-before-talk (LBT) scheme used in the current 5G standard. We address two gaps in the literature: first, the lack of a comprehensive performance comparison among the proposed collision resolution mechanisms and second, the impact of multiple traffic priority classes. Through extensive simulations, we compare the performance of several recently proposed collision resolution mechanisms for NR-U/Wi-Fi coexistence. We extend one of these mechanisms to handle multiple traffic priorities. We then develop a traffic-aware multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the scenario of coexistence of high-priority traffic gNB user equipment (UE) with multiple lower-priority traffic UEs and Wi-Fi stations. The objective is to ensure low latency for high-priority gNB traffic while increasing the airtime fairness among the NR-U and Wi-Fi networks. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm lowers the channel access delay of high-priority traffic while improving the fairness among both networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault Diagnosis in Lithium-Ion Battery Packs: A Structural Approach with Moving Horizon Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe and reliable operation of lithium-ion battery packs depends on effective fault diagnosis. However, model-based approaches often encounter two major challenges: high computational complexity and extensive sensor requirements. To address these bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel approach that harnesses the structural properties of battery packs, including cell uniformity and the sparsity of fault occurrences. We integrate this approach into a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) framework and estimate fault signals such as internal and external short circuits and faults in voltage and current sensors. To mitigate computational demands, we propose a hierarchical solution to the MHE problem. The proposed solution breaks up the pack-level MHE problem into smaller problems and solves them efficiently. Finally, we perform extensive simulations across various battery pack configurations and fault types to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results highlight that the proposed approach simultaneously reduces the computational demands and sensor requirements of fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Communication and Control Co-design in Non-cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit a communication-control co-design problem for a class of two-player stochastic differential games on an infinite horizon. Each 'player' represents two active decision makers, namely a scheduler and a remote controller, which cooperate to optimize over a global objective while competing with the other player. Each player's scheduler can only intermittently relay state information to its respective controller due to associated cost/constraint to communication. The scheduler's policy determines the information structure at the controller, thereby affecting the quality of the control inputs. Consequently, it leads to the classical communication-control trade-off problem. A high communication frequency improves the control performance of the player on account of a higher communication cost, and vice versa. Under suitable information structures of the players, we first compute the Nash controller policies for both players in terms of the conditional estimate of the state. Consequently, we reformulate the problem of computing Nash scheduler policies (within a class of parametrized randomized policies) into solving for the steady-state solution of a generalized Sylvester equation. Since the above-mentioned reformulation involves infinite sum of powers of the policy parameters, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically compute a Nash equilibrium using a truncated polynomial approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the Nash control and scheduler policies using extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Wall-Following Control for Unmanned Ground Vehicles Using Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned ground vehicles operating in complex environments must adaptively adjust to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances to perform tasks such as wall following and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces an adaptive control approach based on spiking neural networks for wall fitting and tracking, which learns and adapts to unforeseen disturbances. We propose real-time wall-fitting algorithms to model unknown wall shapes and generate corresponding trajectories for the vehicle to follow. A discretized linear quadratic regulator is developed to provide a baseline control signal based on an ideal vehicle model. Point matching algorithms then identify the nearest matching point on the trajectory to generate feedforward control inputs. Finally, an adaptive spiking neural network controller, which adjusts its connection weights online based on error signals, is integrated with the aforementioned control algorithms. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this adaptive control framework outperforms the traditional linear quadratic regulator in tracking complex trajectories and following irregular walls, even in the presence of partial actuator failures and state estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Meta-Policy Optimization via Zeroth-Order Estimation: A Linear Quadratic Regulator Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-learning has been proposed as a promising machine learning topic in recent years, with important applications to image classification, robotics, computer games, and control systems. In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide stability and convergence guarantees for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and local smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We provide the sample complexity conditions for these theoretical guarantees, as well as a numerical example at the end to corroborate this perspective.</description>

      <title>Certifying Lyapunov Stability of Black-Box Nonlinear Systems via Counterexample Guided Synthesis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications.
  Our work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.
  Our numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.</description>

      <title>Co-state Neural Network for Real-time Nonlinear Optimal Control with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to solve nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) with constrained control input in real-time using neural networks (NNs). We introduce what we have termed co-state Neural Network (CoNN) that learns the mapping from any given state value to its corresponding optimal co-state trajectory based on the Pontryagin's Minimum (Maximum) Principle (PMP). In essence, the CoNN parameterizes the Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) that results from the PMP for various initial states. The CoNN is trained using data generated from numerical solutions of TPBVPs for unconstrained OCPs to learn the mapping from a state to its corresponding optimal co-state trajectory. For better generalizability, the CoNN is also trained to respect the first-order optimality conditions (system dynamics). The control input constraints are satisfied by solving a quadratic program (QP) given the predicted optimal co-states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoNN-based controller in a feedback scheme for numerical examples with both unconstrained and constrained control input. We also verify that the controller can handle unknown disturbances effectively.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00604v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}. These findings provide guidance for selecting current conditions tailored to specific needs.</description>

      <title>ExAMPC: the Data-Driven Explainable and Approximate NMPC with Physical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst the surge in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for control purposes, classical and model-based control methods maintain their popularity due to their transparency and deterministic nature. However, advanced controllers like Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), despite proven capabilities, face adoption challenges due to their computational complexity and unpredictable closed-loop performance in complex validation systems. This paper introduces ExAMPC, a methodology bridging classical control and explainable AI by augmenting the NMPC with data-driven insights to improve the trustworthiness and reveal the optimization solution and closed-loop performance's sensitivities to physical variables and system parameters. By employing a low-order spline embedding to reduce the open-loop trajectory dimensionality by over 95%, and integrating it with SHAP and Symbolic Regression from eXplainable AI (XAI) for an approximate NMPC, we enable intuitive physical insights into the NMPC's optimization routine. The prediction accuracy of the approximate NMPC is enhanced through physics-inspired continuous-time constraints penalties, reducing the predicted continuous trajectory violations by 93%. ExAMPC enables accurate forecasting of the NMPC's computational requirements with explainable insights on worst-case scenarios. Experimental validation on automated valet parking and autonomous racing with lap-time optimization NMPC, demonstrates the methodology's practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Learning for Feasible Region on Coal Mine Virtual Power Plants with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feasible region assessment (FRA) in industrial virtual power plants (VPPs) is driven by the need to activate large-scale latent industrial loads for demand response, making it essential to aggregate these flexible resources for peak regulation. However, the large number of devices and the need for privacy preservation in coal mines pose challenges to accurately aggregating these resources into a cohesive coal mine VPP. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable data-driven approach for FRA in the coal mine VPP that can manage incomplete information. Our data-driven FRA algorithm approximates equipment and FRA parameters based on historical energy dispatch data, effectively addressing the challenges of imperfect information. Simulation results illustrate that our method approximates the accurate feasible operational boundaries under dynamic and imperfect information conditions.</description>

      <title>Extended Impedance Modal Analysis of Internal Dynamics in Grid-Following Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the penetration of Grid-Following inverters (GFL) in power systems continues to increase, the dynamic characteristics of power systems undergo significant transformations. Recently, modal analysis based on the impedance model (MAI) has been utilized to evaluate the interaction between GFLs and the power grid through impedance/admittance participation factors (PF). However, MAI relies on the impedance model that characterizes the input-output behavior of the ports, treating the GFL as a single integrated entity. This approach limits its ability to reveal the complex dynamic coupling mechanism between different control loops inside the GFL. In this paper, we propose an extended impedance modal analysis (EMAI) method. Firstly, the equivalent dynamics of the GFL are decomposed into two components: the synchronous dynamic dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL) and the electromagnetic dynamic dominated by the current control loop (CCL). The PF and participation ratios (PR) of these two dynamic components are then calculated to identify the dominant dynamics of the system. Building on this, we introduce the explicit parameter participation factors (PPF) to further pinpoint the key parameters of the dominant control loop, which provides a way for enhancing system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation of the modified 14-bus and 68-bus systems. The EMAI method enables the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of each control loop in the GFL based on the impedance model. It can effectively identify the critical control loops influencing system stability without requiring the construction of a full state-space model, demonstrating its broad applicability and value.</description>

      <title>A Fully Self-Synchronized Control for Hybrid Series-Parallel Electronized Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid series-parallel system is the final form of the power electronics-enabled power system, which combines the advantages of both series and parallel connections. Although self-synchronization of parallel-type and series-type systems is well known, self-synchronization of hybrid systems remains unrevealed. To fill in this gap, a fully self-synchronized control for hybrid series-parallel system is proposed in this paper. Based on the self-synchronization mechanism of power angle in parallel-type system and power factor angle in series-type system, a decentralized control strategy by integration of power droop and power factor angle droop can realize self-synchronization and power balancing of each module in the hybrid system.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning Framework for Quality Assurance in Extrusion Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in extrusion additive manufacturing remain common despite its prevalent use. While numerous AI-driven approaches have been proposed to improve quality assurance, the inherently dynamic nature of the printing process poses persistent challenges. Regardless of how comprehensive the training dataset is, out-of-distribution data remains inevitable. Consequently, deterministic models often struggle to maintain robustness and, in some cases, fail entirely when deployed in new or slightly altered printing environments. This work introduces an agent that dynamically adjusts flow rate and temperature setpoints in real time, optimizing process control while addressing bottlenecks in training efficiency and uncertainty management. It integrates a vision-based uncertainty quantification module with a reinforcement learning controller, using probabilistic distributions to describe printing segments. While the underlying networks are deterministic, these evolving distributions introduce adaptability into the decision-making process. The vision system classifies material extrusion with a certain level of precision, generating corresponding distributions. A deep Q-learning controller interacts with a simulated environment calibrated to the vision system precision, allowing the agent to learn optimal actions while demonstrating appropriate hesitation when necessary. By executing asynchronous actions and applying progressively tightened elliptical reward shaping, the controller develops robust, adaptive control strategies that account for the coupling effects between process parameters. When deployed with zero-shot learning, the agent effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, correcting mild and severe under- and over-extrusion reliably. Beyond extrusion additive manufacturing, this scalable framework enables practical AI-driven quality assurance across various additive manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Real-World Deployment and Assessment of a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Variable Speed Limit Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first field deployment of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based variable speed limit (VSL) control system on Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee. We design and demonstrate a full pipeline from training MARL agents in a traffic simulator to a field deployment on a 17-mile segment of I-24 encompassing 67 VSL controllers. The system was launched on March 8th, 2024, and has made approximately 35 million decisions on 28 million trips in six months of operation. We apply an invalid action masking mechanism and several safety guards to ensure real-world constraints. The MARL-based implementation operates up to 98% of the time, with the safety guards overriding the MARL decisions for the remaining time. We evaluate the performance of the MARL-based algorithm in comparison to a previously deployed non-RL VSL benchmark algorithm on I-24. Results show that the MARL-based VSL control system achieves a superior performance. The accuracy of correctly warning drivers about slowing traffic ahead is improved by 14% and the response delay to non-recurrent congestion is reduced by 75%. The preliminary data shows that the VSL control system has reduced the crash rate by 26% and the secondary crash rate by 50%. We open-sourced the deployed MARL-based VSL algorithm at https://github.com/Lab-Work/marl-vsl-controller.</description>

      <title>Unified Power Flow Model for Bipolar HVDC Grids in Unbalanced Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near future, point-to-point High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems are expected to evolve into multi-terminal and meshed HVDC grids, predominantly adopting a bipolar HVDC configuration. Normally, bipolar HVDC systems operate in balanced mode, i.e., near zero current flows through metallic or ground return. However, bipolar HVDC systems can also be operated in an unbalanced mode in case of a single converter pole or line conductor outage. A steady-state analysis of the unbalanced DC network requires solving a power flow problem including various converter control modes, as the steady-state behavior of the converters is governed by their control modes. This paper presents a comprehensive and unified power flow model for the balanced and unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids, including various converter control modes on the AC and DC sides of the converter, in a hybrid AC/DC system. It extends the basic control modes, developed for monopolar HVDC grids, to support the balanced as well as unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids. Additionally, an AC-droop control, which defines a droop relationship between voltage magnitude and reactive power at the AC side of the converter, is incorporated into the modeling of bipolar HVDC systems. The functionality of the proposed model is demonstrated through a test case, and the power flow results are validated using PSCAD simulations. The impact of converter control modes on post-contingency system states is also investigated for single-pole contingencies. The proposed model is implemented as an open-source tool in the Julia/JuMP framework, where larger test cases demonstrate the robustness of the model and tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous systems are being developed in multiple industries it has been recognized that a phased approach is needed both for technical development and user acceptance. Partially in response, the automotive and aircraft industries have published five or six Levels of Autonomy in an attempt to broadly characterize the amount of autonomy technology that is present in any particular vehicle. We propose six Spacecraft Autonomy Levels to characterize and describe the high-level autonomous capabilities for any given satellite. Our proposed spacecraft autonomy levels parallel those of the automotive and aircraft levels in an attempt to maintain consistency and a common understanding. We see these autonomy levels as useful in education and communication with lawmakers, government officials, and the general public.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Dynamics and Network Control of a Single Articulated Robotic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01101v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research on graph-based dynamics and control of multi-agent systems has successfully demonstrated control of robotic swarms, where each robot is perceived as an independent agent virtually connected by a network topology. The strong advantage of the network control structure lies in the decentralized nature of the control action, which only requires the knowledge of virtually connected agents. In this paper, we seek to expand the ideas of virtual network constraints to physical constraints on a class of tree-structured robots which we denote as single articulated robotic (SAR) systems. In our proposed framework, each link can be viewed as an agent, and each holonomic constraint connecting links serves as an edge. By following the first principles of Lagrangian dynamics, we derive a consensus-like matrix-differential equation with weighted graph and edge Laplacians for the dynamics of a SAR system. The sufficient condition for the holonomic constraint forces becoming independent to the control inputs is derived. This condition leads to a decentralized leader-follower network control framework for regulating the relative configuration of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Aware Statistical Analysis of Peak AoI for Ground and Aerial Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to analyze the impact of user velocity on the distribution of the peak age-of-information (PAoI) for both ground and aerial users by using the dominant interferer-based approximation. We first approximate the SINR meta distribution for the uplink transmission using the distances between the serving base station (BS) and each of the user of interest and the dominant interfering user, which is the interferer that provides the strongest average received power at the tagged BS. We then analyze the spatio-temporal correlation coefficient of the conditional success probability by studying the correlation between the aforementioned two distances. Finally, we choose PAoI as a performance metric to showcase how spatio-temporal correlation or user velocity affect system performance. Our results reveal that ground users exhibit higher spatio-temporal correlations compared to aerial users, resulting in a more pronounced impact of velocity on system performance, such as joint probability of the conditional success probability and distribution of PAoI. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the dominant interferer-based approximation for the SINR meta distribution delivers good matching performance in complex scenarios, such as Nakagami-m fading model, and it can also be effectively utilized in computing spatio-temporal correlation, as this approximation is derived from the distances to the serving BS and the dominant interferer.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis and Intervention Strategies on a Coupled SIS Epidemic Model with Polar Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spread of infectious diseases within a networked community by integrating epidemic transmission and public opinion dynamics. We propose a novel discrete-time networked SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) epidemic model coupled with opinion dynamics that includes stubborn agents with biased views. The model captures the interplay between perceived and actual epidemic severity, offering insights into epidemic dynamics in socially interconnected environments. We introduce the SIS-opinion reproduction number to assess epidemic severity and analyze conditions for disease eradication and the global stability of endemic equilibria. Additionally, we explore opinion-based intervention strategies, providing a framework for policymakers to design effective prevention measures. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings and the model's practical implications.</description>

      <title>ecg2o: A Seamless Extension of g2o for Equality-Constrained Factor Graph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor graph optimization serves as a fundamental framework for robotic perception, enabling applications such as pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure-from-motion (SfM), and situational awareness. Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization. This library, along with demonstrative examples and the optimal control problem, is available as open source at https://github.com/snt-arg/ecg2o</description>

      <title>Local Rational Modeling for Identification Beyond the Nyquist Frequency: Applied to a Prototype Wafer Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-rate models are essential for control design, specifically to address intersample behavior. The aim of this paper is to develop a frequency-domain non-parametric identification technique to estimate fast-rate models of systems that have relevant dynamics and allow for actuation above the Nyquist frequency of a slow-rate output. Examples of such systems include vision-in-the-loop systems. Through local rational models over multiple frequency bands, aliased components are effectively disentangled, particularly for lightly-damped systems. The developed technique accurately determines non-parametric fast-rate models of systems with slow-rate outputs, all within a single identification experiment. Finally, the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through experiments conducted on a prototype wafer stage used for semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Costs using Deterministic Path Integral Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating the intended behavior of a dynamic system can be challenging. Signal temporal logic (STL) is frequently used for this purpose due to its suitability in formalizing comprehensible, modular, and versatile spatiotemporal specifications. Due to scaling issues with respect to the complexity of the specifications and the potential occurrence of non-differentiable terms, classical optimization methods often solve STL-based problems inefficiently. Smoothing and approximation techniques can alleviate these issues but require changing the optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel sampling-based method based on model predictive path integral control to solve optimal control problems with STL cost functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark motion planning problems and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method efficiently solves optimal control problems with STL costs.</description>

      <title>Patterning Silver Nanowire Network via the Gibbs-Thomson Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transparent electrodes, patterned silver nanowire (AgNW) networks suffer from noticeable pattern visibility, which is an unsettled issue for practical applications such as display. Here, we introduce a Gibbs-Thomson effect (GTE)-based patterning method to effectively reduce pattern visibility. Unlike conventional top-down and bottom-up strategies that rely on selective etching, removal, or deposition of AgNWs, our approach focuses on fragmenting nanowires primarily at the junctions through the GTE. This is realized by modifying AgNWs with a compound of diphenyliodonium nitrate and silver nitrate, which aggregates into nanoparticles at the junctions of AgNWs. These nanoparticles can boost the fragmentation of nanowires at the junctions under an ultralow temperature (75{\deg}C), allow pattern transfer through a photolithographic masking operation, and enhance plasmonic welding during UV exposure. The resultant patterned electrodes have trivial differences in transmittance ({\Delta}T = 1.4%) and haze ({\Delta}H = 0.3%) between conductive and insulative regions, with high-resolution patterning size down to 10 {\mu}m. To demonstrate the practicality of this novel method, we constructed a highly transparent, optoelectrical interactive tactile e-skin using the patterned AgNW electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a long-term dispatch framework for coupled hydropower and floating photovoltaic systems. We introduce a temporal decomposition algorithm based on partial Lagrangian relaxation to address long-term water contract constraints. We derive a real-time, non-anticipatory dispatch policy based on water contract pricing. Our framework is evaluated with a case study using real-world hydrology and power system data from Lake Mead and Lake Powell, on the Colorado River, demonstrating competitive performance against commercial solvers for both linearized and nonlinear reservoir models. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on transmission capacity, electricity price and uncertainty scenarios, showing that the operational performance is significantly impacted by the transmission capacity and electricity prices while remaining relatively robust under uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Inspection in a Terrestrial Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and deployment of autonomous systems for space missions require robust solutions to navigate strict reliability constraints, extended operational duration, and communication challenges. This study evaluates the stability and performance of a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed for multi-agent satellite inspection tasks. The proposed framework integrates a high-level guidance policy with a low-level motion controller, enabling scalable task allocation and efficient trajectory execution. Experiments conducted on the Local Intelligent Network of Collaborative Satellites (LINCS) testbed assess the framework's performance under varying levels of fidelity, from simulated environments to a cyber-physical testbed. Key metrics, including task completion rate, distance traveled, and fuel consumption, highlight the framework's robustness and adaptability despite real-world uncertainties such as sensor noise, dynamic perturbations, and runtime assurance (RTA) constraints. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical controller effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, maintaining high task completion rates while adapting to the complexities of real-world environments. These findings validate the framework's potential for enabling autonomous satellite operations in future space missions.</description>

      <title>Data Taxonomy Towards the Applicability of the Digital Twin Conceptual Framework in Disaster Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Digital Twin (DT) offers a novel approach to the management of critical infrastructures, including energy, water, traffic, public health, and communication systems, which are indispensable for the functioning of modern societies. The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of these infrastructures necessitate the development of robust disaster response and management strategies. During crises and disasters, data source availability for critical infrastructure may be severely constrained due to physical damage to communication networks, power outages, overwhelmed systems, sensor failure or intentional disruptions, hampering the ability to effectively monitor, manage, and respond to emergencies. This research introduces a taxonomy and similarity function for comparing data sources based on their features and vulnerability to crisis events. This assessment enables the identification of similar, complementary, and alternative data sources and rapid adaptation when primary sources fail. The paper outlines a data source manager as an additional component for existing DT frameworks, specifically the data ingress and scenario mangement. A case study for traffic data sources in an urban scenario demonstrates the proposed methodology and its effectiveness. This approach enhances the robustness and adaptability of DTs in disaster management applications, contributing to improved decision-making and response capabilities in critical situations.</description>

      <title>ProDapt: Proprioceptive Adaptation using Long-term Memory Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized imitation learning, allowing robots to replicate complex behaviours. However, diffusion often relies on cameras and other exteroceptive sensors to observe the environment and lacks long-term memory. In space, military, and underwater applications, robots must be highly robust to failures in exteroceptive sensors, operating using only proprioceptive information. In this paper, we propose ProDapt, a method of incorporating long-term memory of previous contacts between the robot and the environment in the diffusion process, allowing it to complete tasks using only proprioceptive data. This is achieved by identifying "keypoints", essential past observations maintained as inputs to the policy. We test our approach using a UR10e robotic arm in both simulation and real experiments and demonstrate the necessity of this long-term memory for task completion.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control Laws for Higher-Dimensional PDEs: Spatial Invariance and Domain Extension Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends backstepping to higher-dimensional PDEs by leveraging domain symmetries and structural properties. We systematically address three increasingly complex scenarios. First, for rectangular domains, we characterize boundary stabilization with finite-dimensional actuation by combining backstepping with Fourier analysis, deriving explicit necessary conditions. Second, for reaction-diffusion equations on sector domains, we use angular eigenfunction expansions to obtain kernel solutions in terms of modified Bessel functions. Finally, we outline a domain extension method for irregular domains, transforming the boundary control problem into an equivalent one on a target domain. This framework unifies and extends previous backstepping results, offering new tools for higher-dimensional domains where classical separation of variables is inapplicable.</description>

      <title>QaSAL: QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithms for Coexistence of 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for wireless connectivity, ensuring the efficient coexistence of multiple radio access technologies in shared unlicensed spectrum has become an important issue. This paper focuses on optimizing Medium Access Control (MAC) parameters to enhance the coexistence of 5G New Radio in Unlicensed Spectrum (NR-U) and Wi-Fi networks operating in unlicensed spectrum with multiple priority classes of traffic that may have varying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this context, we tackle the coexistence parameter management problem by introducing a QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable (QaSAL) framework, designed to improve network performance under various traffic conditions. Our approach augments the state representation with constraint information, enabling dynamic policy adjustments to enforce QoS requirements effectively. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of QaSAL in managing NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence, demonstrating improved channel access fairness while satisfying a latency constraint for high-priority traffic.</description>

      <title>Feasible Force Set Shaping for a Payload-Carrying Platform Consisting of Tiltable Multiple UAVs Connected Via Passive Hinge Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for shaping the feasible force set of a payload-carrying platform composed of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and proposes a control law that leverages the advantages of this shaped force set. The UAVs are connected to the payload through passively rotatable hinge joints. The joint angles are controlled by the differential thrust produced by the rotors, while the total force generated by all the rotors is responsible for controlling the payload. The shape of the set of the total force depends on the tilt angles of the UAVs, which allows us to shape the feasible force set by adjusting these tilt angles. This paper aims to ensure that the feasible force set encompasses the required shape, enabling the platform to generate force redundantly -meaning in various directions. We then propose a control law that takes advantage of this redundancy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energy-based learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function, for any step size, giving a guarantee of convergence for the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed Bayesian optimization method for rapid development of electrical machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced slot and winding designs are imperative to create future high performance electrical machines (EM). As a result, the development of methods to design and improve slot filling factor (SFF) has attracted considerable research. Recent developments in manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing and alternative materials, has also highlighted a need for novel high-fidelity design techniques to develop high performance complex geometries and topologies. This study therefore introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PIML) design optimization process for improving SFF in traction electrical machines used in electric vehicles. A maximum entropy sampling algorithm (MESA) is used to seed a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) algorithm, where the target function and its approximations are produced by Gaussian processes (GP)s. The proposed PIBO-MESA is coupled with a 2D finite element model (FEM) to perform a GP-based surrogate and provide the first demonstration of the optimal combination of complex design variables for an electrical machine. Significant computational gains were achieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing stochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and keystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic improvements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity. The newly developed PIBO-MESA design optimization process therefore presents significant benefits in the design of high-performance electric machines, with reduced development time and costs.</description>

      <title>Bring Your Own Grasp Generator: Leveraging Robot Grasp Generation for Prosthetic Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important research challenges in upper-limb prosthetics is enhancing the user-prosthesis communication to closely resemble the experience of a natural limb. As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience. Code and demo videos are available online at https://hsp-iit.github.io/byogg/.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) offer a promising solution for automating fishnet inspection, reducing labor dependency, and improving operational efficiency. In this paper, we modify an off-the-shelf ROV, the BlueROV2, into a ROS-based framework and develop a localization module, a path planning system, and a control framework. For real-time, local localization, we employ the open-source TagSLAM library. Additionally, we propose a control strategy based on a Nominal Feedback Controller (NFC) to achieve precise trajectory tracking. The proposed system has been implemented and validated through experiments in a controlled laboratory environment, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of `model' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of `interpretation', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an experimental setup to evaluate the performance of a radio frequency identification (RFID)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. We focus on both the communication and sensing capabilities of the system. Our experiments evaluate the system's performance in various channel fading scenarios and with different substrate materials, including wood, plastic, wall, and glass. Additionally, we utilize radio tomographic imaging (RTI) to detect human motion by analyzing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data. Our results demonstrate the impact of different materials and environments on RSSI and highlight the potential of RFID-based systems for effective sensing and communication in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>ATMO: An Aerially Transforming Morphobot for Dynamic Ground-Aerial Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing ground-aerial robots is challenging due to the increased actuation requirements which can lead to added weight and reduced locomotion efficiency. Morphobots mitigate this by combining actuators into multi-functional groups and leveraging ground transformation to achieve different locomotion modes. However, transforming on the ground requires dealing with the complexity of ground-vehicle interactions during morphing, limiting applicability on rough terrain. Mid-air transformation offers a solution to this issue but demands operating near or beyond actuator limits while managing complex aerodynamic forces. We address this problem by introducing the Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), a robot which transforms near the ground achieving smooth transition between aerial and ground modes. To achieve this, we leverage the near ground aerodynamics, uncovered by experimental load cell testing, and stabilize the system using a model-predictive controller that adapts to ground proximity and body shape. The system is validated through numerous experimental demonstrations. We find that ATMO can land smoothly at body postures past its actuator saturation limits by virtue of the uncovered ground-effect.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the safety-critical control of robotic manipulators operating in dynamic environments. Building upon the framework of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we extend the collision cone methodology to formulate Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BFs) specifically tailored for manipulators. In our approach, safety constraints derived from collision cone geometry are seamlessly integrated with Cartesian impedance control to ensure compliant yet safe end-effector behavior. A Quadratic Program (QP)-based controller is developed to minimally modify the nominal control input to enforce safety. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in various dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Automata of PLCs in Production Lines Using LSTM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Production Lines and Conveying Systems are the staple of modern manufacturing processes. Manufacturing efficiency is directly related to the efficiency of the means of production and conveying. Modelling in the industrial context has always been a challenge due to the complexity that comes along with modern manufacturing standards. Long Short-Term Memory is a pattern recognition Recurrent Neural Network, that is utilised on a simple pneumatic conveying system which transports a wooden block around the system. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture temporal dependencies through feedback loops, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks enhance this capability by using gated mechanisms to effectively learn long-term dependencies. Conveying systems, representing a major component of production lines, are chosen as the target to model to present an approach applicable in large scale production lines in a simpler format. In this paper data from sensors are used to train the LSTM in order to output an Automaton that models the conveying system. The automaton obtained from the proposed LSTM approach is compared with the automaton obtained from OTALA. The resultant LSTM automaton proves to be a more accurate representation of the conveying system, unlike the one obtained from OTALA.</description>

      <title>TRACE: A Self-Improving Framework for Robot Behavior Forecasting with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the near-term behavior of a reactive agent is crucial in many robotic scenarios, yet remains challenging when observations of that agent are sparse or intermittent. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising avenue by integrating textual domain knowledge with visual cues, but their one-shot predictions often miss important edge cases and unusual maneuvers. Our key insight is that iterative, counterfactual exploration--where a dedicated module probes each proposed behavior hypothesis, explicitly represented as a plausible trajectory, for overlooked possibilities--can significantly enhance VLM-based behavioral forecasting. We present TRACE (Tree-of-thought Reasoning And Counterfactual Exploration), an inference framework that couples tree-of-thought generation with domain-aware feedback to refine behavior hypotheses over multiple rounds. Concretely, a VLM first proposes candidate trajectories for the agent; a counterfactual critic then suggests edge-case variations consistent with partial observations, prompting the VLM to expand or adjust its hypotheses in the next iteration. This creates a self-improving cycle where the VLM progressively internalizes edge cases from previous rounds, systematically uncovering not only typical behaviors but also rare or borderline maneuvers, ultimately yielding more robust trajectory predictions from minimal sensor data. We validate TRACE on both ground-vehicle simulations and real-world marine autonomous surface vehicles. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms standard VLM-driven and purely model-based baselines, capturing a broader range of feasible agent behaviors despite sparse sensing. Evaluation videos and code are available at trace-robotics.github.io.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Network Security Management in Water Systems using FM-based Attack Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water systems are vital components of modern infrastructure, yet they are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber attacks with potentially dire consequences on public health and safety. While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques effectively detect anomalies, contemporary model-agnostic attack attribution methods using LIME, SHAP, and LEMNA are deemed impractical for large-scale, interdependent water systems. This is due to the intricate interconnectivity and dynamic interactions that define these complex environments. Such methods primarily emphasize individual feature importance while falling short of addressing the crucial sensor-actuator interactions in water systems, which limits their effectiveness in identifying root cause attacks. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Factorization Machines (FM)-based approach that capitalizes on water system sensor-actuator interactions to provide granular explanations and attributions for cyber attacks. For instance, an anomaly in an actuator pump activity can be attributed to a top root cause attack candidates, a list of water pressure sensors, which is derived from the underlying linear and quadratic effects captured by our approach. We validate our method using two real-world water system specific datasets, SWaT and WADI, demonstrating its superior performance over traditional attribution methods. In multi-feature cyber attack scenarios involving intricate sensor-actuator interactions, our FM-based attack attribution method effectively ranks attack root causes, achieving approximately 20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of a Locomotion Interface for Virtual Reality Lower-Body Haptic Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the design, build, control, and preliminary user data of a locomotion interface called ForceBot. It delivers lower-body haptic interaction in virtual reality (VR), enabling users to walk in VR while interacting with various simulated terrains. It utilizes two planar gantries to give each foot two degrees of freedom and passive heel-lifting motion. The design used motion capture data with dynamic simulation for ergonomic human-robot workspace and hardware selection. Its system framework uses open-source robotic software and pairs with a custom-built power delivery system that offers EtherCAT communication with a 1,000 Hz soft real-time computation rate. This system features an admittance controller to regulate physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) alongside a walking algorithm to generate walking motion and simulate virtual terrains. The system's performance is explored through three measurements that evaluate the relationship between user input force and output pHRI motion. Overall, this platform presents a unique approach by utilizing planar gantries to realize VR terrain interaction with an extensive workspace, reasonably compact footprint, and preliminary user data.</description>

      <title>Stone Soup Multi-Target Tracking Feature Extraction For Autonomous Search And Track In Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Management of sensing resources is a non-trivial problem for future military air assets with future systems deploying heterogeneous sensors to generate information of the battlespace. Machine learning techniques including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been identified as promising approaches, but require high-fidelity training environments and feature extractors to generate information for the agent. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning training approach, utilising the Stone Soup tracking framework as a feature extractor to train an agent for a sensor management task. A general framework for embedding Stone Soup tracker components within a Gymnasium environment is presented, enabling fast and configurable tracker deployments for RL training using Stable Baselines3. The approach is demonstrated in a sensor management task where an agent is trained to search and track a region of airspace utilising track lists generated from Stone Soup trackers. A sample implementation using three neural network architectures in a search-and-track scenario demonstrates the approach and shows that RL agents can outperform simple sensor search and track policies when trained within the Gymnasium and Stone Soup environment.</description>

      <title>Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process in- and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors that influence the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Carleman-Fourier linearization for analyzing nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic vector fields characterized by multiple fundamental frequencies. Using Fourier basis functions, this novel framework transforms such dynamical systems into equivalent infinite-dimensional linear dynamical systems. In this work, we establish the exponential convergence of the primary block in the finite-section approximation of this linearized system to the state vector of the original nonlinear system. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Kuramoto model, a prominent model for coupled oscillators. The results demonstrate promising accuracy in approximating the original system's behavior.</description>

      <title>m4: A Learned Flow-level Network Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-level simulation is widely used to model large-scale data center networks due to its scalability. Unlike packet-level simulators that model individual packets, flow-level simulators abstract traffic as continuous flows with dynamically assigned transmission rates. While this abstraction enables orders-of-magnitude speedup, it is inaccurate by omitting critical packet-level effects such as queuing, congestion control, and retransmissions.
  We present m4, an accurate and scalable flow-level simulator that uses machine learning to learn the dynamics of the network of interest. At the core of m4 lies a novel ML architecture that decomposes state transition computations into distinct spatial and temporal components, each represented by a suitable neural network. To efficiently learn the underlying flow-level dynamics, m4 adds dense supervision signals by predicting intermediate network metrics such as remaining flow size and queue length during training. m4 achieves a speedup of up to 104$\times$ over packet-level simulation. Relative to a traditional flow-level simulation, m4 reduces per-flow estimation errors by 45.3% (mean) and 53.0% (p90). For closed-loop applications, m4 accurately predicts network throughput under various congestion control schemes and workloads.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cra\'mer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.</description>

Abstract: We propose an efficient symbolic control synthesis algorithm for equivariant continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy reach-avoid specifications. The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds another layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman (composition) operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. As a consequence, our proposed framework allows for arbitrary accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal verification techniques play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of complex cyber-physical systems. To transfer model-based verification results to the real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in the set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to as reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those reachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant identification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these methods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output models. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of prior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of model uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model uncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box models from data. The robustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Modeling Errors on Distributed Continuous-time Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Controller for Parallel DC-DC Converters with ZIP Load and Constrained Output Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear controller is designed for a parallel DC-DC converter system that feeds an unknown ZIP load, characterized by constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P), at the DC bus. The proposed controller ensures simultaneous voltage adjustment and power sharing in the large signal sense despite uncertainties in ZIP loads, DC input voltages, and other electrical parameters. To keep the output voltage within a desired range, we utilize a barrier function that is invertible, smoothly continuous, and strictly increasing. Its limits at infinity represent the upper and lower bounds for the output voltage. We apply the invertible transformation of the barrier function to the output voltage and then design the controller using the adaptive backstepping method. Using this barrier-function-based adaptive backstepping controller, uncertain parameters are identified on-line, and the voltage adjustment and power sharing objectives are established. Moreover, voltage constraint is not violated event in the presence of sudden and unknown large variations of load. The efficiency of the proposed nonlinear controller is evaluated through simulations of a parallel DC-DC converter system using the MATLAB/Simscape Electrical environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.</description>

      <title>Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Data-Driven Ship Dynamics Model: Enhancing Physics-Based Motion Prediction with Parameter Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous navigation systems on ships necessitates accurate motion prediction models tailored to individual vessels. Traditional physics-based models, while grounded in hydrodynamic principles, often fail to account for ship-specific behaviors under real-world conditions. Conversely, purely data-driven models offer specificity but lack interpretability and robustness in edge cases. This study proposes a data-driven physics-based model that integrates physics-based equations with data-driven parameter optimization, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to ensure interpretability and adaptability. The model incorporates physics-based components such as 3-DoF dynamics, rudder, and propeller forces, while parameters such as resistance curve and rudder coefficients are optimized using synthetic data. By embedding domain knowledge into the parameter optimization process, the fitted model maintains physical consistency. Validation of the approach is realized with two container ships by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, predictions against ground-truth trajectories. The results demonstrate significant improvements, in predictive accuracy and reliability, of the data-driven physics-based models over baseline physics-based models tuned with traditional marine engineering practices. The fitted models capture ship-specific behaviors in diverse conditions with their predictions being, 51.6% (ship A) and 57.8% (ship B) more accurate, 72.36% (ship A) and 89.67% (ship B) more consistent.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of states through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - in a state space which forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated state. The so-called group-affine property of the state evolution is shown to be necessary and sufficient for linearity of the dynamics on the associated Lie algebra, in turn implying CGs are invariant under such evolution. A putative SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, numerical experiments demonstrate that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.</description>

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</description>

      <title>Robust Stability of Neural Network Control Systems with Interval Matrix Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in controller design due to their versatility and efficiency. However, their integration into feedback systems can pose stability challenges, particularly in the presence of uncertainties. This work addresses the problem of certifying robust stability in neural network control systems with interval matrix uncertainties. Leveraging classical robust stability techniques and the quadratic constraint-based method to characterize the input-output behavior of neural networks, we derive novel robust stability certificates formulated as linear matrix inequalities. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce three relaxed sufficient conditions and establish their equivalence in terms of feasibility. Additionally, we explore their connections to existing robust stability results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through inverted pendulum and mass-spring-damper examples.</description>

      <title>Offline Learning of Decision Functions in Multiplayer Games with Expectation Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of stochastic multiplayer games where each player in the game aims to optimize its objective under uncertainty and adheres to some expectation constraints. The study employs an offline learning paradigm, leveraging a pre-existing dataset containing auxiliary features. While prior research in deterministic and stochastic multiplayer games primarily explored vector-valued decisions, this work departs by considering function-valued decisions that incorporate auxiliary features as input. We leverage the law of large deviations and degree theory to establish the almost sure convergence of the offline learning solution to the true solution as the number of data samples increases. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our method via a multi-account portfolio optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pseudo-spectral method for Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) that allows for tight polynomial bounds to be achieved via flexible sub-intervals. The proposed method not only rigorously enforces inequality constraints, but also allows for a lower cost in comparison with non-flexible discretizations. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method to solve optimal control problems. Solutions to the example problems exhibited up to a tenfold reduction in relative cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive incentive mechanism that learns the optimal incentives in environments where players continuously update their strategies. Our mechanism updates incentives based on each player's externality, defined as the difference between the player's marginal cost and the operator's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the players' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by players to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which the adaptive mechanism converges to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant classes of games: atomic aggregative games and non-atomic routing games.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient RL under Linear Bellman Completeness for Deterministic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computationally and statistically efficient Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the linear Bellman Complete setting. This setting uses linear function approximation to capture value functions and unifies existing models like linear Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While it is known from the prior works that this setting is statistically tractable, it remained open whether a computationally efficient algorithm exists. Our work provides a computationally efficient algorithm for the linear Bellman complete setting that works for MDPs with large action spaces, random initial states, and random rewards but relies on the underlying dynamics to be deterministic. Our approach is based on randomization: we inject random noise into least squares regression problems to perform optimistic value iteration. Our key technical contribution is to carefully design the noise to only act in the null space of the training data to ensure optimism while circumventing a subtle error amplification issue.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System Subject to External Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Robust Edge Network Hardening Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge. For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality. These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters. Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience. To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty. Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays. However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties. We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form. Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

      <title>Learning with Linear Function Approximations in Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems with finite state and action spaces where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reach-Avoid for Black-Box Systems through Narrow Gaps via Neural Network Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical reach-avoid problem, autonomous mobile robots are tasked to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. However, it is difficult to provide guarantees on the robot's performance when the obstacles form a narrow gap and the robot is a black-box (i.e. the dynamics are not known analytically, but interacting with the system is cheap). To address this challenge, this paper presents NeuralPARC. The method extends the authors' prior Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to systems modeled by rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks, which are trained to represent parameterized trajectory data demonstrated by the robot. NeuralPARC computes the reachable set of the network while accounting for modeling error, and returns a set of states and parameters with which the black-box system is guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles. NeuralPARC is shown to outperform PARC, generating provably-safe extreme vehicle drift parking maneuvers in simulations and in real life on a model car, as well as enabling safety on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to large disturbances and controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy.</description>

Abstract: We propose an adaptive method for online time-varying (TV) convex optimization, termed $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive optimization ($\mathcal{L}_{1}$-AO). TV optimizers utilize a prediction model to exploit the temporal structure of TV problems, which can be inaccurate in the online implementation. Inspired by $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive control, the proposed method augments an adaptive update law to estimate and compensate for the uncertainty from the prediction inaccuracies. The proposed method provides performance bounds of the error in the optimization variables and cost function, allowing efficient and reliable optimization for TV problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for online TV convex optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for path-parametric planning and control. This formulation is universal as it standardizes the entire spectrum of path-parametric techniques -- from traditional path following to more recent contouring or progress-maximizing Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning -- under a single framework. The ingredients underlying this universality are twofold: First, we present a compact and efficient technique capable of computing singularity-free, smooth and differentiable moving frames. Second, we derive a spatial path parameterization of the Cartesian coordinates for any arbitrary curve without prior assumptions on its parametric speed or moving frame, and that perfectly interplays with the aforementioned path parameterization method. The combination of these two ingredients leads to a planning and control framework that unites existing path-parametric techniques in literature.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of optimal ground station selection for low-Earth orbiting (LEO) space missions that enables mission operators to precisely design their ground segment performance and costs. Space mission operators are increasingly turning to Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers to supply the terrestrial communications segment to reduce costs and increase network size. However, this approach leads to a new challenge of selecting the optimal service providers and station locations for a given mission. We consider the problem of ground station selection as an optimization problem and present a general solution framework that allows mission designers to set their overall optimization objective and constrain key mission performance variables such as total data downlink, total mission cost, recurring operational cost, and maximum communications time-gap. We solve the problem using integer programming (IP). To address computational scaling challenges, we introduce a surrogate optimization approach where the optimal station selection is determined based on solving the problem over a reduced time domain. Two different IP formulations are evaluated using randomized selections of LEO satellites of varying constellation sizes. We consider the networks of the commercial GSaaS providers Atlas Space Operations, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, Azure Orbital Ground Station, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Leaf Space, and Viasat Real-Time Earth. We compare our results against standard operational practices of integrating with one or two primary ground station providers.</description>

      <title>Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Regulator Without Initial Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown parameters. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riemannian distance over the Riccati operator. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results, demonstrating the method's practical feasibility and performance in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.</description>
