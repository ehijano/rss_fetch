      <title>IntFold: A Controllable Foundation Model for General and Specialized Biomolecular Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IntFold, a controllable foundation model for both general and specialized biomolecular structure prediction. IntFold demonstrates predictive accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art AlphaFold3, while utilizing a superior customized attention kernel. Beyond standard structure prediction, IntFold can be adapted to predict allosteric states, constrained structures, and binding affinity through the use of individual adapters. Furthermore, we introduce a novel confidence head to estimate docking quality, offering a more nuanced assessment for challenging targets such as antibody-antigen complexes. Finally, we share insights gained during the training process of this computationally intensive model.</description>

      <title>Downregulation of aquaporin 3 promotes hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperosmolarity is a key contributor to nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) apoptosis during intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a membrane channel protein, regulates cellular osmotic balance by transporting water and osmolytes. Although AQP3 downregulation is associated with disc degeneration, its role in apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces AQP3 depletion, suppresses the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation in NPCs. Lentiviral overexpression of AQP3 restores this pathway, attenuates oxidative damage, and reduces apoptosis, preserving disc structure in IVDD rat models. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of AQP3 exacerbates ECM catabolism and NP tissue loss. Our findings reveal that AQP3 deficiency under hyperosmolarity contributes to NPC apoptosis via suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, potentially creating a pathological cycle of disc degeneration. These results highlight AQP3 as a promising therapeutic target for IVDD.</description>

      <title>HelixDesign-Antibody: A Scalable Production-Grade Platform for Antibody Design Built on HelixFold3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody engineering is essential for developing therapeutics and advancing biomedical research. Traditional discovery methods often rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental screening. To enhance and streamline this process, we introduce a production-grade, high-throughput platform built on HelixFold3, HelixDesign-Antibody, which utilizes the high-accuracy structure prediction model, HelixFold3. The platform facilitates the large-scale generation of antibody candidate sequences and evaluates their interaction with antigens. Integrated high-performance computing (HPC) support enables high-throughput screening, addressing challenges such as fragmented toolchains and high computational demands. Validation on multiple antigens showcases the platform's ability to generate diverse and high-quality antibodies, confirming a scaling law where exploring larger sequence spaces increases the likelihood of identifying optimal binders. This platform provides a seamless, accessible solution for large-scale antibody design and is available via the antibody design page of PaddleHelix platform.</description>

      <title>STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.</description>

      <title>An AI-native experimental laboratory for autonomous biomolecular engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration. Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for science-as-a-service at scale.</description>

      <title>Guided Generation for Developable Antibodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246 clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and biophysical criteria in tandem.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Across Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching. The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants, such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.</description>

      <title>Into the Unknown: From Structure to Disorder in Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) account for one-third of the human proteome and play essential biological roles. However, predicting the functions of IDRs remains a major challenge due to their lack of stable structures, rapid sequence evolution, and context-dependent behavior. Many predictors of protein function neglect or underperform on IDRs. Recent advances in computational biology and machine learning, including protein language models, alignment-free approaches, and IDR-specific methods, have revealed conserved bulk features and local motifs within IDRs that are linked to function. This review highlights emerging computational methods that map the sequence-function relationship in IDRs, outlines critical challenges in IDR function annotation, and proposes a community-driven framework to accelerate interpretable functional predictions for IDRs.</description>

      <title>From Sentences to Sequences: Rethinking Languages in Biological System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP) has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins, RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling. However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive paradigm in biological language modeling.
