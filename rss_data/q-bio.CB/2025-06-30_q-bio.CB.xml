      <title>Enhanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Response with Preserved Biocompatibility via (MnZn)Ferrite--Polyacrylonitrile Composite Nanofiber Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that their internal correlation time is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.</description>
