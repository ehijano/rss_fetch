      <title>Barycentric algebras -- convexity and order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the abstract of a series of lectures given during the XIIIth School on Geometry and Physics, Bialystok (Poland), in July 2024. In this minicourse, we first examine the algebraic aspects of barycentric algebras. Then, we focus on various examples and applications, reviewing the pertinence of the barycentric algebra structure.</description>

      <title>Rhizaform algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any anti-associative algebra gives rise to a Jacobi-Jordan algebra by [x, y] = xy + yx. This article aims to introduce the concept of "rhizaform algebras", which offer an approach to addressing anti-associativity. These algebras are defined by two operations whose sum is anti-associative, with the left and right multiplication operators forming bimodules of the sum of anti-associative algebras. This characterization parallels that of dendriform algebras, where the sum of operations preserves associativity. Additionally, the notions of O-operators and Rota-Baxter operators on anti-associative algebras are presented as tools to interpret rhizaform algebras. Notably, anti-associative algebras with nondegenerate Connes cocycles admit compatible rhizaform algebra structures.</description>

      <title>The large scale geometry of inverse semigroups and their maximal group images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of inverse semigroups is a natural topic of study, motivated both from within semigroup theory and by applications to the theory of non-commutative $C^*$-algebras. We study the relationship between the geometry of an inverse semigroup and that of its maximal group image, and in particular the geometric \textit{distortion} of the natural map from the former to the latter. This turns out to have both implications for semigroup theory and potential relevance for operator algebras associated to inverse semigroups. Along the way, we also answer a question of Lled\'{o} and Mart\'{i}nez by providing a more direct proof that an $E$-unitary inverse semigroup has Yu's Property A if its maximal group image does.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps and applications to preserver problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ let $\mathcal{X}_n$ be either the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices, the set $N_n$ of all $n \times n$ normal matrices, or any of the matrix Lie groups $\mathrm{GL}(n)$, $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$. We first give a short and elementary argument that for two positive integers $m$ and $n$ there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_m$ (i.e.\ $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(X))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$. Moreover, in that case we have the equality of characteristic polynomials $k_{\phi(X)}(\cdot) = k_{X}(\cdot)^\frac{m}{n}$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$, which in particular shows that $\phi$ preserves spectra. Using this we show that whenever $n \geq 3$, any continuous commutativity preserving and spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_n$ is of the form $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)T^{-1}$ or $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)^tT^{-1}$, for some $T\in \mathrm{GL}(n)$. The analogous results fail for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(n)$, and slightly more elaborate versions hold for the spaces of semisimple elements in either $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n)$, where a qualitatively new (and surprising) phenomenon arises: the map sending $SNS^{-1}$ to $S^{-1}NS$ for positive invertible $S$ and normal $N$ is also an example. As a consequence, we also recover (a strengthened version of) \v{S}emrl's influential characterization of Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ via preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional generalization of abelian categories via DG Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce abelian $(n,1)$-categories as an $n$-dimensional analog of abelian categories, where for \( n=1 \), it corresponds to ordinary abelian categories, and for \( n=\infty \), it represents stable DG-categories. We demonstrate that their homotopy categories become extriangulated categories and pretriangulated categories, and we establish a general theory of abelian $(n,1)$-categories. For example, the analog of the existance epi-mono factorizations of morphisms in abelian categories.</description>

      <title>Species of Rota-Baxter algebras by rooted trees, twisted bialgebras and Fock functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental and ubiquitous combinatorial notion, species has attracted sustained interest, generalizing from set-theoretical combinatorial to algebraic combinatorial and beyond. The Rota-Baxter algebra is one of the algebraic structures with broad applications from Renormalization of quantum field theory to integrable systems and multiple zeta values. Its interpretation in terms of monoidal categories has also recently appeared. This paper studies species of Rota-Baxter algebras, making use of the combinatorial construction of free Rota-Baxter algebras in terms of angularly decorated trees and forests. The notion of simple angularly decorated forests is introduced for this purpose and the resulting Rota-Baxter species is shown to be free. Furthermore, a twisted bialgebra structure, as the bialgebra for species, is established on this free Rota-Baxter species. Finally, through the Fock functor, another proof of the bialgebra structure on free Rota-Baxter algebras is obtained.</description>

      <title>Modules determined by their Newton polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $\tau$-tilting theory, there exist two classes of foundamental modules: indecomposable $\tau$-rigid modules and left finite bricks. In this paper, we prove the indecomposable $\tau$-rigid modules and the left finite bricks are uniquely determined by their Newton polytopes spanned by the dimensional vectors of their quotient modules. This is a kind of generalization of Gabriel's result that the indecomposable modules over path algebras of Dynkin quivers are uniquely determined by their dimensional vectors.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Multilinear Module Expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the deconstruction/reconstruction of extensions in varieties of algebras which are modules expanded by multilinear operators. The parametrization of extensions determined by abelian ideals with unary actions agrees with the previous development of extensions realizing affine datum in arbitrary varieties of universal algebras. We establish a Well's type theorem which, for a fixed affine ideal, characterizes those ideal-preserving derivations of a group-trivial extension as a Lie algebra extension of the compatible pairs of derivations of the datum algebras associated to the ideal by the cohomological derivations of the datum. For these varieties, we establish a low-dimensional Hochschild-Serre exact sequence associated to an arbitrary extension equipped with an additional affine action.</description>

      <title>Extensions realizing affine datum : the Wells derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Wells derivation for extensions realizing affine datum in arbitrary varieties; in particular, we show there is an exact sequence connecting the group of compatible automorphisms determined by the datum and the subgroup of automorphisms of an extension which preserves the extension's kernel. This implies a homomorphism between $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-cohomology groups which realizes a group of kernel-preserving automorphisms of an extension as itself an extension of a subgroup of compatible automorphisms by the group of derivations of the datum. A refinement of this general Wells's-type theorem is given for a restricted class of varieties with a difference term which include any variety of groups with multiple operators in the sense of Higgins. The same results are obtained for nonabelian extensions in any variety of $R$-modules expanded by multilinear operations.</description>

      <title>Permutation representations and automorphisms of evolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the natural permutation representation of highly transitive finite groups cannot be realized as the full automorphism group of an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution algebra acting on the set of lines spanned by its natural elements. Specifically, for any sufficiently large integer $n$ and $k \geq 4$, there does not exist an idempotent evolution algebra $X$ of dimension $n$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is isomorphic to a proper $k$-transitive subgroup of $S_n$.
  Nevertheless, we show that for any finite group $G$, any permutation representation $\xi \colon G \to S_n$, and any field $\Bbbk$, there exists an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution $\Bbbk$-algebra $X$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X) \cong G$, and the induced representation of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ on the natural idempotents of $X$ is equivalent to $\xi$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of zero sets of central quaternionic polynomials II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of the first and last authors [2], we further analyze the structure of a zero set of a left ideal in the ring of central polynomials over the quaternion algebra H. We describe the "algebraic hull" of a point in H^n and prove it is a product of spheres. Using this description we give a new proof to a conjecture of Gori, Sarfatti and Vlacci. We also show that the main result of [2] does not extend to general division algebras.</description>

      <title>F-invariant in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $F$-invariant in cluster algebras using tropicalization. This is an analog of the $E$-invariant introduced by Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky in the additive categorification of cluster algebras and the $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant introduced by Kang, Kashiwara, Kim and Oh in the monoidal categorification of (quantum) cluster algebras. We prove that the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero. For cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson bracket, we prove that if two cluster variables are log-cannonical, then they are contained in the same cluster.
  Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as an replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory and as an replacement of inversion sets in the study of right weak order on Weyl groups. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</description>
