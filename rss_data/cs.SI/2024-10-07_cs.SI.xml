      <title>An egonet-based approach to effective weighted network comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the impressive growth of network models in practically every scientific and technological area, we are often faced with the need to compare graphs, i.e., to quantify their (dis)similarity using appropriate metrics. This is necessary, for example, to identify networks with comparable characteristics or to spot anomalous instants in a time sequence of graphs. While a large number of metrics are available for binary networks, the set of comparison methods capable of handling weighted graphs is much smaller. Yet, the strength of connections is often a key ingredient of the model, and ignoring this information could lead to misleading results. In this paper we introduce a family of dissimilarity measures to compare undirected weighted networks. They fall into the class of alignment-free metrics: as such, they do not require the correspondence of the nodes between the two graphs and can also compare networks of different sizes. In short, they are based on the distributions, on the graph, of a few egonet features which are easily defined and computed: the distance between two graphs is then the distance between the corresponding distributions. On a properly defined testbed with a pool of weighted network models with diversified characteristics, the proposed metrics are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the model classification task. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed metrics are then demonstrated on two examples. In the first, some ''filtering'' schemes -- designed to eliminate non-significant links while maintaining most of the total weight -- are evaluated in their ability to produce as output a graph faithful to the original, in terms of the local structure around nodes. In the second example, analyzing a timeline of stock market correlation graphs highlights anomalies associated with periods of financial instability.</description>

      <title>Research Landscape of the novel emerging field of Cryptoeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bibliometric literature analysis was conducted to illuminate the evolving and rapidly expanding literature in the field of cryptoeconomics. This analysis presented the emerging field's intellectual, social, and conceptual structure. The intellectual structure, characterized by schools of thought, emerged through a common citation analysis. The social structure revealed collaborations among researchers, identified through a co-authorship analysis. Network analysis highlighted collaborative communities facilitating innovation and knowledge exchange within the field. The conceptual structure was enlightened by analyzing common terms occurring in titles, author keywords, abstracts, and the publication itself. This bibliometric analysis of the rapidly advancing field of cryptoeconomics serves as a foundational resource, providing insights into research productivity and emerging trends. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the field, offering valuable information on research patterns and trends. Furthermore, this analysis empowers researchers, policymakers, and industry sectors to make informed decisions, establish collaborations, and navigate the dynamic and evolving landscape of the cryptoeconomics field.</description>

      <title>Media Framing through the Lens of Event-Centric Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a communications perspective, a frame defines the packaging of the language used in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others. For example, a news article can frame immigration as either a boost or a drain on the economy, and thus communicate very different interpretations of the same phenomenon. In this work, we argue that to explain framing devices we have to look at the way narratives are constructed. As a first step in this direction, we propose a framework that extracts events and their relations to other events, and groups them into high-level narratives that help explain frames in news articles. We show that our framework can be used to analyze framing in U.S. news for two different domains: immigration and gun control.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Point-of-Interest Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03265v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are applied to recommendation tasks such as items to buy and news articles to read. Point of Interest is quite a new area to sequential recommendation based on language representations of multimodal datasets. As a first step to prove our concepts, we focused on restaurant recommendation based on each user's past visit history. When choosing a next restaurant to visit, a user would consider genre and location of the venue and, if available, pictures of dishes served there. We created a pseudo restaurant check-in history dataset from the Foursquare dataset and the FoodX-251 dataset by converting pictures into text descriptions with a multimodal model called LLaVA, and used a language-based sequential recommendation framework named Recformer proposed in 2023. A model trained on this semi-multimodal dataset has outperformed another model trained on the same dataset without picture descriptions. This suggests that this semi-multimodal model reflects actual human behaviours and that our path to a multimodal recommendation model is in the right direction.</description>

      <title>Five Years of COVID-19 Discourse on Instagram: A Labeled Instagram Dataset of Over Half a Million Posts for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</description>

      <title>Group Fairness in Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large conferences such as NeurIPS and AAAI serve as crossroads of various AI fields, since they attract submissions from a vast number of communities. However, in some cases, this has resulted in a poor reviewing experience for some communities, whose submissions get assigned to less qualified reviewers outside of their communities. An often-advocated solution is to break up any such large conference into smaller conferences, but this can lead to isolation of communities and harm interdisciplinary research. We tackle this challenge by introducing a notion of group fairness, called the core, which requires that every possible community (subset of researchers) to be treated in a way that prevents them from unilaterally benefiting by withdrawing from a large conference.
  We study a simple peer review model, prove that it always admits a reviewing assignment in the core, and design an efficient algorithm to find one such assignment. We use real data from CVPR and ICLR conferences to compare our algorithm to existing reviewing assignment algorithms on a number of metrics.</description>

      <title>The influence of coordinated behavior on toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the intricate landscape of social media, genuine content dissemination may be altered by a number of threats. Coordinated Behavior (CB), defined as orchestrated efforts by entities to deceive or mislead users about their identity and intentions, emerges as a tactic to exploit or manipulate online discourse. This study delves into the relationship between CB and toxic conversation on X (formerly known as Twitter). Using a dataset of 11 million tweets from 1 million users preceding the 2019 UK general election, we show that users displaying CB typically disseminate less harmful content, irrespective of political affiliation. However, distinct toxicity patterns emerge among different coordinated cohorts. Compared to their non-CB counterparts, CB participants show marginally higher toxicity levels only when considering their original posts. We further show the effects of CB-driven toxic content on non-CB users, gauging its impact based on political leanings. Our findings suggest that CB only has a limited impact on the toxicity of digital discourse.</description>

      <title>Insights and caveats from mining local and global temporal motifs in cryptocurrency transaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed ledger technologies have opened up a wealth of fine-grained transaction data from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This allows research into problems like anomaly detection, anti-money laundering, pattern mining and activity clustering (where data from traditional currencies is rarely available). The formalism of temporal networks offers a natural way of representing this data and offers access to a wealth of metrics and models. However, the large scale of the data presents a challenge using standard graph analysis techniques. We use temporal motifs to analyse two Bitcoin datasets and one NFT dataset, using sequences of three transactions and up to three users. We show that the commonly used technique of simply counting temporal motifs over all users and all time can give misleading conclusions. Here we also study the motifs contributed by each user and discover that the motif distribution is heavy-tailed and that the key players have diverse motif signatures. We study the motifs that occur in different time periods and find events and anomalous activity that cannot be seen just by a count on the whole dataset. Studying motif completion time reveals dynamics driven by human behaviour as well as algorithmic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Private Blotto: Viewpoint Competition with Polarized Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are responsible for collecting and disseminating vast quantities of content. Recently, however, they have also begun enlisting users in helping annotate this content - for example, to provide context or label disinformation. However, users may act strategically, sometimes reflecting biases (e.g. political) about the "right" label. How can social media platforms design their systems to use human time most efficiently? Historically, competition over multiple items has been explored in the Colonel Blotto game setting (Borel, 1921). However, they were originally designed to model two centrally-controlled armies competing over zero-sum "items", a specific scenario with limited modern-day application. In this work, we propose and study the Private Blotto game, a variant with the key difference that individual agents act independently, without being coordinated by a central "Colonel". We completely characterize the Nash stability of this game and how this impacts the amount of "misallocated effort" of users on unimportant items. We show that the outcome function (aggregating multiple labels on a single item) has a critical impact, and specifically contrast a majority rule outcome (the median) as compared to a smoother outcome function (mean). In general, for median outcomes we show that instances without stable arrangements only occur for relatively few numbers of agents, but stable arrangements may have very high levels of misallocated effort. For mean outcome functions, we show that unstable arrangements can occur even for arbitrarily large numbers of agents, but when stable arrangements exist, they always have low misallocated effort. We conclude by discussing implications our results have for motivating examples in social media platforms and political competition.</description>
