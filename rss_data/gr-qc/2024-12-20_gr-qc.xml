      <title>Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia black hole coupled with a cloud of strings: thermodynamics, shadows and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an exact black hole solution for the Einstein gravity in the presence of Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia non-linear electrodynamics and a cloud of strings. The resulting black hole solution is singular, and the solution becomes non-singular when gravity is coupled with Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia non-linear electrodynamics only. This solution interpolates between Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia black hole, Letelier black hole and Schwarzschild black hole { in the absence of cloud of strings parameter, magnetic monopole charge and both of them, respectively}. We also discuss the thermal properties of this black hole and find that the solution follows the modified first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we estimate the solution's black hole shadow and quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Tidal contributions to the full gravitational waveform to the second-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the different steps to include the adiabatic tidal effects to the gravitational waveform amplitude for quasi-circular non-spinning compact binaries up to the second-and-a-half post-Newtonian (PN) order. The amplitude, that relates the two gravitational wave polarizations, is decomposed onto the basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin -2, parametrized by the two numbers $(\ell,m)$, where the modes of the waveform correspond to the coefficients of the decomposition. These modes are readily computed from the radiative multipole moments. They can be expressed in a PN-expanded form as well as in a factorized form, suitable to be directly included in effective-one-body models to describe more accurately the waveform of binary neutron stars. We also provide the energy flux and phasing evolution in time and frequency domain. The results presented in this article are collected in an ancillary file.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent developments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic boundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry, giving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of scattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of the metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of general relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to the standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad field to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to represent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel encoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the implications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing on the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald--Zoupas prescription.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Kosambi-Cartan-Chern theory to perform an extensive examination of Jacobi stability of geodesics around rotating black hole solutions to dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that introduces modifications to General Relativity via a scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature scalars. We present a comparative study between Jacobi and Liapunov stability, pointing out the advantages of the more geometrical method over the usual Liapunov approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>An analytical joint prior for effective spins for inference on the spin distribution of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analytical form of the joint prior of effective spin parameters, $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\chi_\mathrm{p}$, assuming an isotropic and uniform-in-magnitude spin distribution. This is a vital factor in performing hierarchical Bayesian inference for studying the population properties of merging compact binaries observed with gravitational waves. In previous analyses, this was evaluated numerically using kernel density estimation (KDE). However, we find that this numerical approach is inaccurate in certain parameter regions, where both $|\chi_\mathrm{eff}|$ and $\chi_\mathrm{p}$ are small. Our analytical approach provides accurate computations of the joint prior across the entire parameter space and enables more reliable population inference. Employing our analytic prior, we reanalyze binary black holes in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. While the results are largely unchanged, log-likelihood errors due to the use of the inaccurate prior evaluations are $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Since these errors accumulate with the increasing number of events, our analytical prior will be crucial in the future analyses.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Einstein's analogy: black holes as gradient-index lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Albert Einstein, gravitation is analogous to an optical medium. Building on this idea, various definitions of the gradient-index (GRIN) medium representing curved spacetime have been proposed; often, these approaches demand advanced knowledge of General Relativity and its associated mathematical methods. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating the form of GRIN media that reproduces the behavior of light in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole or about the equatorial spacetime of a Kerr black hole. Our approach is based on Noether's theorem that leads to optical Fermat's principle, leveraging the system's symmetry, resulting in a general method for finding GRIN media in a flat spacetime that reproduces the behavior of light in Schwarzschild-like spacetimes where only using photon trajectories as input. This approach is also valid for material particles and provides a complementary understanding of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of the Inner Horizon in Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes: Insights into Mass Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known instability of the inner horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, first suggested by Simpson and Penrose, although studied extensively, has remained illusive so far as several studies led to varied conclusions about the dynamical nature of the inner horizon. In this work, we therefore focus upon the dynamic nature of the inner horizon in the course of mass inflation. We model this phenomenon with a massive chargeless scalar field minimally coupled with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. Employing the Einstein-Maxwell field equation coupled with the Klein-Gordon equation, we obtain a nonlinear dynamical equation for the inner horizon coupled with the dynamics of the mass function and the scalar field. In the S-wave approximation, we develop a perturbative solution about the dynamic inner horizon and obtain an analytical solution as a polynomial of twelfth degree. Our detailed analysis shows that the inner horizon moves inward in the course of mass inflation. Higher the mass of the scalar field, faster are the shrinking rate of the inner horizon and the rate of mass inflation. Our solution for dynamic shrinking of the inner horizon suggests that a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime tends towards a Schwarzschild-like geometry, in the infinite advanced time limit.</description>

      <title>Relational Observables in Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</description>

      <title>Running Einstein Constant and the Vacuum Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a revised formulation of General Relativity for cosmological contexts, in which the Einstein constant varies with the energy density of the Universe. We demonstrate that this modification has no direct phenomenological impact on the Universe's dynamics or on particle motion within the expanding cosmos. Assuming a state close to vacuum, here defined by the vanishing product of the Einstein coupling constant and the Universe's energy density, we perform a Taylor expansion of the theory. In this framework, the vacuum energy problem is addressed, and an additional constant pressure term, which induces a Chaplygin-like contribution to the dark energy equation of state, arises in the late-time dynamics. The correction to the late-time Hubble parameter is investigated by comparing theoretical predictions with the late Universe observational data. Our findings indicate that the current value of the vacuum energy is consistent with zero. Alternatively, the expansion used in our formulation would no longer be valid if the current state significantly deviates from the assumed near-vacuum condition. Implications of the modified $\Lambda$CDM model with respect to the Hubble tension are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and quasi-normal modes of the Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the model of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed into a dark matter halo with a relativistic Hernquist profile, the Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole, and obtain its tidal Love numbers and quasi-normal modes. We thoroughly compare our odd and even parity perturbation equations with the literature and point out that two distinct choices of matter perturbations lead to distinct spectra. We establish that the quasi-normal modes admit qualitatively distinct scaling laws in terms of dark matter densities for non-relativistic and relativistic halos. We develop a stable numerical scheme for computing tidal Love numbers based on asymptotic series expansions. We further comment upon the existence of matter configurations obeying the dominant energy condition that lead to multiple light rings.</description>

      <title>Harmonic spectrum of pulsar timing array angular correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle $\gamma$ between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present, so PTAs "reconstruct the HD curve" by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. The angular pattern may be also expressed as a "harmonic sum" of Legendre polynomials ${\rm P}_l(\cos \gamma)$, with coefficients $c_l$. Here, assuming that the GWs and pulsar noise are described by a Gaussian ensemble, we derive optimal estimators for the $c_l$ and compute their variance. We consider two choices for "optimal". The first minimizes the variance of each $c_l$, independent of the values of the others. The second finds the set of $c_l$ which minimizes the (squared) deviation of the reconstructed correlation curve from its mean. These are analogous to the so-called "dirty" and "clean" maps of the electromagnetic and (audio-band) GW backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational quasinormal modes in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Applications of machine learning in gravitational wave research with current interferometric detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the current state of machine learning in gravitational-wave research with interferometric detectors. Such applications are often still in their early days, but have reached sufficient popularity to warrant an assessment of their impact across various domains, including detector studies, noise and signal simulations, and the detection and interpretation of astrophysical signals.
  In detector studies, machine learning could be useful to optimize instruments like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and future detectors. Algorithms could predict and help in mitigating environmental disturbances in real time, ensuring detectors operate at peak performance. Furthermore, machine-learning tools for characterizing and cleaning data after it is taken have already become crucial tools for achieving the best sensitivity of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA network.
  In data analysis, machine learning has already been applied as an alternative to traditional methods for signal detection, source localization, noise reduction, and parameter estimation. For some signal types, it can already yield improved efficiency and robustness, though in many other areas traditional methods remain dominant.
  As the field evolves, the role of machine learning in advancing gravitational-wave research is expected to become increasingly prominent. This report highlights recent advancements, challenges, and perspectives for the current detector generation, with a brief outlook to the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effects of quartic self-interactions on the dynamics of a binary system due to a (nearly) massless scalar field conformally coupled to matter. We investigate the deviations from General Relativity at the conservative level and put a bound on the self-coupling $ \lambda \lesssim (\beta^2 G_N M_\odot^2)^{-1}$ where $\beta$ is the conformal coupling of the scalar to matter. We also consider the radiative sector where we use the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to find the tail interactions which couple the multipoles of the binary system and induce a small advance of the periastron.</description>

      <title>Response of a Kerr black hole to a generic tidal perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the response of non-extremal as well as extremal Kerr black holes (BHs) to generic tidal perturbations. The real part of the tidal response provides the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Our results suggest that the static as well as dynamical (linear-in-frequency) TLNs vanish for both Schwarzschild and slowly rotating Kerr BHs, under generic perturbations. The vanishing of static and dynamical TLNs also holds for axi-symmetric tidal perturbations of non-extremal and extremal Kerr BHs. In fact, even under generic tidal perturbations the static TLNs of non-extremal and extremal Kerr BHs vanish identically. The only case where TLNs do not vanish is when they are dynamical and arise in response to generic tidal perturbations of non-extremal and extremal Kerr BHs. We also discuss the symmetries of the non-zero dynamical TLNs for both non-extremal and extremal Kerr BHs, under the change of sign of the spin, for electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.</description>

      <title>Probing time-dependent scalar wigs with extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave emission from extreme mass ratio inspirals, key targets for the upcoming space-based detector LISA, considering the scenario where the lighter black hole in the binary is endowed by a long-lived, time-dependent scalar field configuration, known as a scalar wig. We develop a formalism to compute scalar perturbations for extreme mass ratio inspirals on circular orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and apply this framework to compute additional fluxes induced by the scalar wig as well as their dependence on the scalar field properties. Our computation provides strong indications that in this scenario the presence of the scalar field does not significantly affect the orbital motion and the gravitational waveform.</description>

      <title>On the perturbed Friedmann equations in Newtonian Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, low mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes Factor in support of no phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves From Dark Binaries With Finite-Range Dark Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper calculates the stochastic gravitational wave background from dark binaries with finite-range attractive dark forces, complementing previous works which consider long-range dark forces. The finiteness of the dark force range can dramatically modify both the initial distributions and evolution histories of the binaries. The generated gravitational wave spectrum is enhanced in the intermediate frequency regime and exhibits interesting "knee" and "ankle" features, the most common of which is related to the turn on of the dark force mediator radiation. Other such spectral features are related to changes in the binary merger lifetime and the probability distribution for the initial binary separation. The stochastic gravitational wave background from sub-solar-mass dark binaries is detectable by both space- and ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Spatial anisotropies from long wavelength tensor modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the leading physical effect of superhorizon scalar and tensor fluctuations on a flat adiabatic universe. We show that it is described by one of three Bianchi solutions. It is well known that adiabatic scalar perturbations with wavelengths comparable to the horizon scale can mimic the spatial curvature of an otherwise flat Friedmann universe. Similarly, adiabatic tensor perturbations in the same long-wavelength limit are known to behave as a homogeneous shearing of the background spacetime, as observed in Bianchi type I cosmologies. In this work, we examine whether the simultaneous evolution of scalar and tensor adiabatic modes in the near-horizon regime could give rise to more general Bianchi cosmologies, including spatially curved cases. Assuming a matter-dominated universe, and working to first order in perturbations but at second order in a spatial gradient expansion, we identify modes that are either pure gauge or unsourced, rendering them unobservable. This enables us to derive an effective metric that retains the spatial symmetries of three known Bianchi cosmologies: type I, V, and IX. These correspond to cases where the "curvature" induced by scalar perturbations is zero, negative, or positive, respectively.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (Blinded-MDC) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the Blinded-MDC to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. The discrepancy in $H_0$ is arising due to astrophysical mis-modeling, and in the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical populations of BBHs. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the \emph{asymptotic} symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their \emph{finite-distance} counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing \emph{intrinsic} and \emph{extrinsic} frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called \emph{soft edges}, extend to asymptotia and realize the corner charge algebra by ``pulling in'' the asymptotic one from infinity. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of \emph{soft boundary conditions}, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational \emph{quasi-local} one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is \emph{frame-dependent}; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory. Our work combines the study of boundary symmetries with the program of dynamical reference frames and we anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>New Modes for Vector Bosons in the Static Patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de Sitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective physical (squared) mass $\mu_{\mathrm{v}}^2 = m_{\mathrm{v}}^2 + 2(D-1)\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^{-2}$ which differs from the naive "Lagrangian" (squared) mass $m_{\mathrm{v}}^2$ that appears in the usual form of the Proca Lagrangian/action. In particular, we conjecture that the theory remains well-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range $-2(D-1) &lt; m_{\mathrm{v}}^2\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^2 &lt; 0$. We identify several interesting physical features of the "edge of stability" $m_{\mathrm{v}}^2\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^2 = -2(D-1)$. Fixing a static patch breaks the $D$-dimensional de Sitter isometries down to a "static patch subgroup", which explains why our theory may continue to be well-defined in the above mass range despite not fitting into a unitary irreducible representation of SO$(D,1)$. We conjecture that for situations such as ours, the usual $\mathrm{SO}(D,1)$ "Higuchi bound" on unitarity is replaced by the concept of the edge of stability. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of our theory remarkably simplifies, becoming equivalent to the $p$-wave sector of an ordinary massive scalar. In this case we can explicitly check that the $D = 3$ $s$-wave sector remains well-defined -- both classically and quantum mechanically -- in the above mass range. In the course of our analysis, we will derive the general classical solution and the quasinormal frequency spectrum for the massive vector Boson in the static patch of dS$_D$, generalizing previous work by Higuchi [1], which was done for the special case $D = 4$. While this work was being completed, we became aware of upcoming work by Grewal, Law, and Lochab [2] which will contain a similar derivation.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of interpolation methods for time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) suppresses laser frequency noise by forming linear combinations of time-shifted interferometric measurements. The time-shift operation is implemented by interpolating discretely sampled data. To enable in-band laser noise reduction by eight to nine orders of magnitude, interpolation has to be performed with high accuracy. Optimizing the design of those interpolation methods is the focus of this work. Previous research that studied constant time-shifts suggested Lagrange interpolation as the interpolation method for TDI. Its transfer function performs well at low frequency but requires a high number of coefficients. Furthermore, when applied in TDI we observed prominent time-domain features when a time-varying shift scanned over a pure integer sample shift. To limit this effect we identify an additional requirement for the interpolation kernel: when considering time-varying shifts the interpolation kernel must be sufficiently smooth to avoid unwanted time-domain transitions that produce glitch-like features in power spectral density estimates. The Lagrange interpolation kernel exhibits a discontinuous first derivative by construction, which is insufficient for the application to LISA or other space-based GW observatories. As a solution we propose a novel design method for interpolation kernels that respect a predefined requirement on in-band interpolation residuals and that possess continuous derivatives up to a prescribed order. Using this method we show that an interpolation kernel with 22 coefficients is sufficient to respect LISA's picometre-requirement and to allow for a continuous first derivative which suppresses the magnitude of the time-domain transition adequately. The reduction from 42 (Lagrange interpolation) to 22 coefficients enables us to save computational cost and increases robustness against artefacts in the data.</description>

      <title>Field-dependent diffeomorphisms and the transformation of surface charges between gauges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying gauge theories in the presence of boundaries, local symmetry transformations are typically classified as gauge or physical depending on whether the associated charges vanish or not. Here, we propose that physical charges should further be refined into "dynamical" or "kinematical" depending on whether they are associated with flux-balance laws or not. To support this proposal, we analyze (A)dS$_3$ gravity with boundary Weyl rescalings and compare the solution spaces in Bondi-Sachs and Fefferman-Graham coordinates. Our results show that the Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not in the Fefferman-Graham gauge. Conversely, the charges arising from the metric Chern-Simons Lagrangian behave in the opposite way. This indicates that the gauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and angular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations: the Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the associated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These properties justify assigning the Weyl charge a kinematical status. These results can also be derived using the field-dependent diffeomorphism that maps between the two gauges. Importantly, this diffeomorphism does not act tensorially on the variational bi-complex due to its field dependency, and is able to "toggle" charges on or off. This provides an example of a large diffeomorphism $\textit{between}$ gauges, as opposed to a residual diffeomorphism $\textit{within}$ a gauge.</description>

      <title>General tradeoff relation of fundamental quantum limits for linear multiparameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear measurement is an important class of measurements for sensing classical signals including gravitational wave (GW), dark matter, infrared ray, rotation rate, etc. In this Letter, we focus on multiparameter linear measurement and establish a general tradeoff relation that tightly constrains the fundamental quantum limits of two independent parameters in a monochromatic classical signal detected by any linear quantum device. Such a tradeoff relation is universal and fundamental for multiparameter linear measurement since arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Compared with the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound, our tradeoff bound can completely identify the dependence between the attainable precision limits on estimated parameters. The dependence becomes more obvious such that the individual precision can not simultaneously reach the quantum limit as the so-called incompatible coefficient rises. Eventually, we find a necessary condition under which an optimal measurement protocol can saturate the general tradeoff relation, and show that the measurement phase can be tuned for adjusting different precision weight. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.</description>

      <title>Inflation in non-local hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, we incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We analyse the dynamical structure of the theory and, adopting a scalar-tensor perspective, assess the stability conditions to ensure the absence of ghost instabilities. Focusing on a special class of well-defined hybrid actions -- where local and non-local contributions are carried by distinct types of curvature -- we investigate the feasibility of inflation within the resulting Einstein-frame multi-field scenario. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields, reflecting the non-local structure of the original frame, influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d&gt;2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</description>

      <title>Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from local distortions to global model checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [43] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, cosmologically model-independent, statistical analysis of the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae spectroscopic dataset, improving a standard methodology adopted by Lane et al. We use the Tripp equation for supernova standardisation alone, thereby avoiding any potential correlation in the stretch and colour distributions. We compare the standard homogeneous cosmological model, i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, and the timescape cosmology which invokes backreaction of inhomogeneities. Timescape, while statistically homogeneous and isotropic, departs from average Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker evolution, and replaces dark energy by kinetic gravitational energy and its gradients, in explaining independent cosmological observations. When considering the entire Pantheon+ sample, we find very strong evidence ($\ln B&gt; 5$) in favour of timescape over $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, even restricting the sample to redshifts beyond any conventional scale of statistical homogeneity, $z &gt; 0.075$, timescape is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B&gt; 1$. These results provide evidence for a need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explicitly construct the coordinates associated with the Penrose diagram in spacetimes connected via a spacelike thin shell in the following two examples: the generalized black-to-white hole bounce with mass difference and the Schwarzschild-to-de Sitter transition. We point out the issue of the first junction condition in the Penrose diagram constructed by cutting and pasting analytically known metrics with spherical symmetry by a static spacelike thin shell. With the goal of a global conformal coordinate chart associated with the corresponding Penrose diagram without discontinuity at the thin shell, we give a procedure consisting of three conformal transformations that serve different purposes. The first two of them are used to generate a continuous coordinate patch covering the entire thin shell, and therefore, the Penrose diagram can be constructed properly by patches with overlapping. The third transformation removes any coordinate singularity reintroduced by the first two transformations at the event horizons.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Massive Particles in the Charged NUT Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In astronomy, gravitational lensing of light leads to the formation of multiple images, arcs, Einstein rings, and, most important, the shadow of black holes. Analogously in the vicinity of a massive compact object massive particles, following timelike geodesics, are gravitationally lensed. So far gravitational lensing of massive particles was mainly investigated in the weak and strong field limits. In this paper we will, for the first time, investigate exact gravitational lensing of massive particles using the example of the charged Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) metric (and its special cases) which contains three physical parameters, the mass parameter $m$, the electric charge $e$, and the gravitomagnetic charge $n$. We will first discuss and solve the equations of motion for unbound timelike geodesics using elementary and Jacobi's elliptic functions and Legendre's elliptic integrals. Then we will introduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the $z$ component of the angular momentum and the Carter constant to the energy $E$ of the particles along the timelike geodesics and latitude-longitude coordinates on the celestial sphere of a stationary observer in the domain of outer communication. We will use these relations to derive the angular radius of the particle shadow of the black hole, to formulate an exact lens equation, and to derive the travel time of the particles in terms of the time coordinate and the proper time. Finally, we will discuss the impact of the physical parameters and the energy of the particles on observable lensing features. We will also comment on how we can use these features alone and in a multimessenger context together with the corresponding features for light rays to determine if an astrophysical black hole can be described by the charged NUT metric or one of its special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy based flux-limiting (EFL) scheme is a novel approach designed to accurately resolve shocks and discontinuities in special and general relativistic hydrodynamics. By adaptively adjusting the numerical fluxes, the EFL method mitigates oscillations and preserves smooth transition across discontinuities in shock-dominated flows. Here, we extend the applicability of the EFL method beyond special/general relativistic hydrodynamics to scalar conservation laws and show how to treat systems without a thermodynamic entropy. This is an indication that the method has universal applicability to any system of partial differential equations that can be written in conservation form. We also present some further very challenging special/general relativistic hydrodynamics applications of the EFL method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of formation of a traversable wormhole in General Relativity supported by particle creation mechanism. The repulsive back-reaction pressure generated through this mechanism can be thought of as a source of sustaining a traversable wormhole. In the first part of this paper, we model a wormhole geometry by assuming an inverse powerlaw variation of particle creation pressure within the wormhole geometry, and the shape function for the wormhole is obtained, assuming a finite redshift function. By stabilizing the wormhole structure, based on the causality of sound-speed we obtained the existence range of the parameter $\beta$ associated with particle creation mechanism. The general shape function obtained is found to adhere to the feasibility conditions of a viable wormhole geometry. Then we studied the 2D and 3D embedding derived for the obtained shape function. In the second part of the paper, we followed the reverse approach of the aforementioned treatment, where we derived the particle creation pressures by assuming three commonly utilized toy shape-functions. The energy conditions are then investigated for all these cases. In essence, particle creation phenomena inside the wormhole may indeed provide for the possibility of sustenance of stable wormhole structure.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>

Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing a homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

Abstract: The findings discussed in "Apparent Horizons of the Thakurta Spacetime and the Description of Cosmological Black Holes" deviate from prior research, particularly our study in Phys. Rev. D 95, 084031 (2017). We clarify this inconsistency, which arises from employing a coordinate transformation covering a distinct region of spacetime -- specifically one considered inaccessible due to its location beyond a singularity, making it unreachable from infinity. Additionally, we provide a concrete example where the distinct horizons and spacetime regions are readily discernible.</description>

      <title>The curvature dependence of gravitational-wave tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy extensions to General Relativity modify the Einstein-Hilbert action with higher-order curvature corrections and theory-specific coupling constants. The order of these corrections imprints a universal curvature dependence on observations while the coupling constant controls the deviation strength. In this Letter, we leverage the theory-independent expectation that modifications to the action of a given order in spacetime curvature (Riemann tensor and contractions) lead to observational deviations that scale with the system length-scale to a corresponding power. Focusing on gravitational wave observations, the relevant scale is the binary total mass, and deviations scale as a power of mass $p$ related to the action order. For example, $p=4,6$ arise in effective field theory for cubic and quartic theories respectively. We incorporate this universal scaling into theory-agnostic tests of General Relativity with current gravitational-wave observations, thus enabling constraints on the curvature scaling without compromising the agnostic nature of these tests. This introduces a flexible yet highly interpretable new paradigm for tests of General Relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>A weakly-modeled search for compact binary coalescences in Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is a project of third generation gravitational wave (GW) detector with a planned sensitivity 10 times better than current detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The high rate of GW signals expected in the data will pose several data analysis challenges, like the ability to disentangle overlapping signals or the need to dimension the computational resources required to treat all the candidate events. We explore the behaviour and the performances of a data analysis pipeline designed to search for unmodelled GW signals with duration 1 to 1000 s on a mock dataset that consists of 1 month of data following ET design sensitivity on top of which is added a realistic distribution of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unmodelled searches are intrinsically less sensitive to CBC signals than template-based searches, but are computationally cheaper and more robust to uncertainties in the waveforms. This search recovers 38% of the total number of injected binary black hole (BBH) signals, including 89% of the systems with a total mass above 100 solar masses, as well as the majority of binary neutron star (BNS) signals closer than 850 Mpc (z = 0.17). It is also able to estimate the chirp mass of the recovered BNS with an average precision of 1.3%. Therefore, we show that this unmodelled search is able to detect a substantial amount of CBC events at a relatively low computational cost, which makes it interesting for low latency analyses and independent validation of detections made by matched filtering pipelines. We also find that the presence of many CBC signals only marginally impacts the sensitivity of the search to other kinds of unmodelled long duration transient signals, by 3% in average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The groundwork for the theory of dark matter superfluidity has already been laid. The dynamics of the theory are determined from the non-relativistic P(X) superfluid Lagrangian density which models MOND phenomenology when coupled to baryons on galactic scale. The same Lagrangian reduces to {\Lambda}CDM on cosmological scale at zeroth order. This suggests that cold dark matter undergo Bose-Einstein condensation in galaxies. In this paper, we extend the non-relativistic theory to include the relativistic corrections within the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. We also explore how matter perturbations grow in the weak-field limit of the relativistic theory proposed in [1].</description>

      <title>Constrained transit cosmological models in $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate constrained transit cosmological models in the most recent proposed modified gravity theory, $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity. We obtain the modified field equations for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime metric. We constrain the equation of continuity by imposing the equation of state for the perfect fluid source $p=-\frac{1}{3}\rho+p_{0}$ so that we get energy conservation equation as $\dot{\rho}+3H(\rho+p)=0$, (because generally, energy conservation law is not satisfied in $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity). Using this constraint, we establish a relation between the energy density parameters $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, and $\Omega_{f0}$ and the Hubble function. After that, we made observational constraints on $H(z)$ to obtain the best-fit present values of $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, and $H_{0}$. Then, we use these best-fit values of energy parameters to investigate cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, the effective equation of state $\omega_{eff}$, and the energy density parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $\Omega_{r}$, and $\Omega_{f}$ to learn more about the components and history of the expanding universe. We found an effective EoS parameter in the range $-1\le \omega_{eff}\le\frac{1}{3}$ with a deceleration-acceleration transition redshift value of $z_{t}=0.6377, 0.6424$ along two datasets cosmic chronometer (CC) and Pantheon SNIa, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ghost Pilgrim Dark Energy Fractal Cosmology with Observational Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore dark energy models, mainly ghost, generalized ghost, and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy models within the framework of fractal cosmology. To obtain solutions for the field equations, we employ a parameterization of the deceleration parameter as proposed by \textit{R.K. Tiwari}. By utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solutions. The analysis is based on observational datasets, including 57 data points from the Observational Hubble Data ($OHD$) and, 1048 points from the $Pantheon$ Supernovae sample. This approach allows us to assess the viability of the dark energy models in describing the current cosmic expansion. According to the effective equation-of-state parameter, the model maintains itself in the quintessence era and ultimately switches into the Einstein-de Sitter model. Furthermore, we investigate the statefinder, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. The energy conditions of each model satisfy the weak and null energy conditions but violate the strong energy condition. We find that the $Om(z)$ curves for the data samples exhibit a consistently negative slope throughout the entire range.</description>

      <title>On the universality of instability in the fundamental quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on a criterion for the emergence of instability in the fundamental mode recently observed by Cheung {\it et al.}, as a universal phenomenon in the context of black hole perturbations. Such instability is characterized by an exponential spiral, deviating from the quasinormal frequencies due to an insignificant perturbation moving away from the compact object. Our analysis begins with a specific case involving a truncated P\"oschl-Teller potential for which we derive an explicit form of the criterion. Notably, it is shown analytically, contrary to other cases studied in the literature, that the fundamental mode is stable. These derivations are then generalized to a broader context, embracing two underlying mathematical formalisms. Specifically, the spiral is attributed to either the poles in the black hole's reflection amplitude or the zeros in the transmission amplitude. Additionally, we revisit and then generalize a toy model in which perturbations to the effective potential are disjointed, demonstrating that such a configuration invariably leads to instability in the fundamental mode, and the resulting outward spiral always occurs in the counter-clockwise direction. The derived criterion is not restricted to the fundamental mode but is generally relevant for the first few low-lying modes. We demonstrate numerically that the sprial's period and the frequency's relative deviation agree well with our analytical estimations.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and bending angle. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Wormhole solutions in generalized Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we seek for static spherically symmetric solutions representing wormhole configurations in generalized Rastall gravity (GRG). In this theory, a varying coupling parameter could act as dark energy (DE) and thus, it can be considered as responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe. We consider an anisotropic energy momentum tensor (EMT) as the supporting source for wormhole structure and further assume that there exists a linear relation between radial and tangential pressures and energy density. We therefore obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations of GRG, including the solutions with zero and nonzero redshift functions. For these solutions we find that the matter distribution obeys the physical reasonability conditions, i.e., the flare-out and the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions either at the throat and throughout the spacetime. The conditions on physical reasonability of the wormhole solutions put restrictions on model parameters. Hence, in the framework of GRG, asymptotically flat wormhole configurations can be built without the need of exotic matter. Gravitational lensing effects of the obtained solutions are also discussed and it is found that the throat of wormhole can effectively act as a photon sphere near which the light deflection angle takes arbitrarily large values.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Lyapunov exponent of circular light orbits in black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic systems near black holes satisfy a universal bound, $\lambda \leq \kappa_H$ linking the Lyapunov coefficient $\lambda$ associated with unstable orbits to surface gravity $\kappa_H$ of the event horizon. A natural question is whether this bound is satisfied by unstable circular null geodesics in the vicinity of black holes. However, there are known cases where this bound is violated. It is intriguing to ask whether there exists an alternative universal bound that is valid in such situations. We show that for any spherically symmetric, static black hole that satisfies Einstein's equations and the dominant energy condition, there exist other universal bounds relating the Lyapunov coefficient to a generalized notion of surface gravity at the photon sphere, as well as to the Unruh temperature locally measured by static observers. As applications, we show how these bounds also constrain the imaginary part of quasinormal modes in the eikonal regime and how the Lyapunov coefficient relates to the shadow size and the entropy of the horizon.</description>

Abstract: The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the publicly available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating-consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 118 different models. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia Inflationaris.</description>

      <title>A note on the bulk interpretation of the Quantum Extremal Surface formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining quantum information quantities directly in bulk quantum gravity is a difficult problem due to the fluctuations of spacetime. Some progress was made recently in \cite{Mertens:2022ujr}, which provided a bulk interpretation of the Bekenstein Hawking formula for two sided BTZ black holes in terms of the entanglement entropy of gravitational edge modes. We generalize those results to give a bulk entanglement entropy interpretation of the quantum extremal surface formula in AdS3 gravity, as applied to a single interval in the boundary theory. Our computation further supports the proposal that AdS3 gravity can be viewed as a topological phase in which the bulk gravity edge modes are anyons transforming under the quantum group $\SL^{+}_{q}(2,\mathbb{R})$. These edge modes appear when we cut open the Euclidean path integral along bulk co-dimension 2 slices, and satisfies a shrinkable boundary condition which ensures that the Gibbons-Hawking calculation gives the correct state counting.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed in terms of the properties of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $II_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP $\mathbf{2023}$, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that particle detectors coupled to a massless quantum field through its derivative can genuinely harvest entanglement form the field even when they are in causal contact in flat spacetime. This is particularly relevant since the derivative coupling model captures some interesting experimentally realizable systems and since the harvested entanglement peaks at full light contact.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure of scalar-Maxwell theory at the null boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Hamiltonian formalism to investigate the massless sector of scalar field theory coupled with Maxwell electrodynamics through the Pontryagin term. Specifically, we analyze asymptotic symmetries at the null infinity of this theory, conserved charges, and their algebra. We find that the theory possesses asymptotic shift symmetries of the fields not present in the bulk manifold coming from the zero modes of the symplectic matrix of constraints. Consequently, we conclude that the real scalar field also contains asymptotic symmetries previously found in the literature by a different approach. We show that these symmetries are the origin of the electric-magnetic duality in electromagnetism with the topological Pontryagin term, and obtain non-trivial central extension between the electric and magnetic conserved charges. Finally, we examine the full interacting theory and find that, due to the interaction, the symmetry generators are more difficult to identify among the constraints, such that we obtain them in the weak-coupling limit. We find that the asymptotic structure of the theory simplifies due to a fast fall-off of the scalar field, leading to decoupled scalar and Maxwell asymptotic sectors, and losing the electric-magnetic duality.</description>

      <title>Gauging generalised symmetries in linear gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of a free spin-2 field on Minkowski spacetime has 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries associated with conserved currents formed by contractions of the linearised Riemann tensor with conformal Killing-Yano 2-forms. We show that a subset of these can be interpreted as Noether currents for specific shift symmetries of the graviton that involve a Killing vector and a closed 1-form parameter. We give a systematic method to gauge these 1-form symmetries by coupling the currents to background gauge fields and introducing a particular set of counter-terms involving the background fields. The simultaneous gauging of certain pairs of 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries is obstructed by the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. The anomalous pairs of symmetries are those which are related by gravitational duality. The implications of these anomalies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.</description>
