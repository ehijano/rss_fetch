      <title>RGDA-DDI: Residual graph attention network and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction via computational approaches has significant importance for understanding the functions and co-prescriptions of multiple drugs. However, the existing silico DDI prediction methods either ignore the potential interactions among drug-drug pairs (DDPs), or fail to explicitly model and fuse the multi-scale drug feature representations for better prediction. In this study, we propose RGDA-DDI, a residual graph attention network (residual-GAT) and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction. A residual-GAT module is introduced to simultaneously learn multi-scale feature representations from drugs and DDPs. In addition, a dual-attention based feature fusion block is constructed to learn local joint interaction representations. A series of evaluation metrics demonstrate that the RGDA-DDI significantly improved DDI prediction performance on two public benchmark datasets, which provides a new insight into drug development.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for non-monotonic dose response, with an application to a kinetic proofreading model -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady state nonmonotonic ("biphasic") dose responses are often observed in experimental biology, which raises the control-theoretic question of identifying which possible mechanisms might underlie such behaviors. It is well known that the presence of an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) in a network may give rise to a nonmonotonic response. It has been conjectured that this condition is also necessary, i.e. that a nonmonotonic response implies the existence of an IFFL. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is false, and in the process prove a weaker version: that either an IFFL must exist or both a positive feedback loop and a negative feedback loop must exist. Towards this aim, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when minors of a symbolic matrix have mixed signs. Finally, we study in full generality when a model of immune T-cell activation could exhibit a steady state nonmonotonic dose response.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>
