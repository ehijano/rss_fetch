      <title>Generalized Kappa Distribution Function for Mixed Fermiom-Boson Quantum Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kappa distribution function applicable to systems comprising mixed fermions and bosons has been developed through the thermodynamic Gibbs potential utilizing the quantum versions of the Olbert kappa distributions. The generalised expressions of the partition function and the entropy have been evaluated for such mixed quantum systems. The analysis shows that boson-rich systems consistently exhibit higher entropy than fermion-rich systems. The distribution functions show heavy-tailed characteristics at low Kappa values, indicating the presence of superthermal particles. It is observed that relativistic effects lead to a significant increase in entropy.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Jetlets Associated with the Disappearance of a Satellite Spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent small-scale eruptions are fascinating phenomena in the solar atmosphere. However, their underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. On 2021 May 23, five recurrent jetlets (J1-J5) were observed continuously ejecting from a satellite spot located at the north edge of AR 12824. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength data from NVST, SDO, and IRIS, we investigate the physical characteristics of these jetlets and their relationship with the satellite spot. The widths of these jetlets range from 1300 to 2900 km, their lifetimes range span 3 to 10 minutes, and their projection speeds vary from 152.8 to 406.0 km s$^{-1}$. During the eruptions, the satellite spot moved northwest at a low speed of 376 $\pm$ 12 m s$^{-1}$. Its area gradually decreased due to magnetic cancellation with surrounding positive magnetic field, resulting in an average cancellation rate of 1.3$\times$10$^{18}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. Dark lanes that separated from the satellite spot and small pores were observed to move toward nearby these features or dark lanes with opposite polarities, eventually disappearing during the magnetic cancellation process. J4 was driven by an eruption of a micro-filament. Spectral observations revealed a redshift on the right side of J4 and a blueshift on the left side of its base, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal magnetic field of the satellite spot consistently exhibited a vortex structure throughout its evolution until it vanished. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation confirms that the satellite spot serves as one footpoint of a mini-flux rope. These observations reveal that these jetlets might result from three-dimensional null-point magnetic reconnection, initiated by the continuous eruption of a mini-flux-rope or multiple mini-flux-ropes, driven by sustained magnetic cancellation.</description>

      <title>How does the limited resolution of space plasma analyzers affect the accuracy of space plasma measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic errors in measured plasma velocity distribution functions and their corresponding velocity moments, arising from the limited energy and angular resolution of top-hat electrostatic analyzers. For this purpose, we develop a forward model of a concept analyzer that simulates observations of typical solar wind proton plasma particles with their velocities following a Maxwell distribution function. We then review the standard conversion of the observations to physical parameters and evaluate the errors arising from the limited resolution of the modeled instrument. We show that the limited resolution of the instrument results in velocity distributions that underestimate the core and overestimate the tails of the actual Maxwellian plasma velocity distribution functions. As a consequence, the velocity moments of the observed plasma underestimate the proton density and overestimate the proton temperature. Moreover, we show that the examined errors become significant for cold and fast plasma protons. We finally determine a mathematical formula that predicts these systematic inaccuracies based on specific plasma inputs and instrument features. Our results inform and contextualize future evaluations of observations by analyzers in various plasma regimes.</description>
