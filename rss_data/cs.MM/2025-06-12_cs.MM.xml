      <title>Dynamic Sub-region Search in Homogeneous Collections Using CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Querying with text-image-based search engines in highly homogeneous domain-specific image collections is challenging for users, as they often struggle to provide descriptive text queries. For example, in an underwater domain, users can usually characterize entities only with abstract labels, such as corals and fish, which leads to low recall rates. Our work investigates whether recall can be improved by supplementing text queries with position information. Specifically, we explore dynamic image partitioning approaches that divide candidates into semantically meaningful regions of interest. Instead of querying entire images, users can specify regions they recognize. This enables the use of position constraints while preserving the semantic capabilities of multimodal models. We introduce and evaluate strategies for integrating position constraints into semantic search models and compare them against static partitioning approaches. Our evaluation highlights both the potential and the limitations of sub-region-based search methods using dynamic partitioning. Dynamic search models achieve up to double the retrieval performance compared to static partitioning approaches but are highly sensitive to perturbations in the specified query positions.</description>

      <title>Learning Quality from Complexity and Structure: A Feature-Fused XGBoost Model for Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for reduced-reference video quality assessment (VQA), developed as part of the recent VQA Grand Challenge. Our method leverages low-level complexity and structural information from reference and test videos to predict perceptual quality scores. Specifically, we extract spatio-temporal features using Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and compute SSIM values from the test video to capture both texture and structural characteristics. These features are aggregated through temporal pooling, and residual features are calculated by comparing the original and distorted feature sets. The combined features are used to train an XGBoost regression model that estimates the overall video quality. The pipeline is fully automated, interpretable, and highly scalable, requiring no deep neural networks or GPU inference. Experimental results on the challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive correlation with subjective quality scores while maintaining a low computational footprint. The model's lightweight design and strong generalization performance suit real-time streaming quality monitoring and adaptive encoding scenarios.</description>

      <title>HopaDIFF: Holistic-Partial Aware Fourier Conditioned Diffusion for Referring Human Action Segmentation in Multi-Person Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The code is available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HopaDIFF.git.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Linguistic Constraints from External Knowledge Source for Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Task Federated Foundation Models for Next-Generation Extended Reality Systems: Towards Privacy-Preserving Distributed Intelligence in AR/VR/MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</description>

      <title>Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound, focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.</description>
