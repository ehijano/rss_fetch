      <title>A Consistency Analysis Method for Traffic Sequence Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend in the development of highly automated vehicles goes towards scenario-based methods. Traffic Sequence Charts are a visual but yet formal language for describing scenario-based requirements on highly automated vehicles. This work presents an approach for finding inconsistencies (conflicts) in a set of scenario-based requirements formalized with Traffic Sequence Charts. The proposed method utilizes satisfiability modulo theories solving on two-sided approximations of possible vehicle behavior. This ensures that found inconsistencies are not caused by approximations, but also occur when applying exact methods. Applicability and scalability of the analysis technique is evaluated in a case study.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Control for Chance-Constrained Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider distributionally robust optimal control of stochastic linear systems under signal temporal logic (STL) chance constraints when the disturbance distribution is unknown. By assuming that the underlying predicate functions are Lipschitz continuous and the noise realizations are drawn from a distribution having a concentration of measure property, we first formulate the underlying chance-constrained control problem as stochastic programming with constraints on expectations and propose a solution using a distributionally robust approach based on the Wasserstein metric. We show that by choosing a proper Wasserstein radius, the original chance-constrained optimization can be satisfied with a user-defined confidence level. A numerical example illustrates the efficacy of the method.</description>

      <title>Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When estimating models of of a multivariable dynamic system, a typical condition for consistency is to require the input signals to be persistently exciting, which is guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. In this paper it is investigated how such a condition can be relaxed by exploiting prior structural information on the multivariable system, such as structural zero elements in the transfer matrix or entries that are a priori known and therefore not parametrized. It is shown that in particular situations the data-informativity condition can be decomposed into different MISO (multiple input single output) situations, leading to relaxed conditions for the MIMO (multiple input multiple output) model. When estimating a single module in a linear dynamic network, the data-informativity conditions can generically be formulated as path-based conditions on the graph of the network. The new relaxed conditions for data-informativity will then also lead to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. Additionally the new expressions are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</description>

      <title>Analytical Optimized Traffic Flow Recovery for Large-scale Urban Transportation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has enhanced data collection in urban transportation through advanced traffic sensing devices. However, the high costs associated with installation and maintenance result in sparse traffic data coverage. To obtain complete, accurate, and high-resolution network-wide traffic flow data, this study introduces the Analytical Optimized Recovery (AOR) approach that leverages abundant GPS speed data alongside sparse flow data to estimate traffic flow in large-scale urban networks. The method formulates a constrained optimization framework that utilizes a quadratic objective function with l2 norm regularization terms to address the traffic flow recovery problem effectively and incorporates a Lagrangian relaxation technique to maintain non-negativity constraints. The effectiveness of this approach was validated in a large urban network in Shenzhen's Futian District using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. Analytical results indicate that the method achieves low estimation errors, affirming its suitability for comprehensive traffic analysis in urban settings with limited sensor deployment.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Controller for Parallel DC-DC Converters with ZIP Load and Constrained Output Voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear controller is designed for a parallel DC-DC converter system that feeds an unknown ZIP load, characterized by constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P), at the DC bus. The proposed controller ensures simultaneous voltage adjustment and power sharing in the large signal sense despite uncertainties in ZIP loads, DC input voltages, and other electrical parameters. To keep the output voltage within a desired range, we utilize a barrier function that is invertible, smoothly continuous, and strictly increasing. Its limits at infinity represent the upper and lower bounds for the output voltage. We apply the invertible transformation of the barrier function to the output voltage and then design the controller using the adaptive backstepping method. Using this barrier-function-based adaptive backstepping controller, uncertain parameters are identified on-line, and the voltage adjustment and power sharing objectives are established. Moreover, voltage constraint is not violated event in the presence of sudden and unknown large variations of load. The efficiency of the proposed nonlinear controller is evaluated through simulations of a parallel DC-DC converter system using the MATLAB/Simscape Electrical environment.</description>

      <title>Vehicular Resilient Control Strategy for a Platoon of Self-Driving Vehicles under DoS Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a platoon, multiple autonomous vehicles engage in data exchange to navigate toward their intended destination. Within this network, a designated leader shares its status information with followers based on a predefined communication graph. However, these vehicles are susceptible to disturbances, leading to deviations from their intended routes. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a significant type of cyber threat, can impact the motion of the leader. This paper addresses the destabilizing effects of DoS attacks on platoons and introduces a novel vehicular resilient control strategy to restore stability. Upon detecting and measuring a DoS attack, modeled with a time-varying delay, the proposed method initiates a process to retrieve the attacked leader. Through a newly designed switching system, the attacked leader transitions to a follower role, and a new leader is identified within a restructured platoon configuration, enabling the platoon to maintain consensus. Specifically, in the event of losing the original leader due to a DoS attack, the remaining vehicles do experience destabilization. They adapt their motions as a cohesive network through a distributed resilient controller. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through an illustrative case study, showing its applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Jam-absorption driving with data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data assimilation (DA) framework based on the extended Kalman filter-cell transmission model, designed to assist jam-absorption driving (JAD) operation to alleviate sag traffic congestion. To ascertain and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DA framework for JAD operation, in this paper, we initially investigated its impact on the motion and control performance of a single absorbing vehicle. Numerical results show that the DA framework effectively mitigated underestimated or overestimated control failures of JAD caused by misestimation of key parameters (e.g., free flow speed and critical density) of the traffic flow fundamental diagram. The findings suggest that the proposed DA framework can reduce control failures and prevent significant declines and deteriorations in JAD performance caused by changes in traffic characteristics, e.g., weather conditions or traffic composition.</description>

      <title>Online Residual Learning from Offline Experts for Pedestrian Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04069v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting unknown targets from data. We propose Online Residual Learning (ORL), a method that combines online adaptation with offline-trained predictions. At a lower level, we employ multiple offline predictions generated before or at the beginning of the prediction horizon. We augment every offline prediction by learning their respective residual error concerning the true target state online, using the recursive least squares algorithm. At a higher level, we treat the augmented lower-level predictors as experts, adopting the Prediction with Expert Advice framework. We utilize an adaptive softmax weighting scheme to form an aggregate prediction and provide guarantees for ORL in terms of regret. We employ ORL to boost performance in the setting of online pedestrian trajectory prediction. Based on data from the Stanford Drone Dataset, we show that ORL can demonstrate best-of-both-worlds performance.</description>

      <title>An updated look on the convergence and consistency of data-driven dynamical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep sequence models are receiving significant interest in current machine learning research. By representing probability distributions that are fit to data using maximum likelihood estimation, such models can model data on general observation spaces (both continuous and discrete-valued). Furthermore, they can be applied to a wide range of modelling problems, including modelling of dynamical systems which are subject to control. The problem of learning data-driven models of systems subject to control is well studied in the field of system identification. In particular, there exist theoretical convergence and consistency results which can be used to analyze model behaviour and guide model development. However, these results typically concern models which provide point predictions of continuous-valued variables. Motivated by this, we derive convergence and consistency results for a class of nonlinear probabilistic models defined on a general observation space. The results rely on stability and regularity assumptions, and can be used to derive consistency conditions and bias expressions for nonlinear probabilistic models of systems under control. We illustrate the results on examples from linear system identification and Markov chains on finite state spaces.</description>

      <title>Capturing Opportunity Costs of Batteries with a Staircase Supply-Demand Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of carbon neutrality, the role of batteries is indispensable. They provide pivotal flexibilities to counter uncertainties from renewables, preferably by participating in electricity markets. Unlike thermal generators, however, the dominant type of cost for batteries is opportunity cost, which is more vague and challenging to represent through bids in stipulated formats. This article shows the opposite yet surprising results: The demand-supply function of an ideal battery, considering its opportunity cost, is a staircase function with no more than five segments, which is a perfect match with existing rules in many real electricity markets. The demand-supply function shifts horizontally with price forecasts and vertically with the initial SOC. These results can be generalized to imperfect batteries and numerous battery-like resources, including battery clusters, air-conditioners, and electric vehicle charging stations, although the number of segments may vary. These results pave the way for batteries to participate in electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Towards a Socially Acceptable Competitive Equilibrium in Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of energy sharing between a population of price-taking agents who adopt decentralized primal-dual gradient dynamics to find the Competitive Equilibrium (CE). Although the CE is efficient, it does not ensure fairness and can potentially lead to high prices. As the agents and market operator share a social responsibility to keep the price below a certain socially acceptable threshold, we propose an approach where the agents modify their utility functions in a decentralized way. We introduce a dynamic feedback controller for the primal-dual dynamics to steer the agents to a Socially acceptable Competitive Equilibrium (SCE). We demonstrate our theoretical findings in a case study.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Covert Intrusions: Detection of Fault-Masking Cyberattacks on Differential Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line Current Differential Relays (LCDRs) are high-speed relays progressively used to protect critical transmission lines. However, LCDRs are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Fault-Masking Attacks (FMAs) are stealthy cyberattacks performed by manipulating the remote measurements of the targeted LCDR to disguise faults on the protected line. Hence, they remain undetected by this LCDR. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework to detect FMAs. The first module is a Mismatch Index (MI) developed from the protected transmission line's equivalent physical model. The MI is triggered only if there is a significant mismatch in the LCDR's local and remote measurements while the LCDR itself is untriggered, which indicates an FMA. After the MI is triggered, the second module, a neural network-based classifier, promptly confirms that the triggering event is a physical fault that lies on the line protected by the LCDR before declaring the occurrence of an FMA. The proposed framework is tested using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can accurately detect FMAs on LCDRs and is not affected by normal system disturbances, variations, or measurement noise. Our experimental results using OPAL-RT's real-time simulator confirm the proposed solution's real-time performance capability.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Theta Method for Systems with Multiple Time-Delayed Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the numerical stability and accuracy of implicit time-domain integration (TDI) methods when applied for the solution of a power system model impacted by time delays. Such a model is generally formulated as a set of delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) in non index-1 Hessenberg form. In particular, the paper shows that numerically stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, such as the trapezoidal and the Theta method, can become unstable when applied to a power system that includes a significant number of delayed variables. Numerical stability is discussed through a scalar test delay differential equation, as well as through a matrix pencil approach that accounts for the DDAEs of any given dynamic power system model. Simulation results are presented in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, a novel result for inferring uniform global, not semi-global, exponential stability in the sense of Lyapunov with respect to input-affine systems from global uniform exponential stability properties with respect to their associated Lie-bracket systems is shown. The result is applied to adapt dither frequencies to find a sufficiently high gain in adaptive control of linear unknown systems, and a simple numerical example is simulated to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Properties of Immersions for Systems with Multiple Limit Sets with Implications to Learning Koopman Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17045v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear immersions (such as Koopman eigenfunctions) of a nonlinear system have wide applications in prediction and control. In this work, we study the properties of linear immersions for nonlinear systems with multiple omega-limit sets. While previous research has indicated the possibility of discontinuous one-to-one linear immersions for such systems, it has been unclear whether continuous one-to-one linear immersions are attainable. Under mild conditions, we prove that any continuous immersion to a class of systems including finite-dimensional linear systems collapses all the omega-limit sets, and thus cannot be one-to-one. Furthermore, we show that this property is also shared by approximate linear immersions learned from data as sample size increases and sampling interval decreases. Multiple examples are studied to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Design Methodology for Control, Simulation, and Monitoring of Fluidic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a synthesis method for the design of digital twins applicable to various systems (pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical/electronic circuits). The methodology allows representing the operation of these systems through an active digital twin, thereby enabling a more suitable and easier computer-aided design, simulation, control, and monitoring. Furthermore, our methodology enables the detection of a system's actions on its own inputs (for example, in pneumatics: backflow of gases trapped in part of a fluidic system onto its own inputs). During the simulation or monitoring phase, the approach also facilitates real-time diagnosis of the controlled system. The outputs, on the controlled physical system or its digital twin, do not depend only on the current inputs but also on the history of the inputs and the history of internal states and variables. In other words, the underlying sequential logic has a memory while an only combinational logic approach does not. These capabilities can contribute to the digital transformation of the factory of the future.</description>

      <title>PowerFlowMultiNet: Multigraph Neural Networks for Unbalanced Three-Phase Distribution Systems</title>

Abstract: Efficiently solving unbalanced three-phase power flow in distribution grids is pivotal for grid analysis and simulation. There is a pressing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling large-scale unbalanced power grids that can provide accurate and fast solutions. To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network. PowerFlowMultiNet outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational speed. Rigorous testing reveals significantly lower error rates and a notable hundredfold increase in computational speed for large power networks compared to model-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph-Based Machine Learning Ensemble Network Intrusion Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to detect malicious attacks continue to meet challenges. NIDS are often developed offline while they face auto-generated port scan infiltration attempts, resulting in a significant time lag from adversarial adaption to NIDS response. To address these challenges, we use hypergraphs focused on internet protocol addresses and destination ports to capture evolving patterns of port scan attacks. The derived set of hypergraph-based metrics are then used to train an ensemble machine learning (ML) based NIDS that allows for real-time adaption in monitoring and detecting port scanning activities, other types of attacks, and adversarial intrusions at high accuracy, precision and recall performances. This ML adapting NIDS was developed through the combination of (1) intrusion examples, (2) NIDS update rules, (3) attack threshold choices to trigger NIDS retraining requests, and (4) a production environment with no prior knowledge of the nature of network traffic. 40 scenarios were auto-generated to evaluate the ML ensemble NIDS comprising three tree-based models. The resulting ML Ensemble NIDS was extended and evaluated with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Results show that under the model settings of an Update-ALL-NIDS rule (specifically retrain and update all the three models upon the same NIDS retraining request) the proposed ML ensemble NIDS evolved intelligently and produced the best results with nearly 100% detection performance throughout the simulation.</description>

      <title>A Black-Box Physics-Informed Estimator based on Gaussian Process Regression for Robot Inverse Dynamics Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the inverse dynamics of robots directly from data, adopting a black-box approach, is interesting for several real-world scenarios where limited knowledge about the system is available. In this paper, we propose a black-box model based on Gaussian Process (GP) Regression for the identification of the inverse dynamics of robotic manipulators. The proposed model relies on a novel multidimensional kernel, called \textit{Lagrangian Inspired Polynomial} (\kernelInitials{}) kernel. The \kernelInitials{} kernel is based on two main ideas. First, instead of directly modeling the inverse dynamics components, we model as GPs the kinetic and potential energy of the system. The GP prior on the inverse dynamics components is derived from those on the energies by applying the properties of GPs under linear operators. Second, as regards the energy prior definition, we prove a polynomial structure of the kinetic and potential energy, and we derive a polynomial kernel that encodes this property. As a consequence, the proposed model allows also to estimate the kinetic and potential energy without requiring any label on these quantities. Results on simulation and on two real robotic manipulators, namely a 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda, and a 6 DOF MELFA RV4FL, show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art black-box estimators based both on Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks in terms of accuracy, generality and data efficiency. The experiments on the MELFA robot also demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned model-based estimators, despite requiring less prior information.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a Robust Walking Algorithm for Underactuated Bipedal Robots in Non-flat, Non-stationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02486</link>

Abstract: This work explores an innovative algorithm designed to enhance the mobility of underactuated bipedal robots across challenging terrains, especially when navigating through spaces with constrained opportunities for foot support, like steps or stairs. By combining ankle torque with a refined angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model (ALIP), our method allows variability in the robot's center of mass height. We employ a dual-strategy controller that merges virtual constraints for precise motion regulation across essential degrees of freedom with an ALIP-centric model predictive control (MPC) framework, aimed at enforcing gait stability. The effectiveness of our feedback design is demonstrated through its application on the Cassie bipedal robot, which features 20 degrees of freedom. Key to our implementation is the development of tailored nominal trajectories and an optimized MPC that reduces the execution time to under 500 microseconds--and, hence, is compatible with Cassie's controller update frequency. This paper not only showcases the successful hardware deployment but also demonstrates a new capability, a bipedal robot using a moving walkway.</description>

      <title>A Flexible and Resilient Formation Approach based on Hierarchical Reorganization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional formation methods typically rely on fixed hierarchical structures, such as predetermined leaders or predefined formation shapes. These rigid hierarchies can render formations cumbersome and inflexible in complex environments, leading to potential failure if any leader loses connectivity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a reconfigurable affine formation that enhances both flexibility and resilience through hierarchical reorganization. The paper first elucidates the critical role of hierarchical reorganization, conceptualizing this process as involving role reallocation and dynamic changes in topological structures. To further investigate the conditions necessary for hierarchical reorganization, a reconfigurable hierarchical formation is developed based on graph theory, with its feasibility rigorously demonstrated. In conjunction with role transitions, a power-centric topology switching mechanism grounded in formation consensus convergence is proposed, ensuring coordinated resilience within the formation. Finally, simulations and experiments validate the performance of the proposed method. The aerial formations successfully performed multiple hierarchical reorganizations in both three-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces. Even in the event of a single leader's failure, the formation maintained stable flight through hierarchical reorganization. This rapid adaptability enables the robotic formations to execute complex tasks, including sharp turns and navigating through forests at speeds up to 1.9 m/s.</description>
