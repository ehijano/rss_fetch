      <title>Euler-type Recurrence Relation for Arbitrary Arithmetical Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interplay between the Lambert series and Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem gives an Euler-type recurrence relation for any given arithmetical function. As consequences of this, we present Euler-type recurrence relations for some well-known arithmetic functions. Furthermore, we derive Euler-type recurrence relations for certain partition functions and sum-of-divisors functions using infinite product identities of Jacobi and Gauss.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-adics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an archimedean, locally Cantor multi-field $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ which gives an analog of the $p$-adic number field at a place at infinity of a real quadratic extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. This analog is defined using a unit $1&lt;\theta\in \mathcal{O}_{K}^{\times}$, which plays the same role as the prime $p$ does in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$; the elements of $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ are then greedy Laurent series in the base $\theta$. There is a canonical inclusion of the integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with dense image in $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ and the operations of sum and product extend to multi-valued operations having at most three values, making $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$ a multi-field in the sense of Marty. We show that the (geometric) completions of 1-dimensional quasicrystals contained in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ map canonically to $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$. The motivation for this work arises in part from a desire to obtain a more arithmetic treatment of a place at infinity by replacing $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$, with an eye toward obtaining a finer version of class field theory incorporating the ideal arithmetic of quasicrystal rings.</description>

      <title>Cobham's theorem for the Gaussian integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the four exponentials conjecture, Hansel and Safer showed that if a subset $S$ of the Gaussian integers is both $\alpha=-m+i $- and $\beta=-n+i$-recognizable, then it is syndetic, and they conjectured that $S$ must be eventually periodic. Without assuming the four exponentials conjecture, we show that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are multiplicatively independent Gaussian integers, and at least one of $\alpha$, $\beta$ is not an $n$-th root of an integer, then any $\alpha$- and $\beta$-automatic configuration is eventually periodic; in particular we prove Hansel and Safer's conjecture. Otherwise, there exist non-eventually periodic configurations which are $\alpha$-automatic for any root of an integer $\alpha$. Our work generalises the Cobham-Semenov theorem to Gaussian numerations.</description>

      <title>Elementary Proofs and Generalizations of Recent Congruences of Thejitha and Fathima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Hirschhorn and the author, Thejitha and Fathima recently considered arithmetic properties satisfied by the function $a_5(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ wherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while the odd parts may appear in one of five colors. They proved two sets of Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by $a_5(n)$, relying heavily on modular forms. In this note, we prove their results via purely elementary means, utilizing generating function manipulations and elementary $q$-series dissections. We then extensively generalize these two sets of congruences to infinite families of divisibility properties in which the results of Thejitha and Fathima are specific instances.</description>

      <title>On the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular forms twisted by anticyclotomic Hecke characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f \in S_{2r}(\Gamma_0(N))$ be a normalized newform of weight $2r$ which is good at $p$. Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field of class number one in which every prime divisor of $pN$ splits. Let $\chi$ be an anticyclotomic Hecke character of $K$ which is crystalline at the primes above $p$ and such that $L(f,\chi,r)\neq 0$. We prove that the Tamagawa number conjecture for the critical value $L(f,\chi,r)$ follows from the Iwasawa main conjecture for the Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna $p$-adic $L$-function.</description>

      <title>Odd Spoof Multiperfect Numbers Of Higher Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on odd spoof multiperfect numbers to the case where spoof factor multiplicities exceed $2$. This leads to the identification of $11$ new integers that would be odd multiperfect numbers if one of their prime factors had higher multiplicity. An example is $181545$, which would be an odd multiperfect number if only one of its prime factors, $3$, had multiplicity $5$.</description>

      <title>Primes of the form $ax+by$ in certain intervals with small solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;a&lt;b$ be two relatively prime integers and $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ the set of non-negative integers. For any non-negative integer $\ell$, denote by $g_{\ell,a,b}$ the largest integer $n$ such that the equation $$n=ax+by,\quad (x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^{2} \quad (1)$$ has at most $\ell$ solutions. Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at least $\ell+1$ solutions for (1) and $\pi(x)$ the number of primes not exceeding $x$. In this article, we prove that for a fixed integer $a\ge 3$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, $$ \pi_{\ell,a,b}=\left(\frac{a-2}{2(\ell a+a-1)}+o(1)\right)\pi\bigl(g_{\ell,a,b}\bigr)\quad(\text{as}~ b\to\infty). $$ For any non-negative $\ell$ and relatively prime integers $a,b$, satisfying $e^{\ell+1}\leq a&lt;b$, we show that \begin{equation*} \pi_{\ell,a,b}&gt;0.005\cdot \frac{1}{\ell+1}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. \end{equation*} Let $\pi_{\ell,a,b}^{*}$ be the number of primes $p\leq g_{\ell,a,b}$ having at most $\ell$ solutions for (1). For an integer $a\ge 3$ and a large sufficiently integer $b$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we also prove that $$ \pi^{*}_{\ell,a,b}&gt;\frac{(2\ell+1)a}{2(\ell a+a-1)}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. $$ Moreover, if $\ell&lt;a&lt;b$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, then we have \begin{equation*} \pi^{*}_{\ell,a,b}&gt;\frac{\ell+0.02}{\ell+1}\frac{g_{\ell,a,b}}{\log g_{\ell,a,b}}. \end{equation*} These results generalize the previous ones of Chen and Zhu (2025), who established the results for the case $\ell=0$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative growth of multi-recurrence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1982, Schlickewei and Van der Poorten claimed that any multi-recurrence sequence has, essentially, maximal possible growth rate. Fourty years later, Fuchs and Heintze provided a non-effective proof of this statement. In this paper, we prove a quantitative version of that result by giving an explicit upper bound for the maximal possible growth rate of a multi-recurrence. Moreover, we also give a function field analogue of the result, answering a question posed by Fuchs and Heintze when proving a bound on the growth of multi-recurrences in number fields.</description>

      <title>On the $b$-ary expansion of a real number whose irrationality exponent is close to 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b \ge 2$ be an integer and $\xi$ an irrational real number. We establishes that, if the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is less than $2.324 \ldots$, then the $b$-ary expansion of $\xi$ cannot be `too simple', in a suitable sense. This improves the results of our previous paper [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci., 2017].</description>

      <title>The stable homology of Hurwitz modules and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the homology of modules for Hurwitz spaces stabilizes and compute its stable value. As one consequence, we compute the moments of Selmer groups in quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over suitably large function fields. As a second consequence, we deduce a version of Bhargava's conjecture, counting the number of $S_d$ degree $d$ extensions of $\mathbb F_q(t)$, for suitably large $q$. As a third consequence, we deduce that the homology of Hurwitz spaces associated to racks with a single component satisfy representation stability.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of lattice sums via telescoping over topographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topographs, introduced by Conway in 1997, are infinite trivalent planar trees used to visualize the values of binary quadratic forms. In this work, we study series whose terms are indexed by the vertices of a topograph and show that they can be evaluated using telescoping sums over its edges.
  Our technique provides arithmetic proofs for modular graph function identities arising in string theory, yields alternative derivations of Hurwitz-style class number formulas, and provides a unified framework for well-known Mordell-Tornheim series and Hata's series for the Euler constant $\gamma$.
  Our theorems are of the following spirit: we cut a topograph along an edge (called the root) into two parts, and then sum $\frac{1}{rst}$ (the reciprocal of the product of labels on regions adjacent to a vertex) over all vertices of one part. We prove that such a sum is equal to an explicit expression depending only on the root and the discriminant of the topograph.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of the colored Jones polynomial of the figure-eight knot under modular transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The colored Jones polynomial $J_{K,N}$ is an important quantum knot invariant in low-dimensional topology. In his seminal paper on quantum modular forms, Zagier predicted the behavior of $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. More precisely, Zagier made a prediction on the asymptotic value of the quotient $J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)})/ J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ for fixed $\gamma \in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, as $x \to \infty$ along rationals with bounded denominator. In the case of the figure-eight knot $4_1$, which is the most accessible case, there is an explicit formula for $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as a sum of certain trigonometric products called Sudler products. By periodicity, the behavior of $J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ under the mapping $x \mapsto x+1$ is trivial. For the second generator of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, Zagier conjectured that with respect to the mapping $x \mapsto 1/x$, the quotient $h(x) = \log ( J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i /x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at all irrationals. This conjecture was recently established by Aistleitner and Borda in the case of all irrationals that have an unbounded sequence of partial quotients in their continued fraction expansion. In the present paper we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture in full generality.</description>

Abstract: Using analytic number theory techniques, Altu\u{g} showed that the contribution of the trivial representation to the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for GL(2) over $\Q$ could be cancelled by applying a modified Poisson summation formula to the regular elliptic contribution. Drawing on recent works, we re-examine these methods from an adelic perspective.</description>

      <title>Effective Brauer-Siegel theorems for Artin $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a number field $K \neq \mathbb{Q}$, in a now classic work, Stark pinpointed the possible source of a so-called Landau-Siegel zero of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_K(s)$ and used this to give effective upper and lower bounds on the residue of $\zeta_K(s)$ at $s=1$. We extend Stark's work to give effective upper and lower bounds for the leading term of the Laurent expansion of general Artin $L$-functions at $s=1$ that are, up to the value of implied constants, as strong as could reasonably be expected given current progress toward the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Our bounds are completely unconditional, and rely on no unproven hypotheses about Artin $L$-functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A sequence over $G$ is a finite multiset of elements of $G$, and it is called product-one if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity of $G$. The large Davenport constant $\D(G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is, a product-one sequence that cannot be partitioned into two nontrivial product-one subsequences. Let $p,q$ be odd prime numbers with $p \mid q-1$ and let $C_q \rtimes C_p$ denote the non-abelian group of order $pq$. It is known that $\D(C_q \rtimes C_p) = 2q$. In this paper, we describe all minimal product-one sequences of length $2q$ over $C_q \rtimes C_p$. As an application, we further investigate the $k$-th elasticity (and, consequently, the union of sets containing $k$) of the monoid of product-one sequences over these groups.</description>

      <title>Coefficient systems on the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a conjecture (referred to as sur in the literature) in the representation theory of a reductive p-adic Lie group G which has important implications for the relationship between mod-p smooth representations and pro-p Iwahori-Hecke modules, and is currently only known for G of rank 1. We prove that sur follows from exactness of the associated oriented chain complex of a coefficient system, when restricted to a local region of the Bruhat-Tits building for G. Our main result gives strong evidence towards this exactness in the case where G=SL_3(K) for K a totally ramified extension of Q_p. We also develop new combinatorial techniques for analysing the geometric realisation of the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building, which are fundamental to the proof of our main result, and which we hope will inspire further investigation in Bruhat-Tits theory.</description>

      <title>Strichartz and dispersive estimates for quantum bouncing ball model: exponential sums and Van der Corput methods in 1d semi-classical Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the one-dimensional semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation on the half-line with a linear potential and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main focus is on establishing improved dispersive and Strichartz estimates for this model, which govern the space-time behavior of solutions. We prove refined Strichartz bounds using Van der Corput-type derivative tests, beating previous known results where Strichartz estimates incur 1/4 losses. Moreover, assuming sharp bounds for certain exponential sums, our results indicate the possibility to reduce these losses further to $1/6 + \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, which would be sharp. We further expect that analogous Strichartz bounds should hold within the Friedlander model domain in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantum algorithm for computing $S$-units and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.</description>

Abstract: For two representations of some local division algebra, congruent modulo $l$, giving rise to two Harris-Taylor local systems on the corresponding Newton strata of the special fiber of a KHT Shimura varieties, we prove that the $l$-torsion of each of their cohomology groups with compact supports are isomorphic, or equivalently the free quotients of each of the cohomology groups are congruent modulo $l$. We then deduce the construction of accurate non tempered automorphic congruences for a similitude group $G/\mathbb Q$ with signature $(1,d-1)$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic rank bounds for abelian varieties over function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new bounds for classical prime-counting functions. All of our bounds are explicit and assume the Riemann Hypothesis. First, we prove that $|\psi(x) - x|$ and $|\vartheta(x) - x|$ are bounded from above by $$\frac{\sqrt{x}\log{x}(\log{x} - \log\log{x})}{8\pi}$$ for all $x\geq 101$ and $x \geq 2\,657$ respectively, where $\psi(x)$ and $\vartheta(x)$ are the Chebyshev $\psi$ and $\vartheta$ functions. Using the extra precision offered by these results, we also prove new explicit descriptions for the error in each of Mertens' theorems which improve earlier bounds by Schoenfeld.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give a better understanding of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification and of the interaction between the two stratifications for a general signature $(q-2,2)$.</description>

Abstract: Druzkowski s reduction of the Jacobian Conjecture gives rise to a class of highly complicated linear equations with polynomial coefficients. We find an unrecorded algebraic identity and apply it as a variant of the Laplace determinant expansion formula to solve such equation in a way analogous to(and no less elegant than) Cramer rule. Three consecutive cases are addressed where the situation upgrades from one case to the next.</description>

      <title>Partition-theoretic model of prime distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that naturally predicts the prime number theorem as well as the twin prime conjecture. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$
  where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)$ is an explicit error term that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error term represent enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error term to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\operatorname{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimates are {\it almost exact}.
  We then perform computational tests of unusual predictions of the model, finding limited evidence of predictable variations in prime gaps.</description>

Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution result for a class of higher step nilflows, called filiform nilflows, and derive bounds on Weyl sums for higher degree polynomials with a power saving comparable to the best known, derived by J. Bourgain, C. Demeter and L. Guth and by T. Wooley from their proof of Vinogradov Main Conjecture. Our argument is based on ideas from dynamical systems (cohomological equations, invariant distributions) and on non-Abelian harmonic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quotient of the Brauer group of a product of varieties over k by the sum of the images of the Brauer groups of factors has finite exponent. The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</description>

      <title>A note on weight filtrations at the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$.
  On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes.
  Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification.
  In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</description>

Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>A few notes on the asymptotic behavior of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</description>
