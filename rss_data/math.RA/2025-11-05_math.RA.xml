      <title>Irreducible L-modules of Modular Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this project is to determine all irreducible modules of a given modular Lie algebra. In contrast to ordinary Lie algebras, modular Lie algebras require an additional structure known as the p-mapping. The minimal p-envelope of a modular Lie algebra is restrictable, and there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the induced modules and certain original modules. By exploiting the properties of induced modules, this project aims to decompose a modular Lie algebra L into irreducible L- modules. Several examples will be presented to demonstrate how such decompositions can be achieved for specific modular Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Classifications of 3-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebras whose point schemes are not integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In noncommutative algebraic geometry, Artin--Tate--Van den Bergh showed that a $3$-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebra $A$ is {\it geometric}. So, we can write $A=\mathcal{A}(E,\sigma)$ where $E$ is $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times \mathbb{P}^{1}$ or curves of bidegree (2,2) in $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times \mathbb{P}^{1}$, and $\sigma\in \mathrm{Aut}_{k}E$. In this paper, for each case that $E$ is either (i) a conic and two lines in a triangle, (ii) a conic and two lines intersecting in one point, or (iii) quadrangle, we give the complete list of defining relations of $A$ and classify them up to graded algebra isomorphisms and graded Morita equivalences in terms of their defining relations. By the results of the second and third authors and our result in this paper, we give classifications of $3$-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebra whose point schemes are not integral.</description>

      <title>Homological and Categorical Foundations of Ternary $\Gamma$-Modules and Their Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a unified homological categorical foundation for commutative ternary Gamma semirings by formulating a general theory of ternary Gamma modules that integrates algebraic, geometric, and computational layers, extending the ideal theoretic and algorithmic bases of Papers A [Rao2025A] and B [Rao2025B1].
  Methods: We axiomatize ternary Gamma modules and establish the fundamental isomorphism theorems, construct annihilator primitive correspondences, and prove Schur density embeddings. Categorical analysis shows that T Gamma Mod is additive, exact, and monoidal closed, enabling the definition of derived functors Ext and Tor via projective injective resolutions and yielding a tensor Hom adjunction. We develop geometric dualities between module objects and the spectrum Spec Gamma (T) and extend them to analytic, fuzzy, and computational settings.
  Results: The category T Gamma Mod admits kernels, cokernels, coequalizers, and balanced exactness; monoidal closure ensures internal Homs and coherent tensor Hom adjunctions. Derived functors Ext and Tor are well defined and functorial, with long exact sequences and base change compatibility. Schur density yields faithful embedding criteria, while annihilator primitive correspondences control primitivity and support theory. Geometric dualities provide contravariant equivalences linking submodule spectra with closed sets in Spec Gamma (T), persisting under analytic, fuzzy, and computational enrichments.
  Conclusion: These results complete the algebraic homological geometric synthesis for commutative ternary Gamma semirings, furnish robust tools for derived and spectral analysis, and prepare the framework for fuzzy and computational extensions developed in Paper D [Rao2025D], extending the algebraic framework first established in [Rao2025]</description>

      <title>Descent Theory for Vertex Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras can be defined over any differential commutative ring. We develop the general descent theory for vertex algebras over such bases. We apply this to the classification of twisted forms of affine and Heisenberg vertex algebras, and to reinterpret and generalize a correspondence of Li.</description>

      <title>Higher hereditary algebras and toric Fano stacks of Picard number one or two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and give a classification of all $d$-tilting bundles (and thus geometric Helices) consisting of line bundles on $d$-dimensional smooth toric Fano DM stacks of Picard number one or two. Here, a $d$-tilting bundle is a tilting bundle whose endomorphism algebra has global dimension $d$ or less.
  In the case of Picard number one, tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in its Picard group equipped with a certain partial order. Moreover, all of them are $d$-tilting bundles and their endomorphisms algebras become $d$-representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Conversely, all such algebras arise in this way. In this sense, we can think of smooth toric Fano DM stacks with Picard number one as geometric models of higher representation infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$. Using this geometric model, we give a new combinatorial description to $d$-APR tilting modules of them.
  In the case of Picard number two, $d$-tilting bundles consisting of line bundles correspond bijectively to pairs $(I,I')$, where $I$ and $I'$ are non-trivial upper sets in certain partially ordered sets. Here, $I$ corresponds to a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of a certain Gorenstein toric singularity with divisor class group of rank one and $I'$ corresponds to a cut of the quiver of this NCCR. Moreover, the endomorphism algebras of these $d$-tilting bundles also become $d$-representation infinite algebras.</description>

      <title>Multipliers, $W$-algebras and the growth of generalized polynomial identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $W$-algebra over a field $F$ of characteristic zero, where $W$ is any $F$-algebra. We develop a comprehensive theory of generalized identities independently on the algebraic structure of $W$, using the multiplier algebra of $A.$ We also characterize the generalized varieties of almost polynomial growth generated by finite dimensional $W$-algebras. Finally, we provide a counter-example to the Specht property of generalized $T_W$-ideals in characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases of Rota-Baxter algebra of weight $\lambda$ with spectrum lying in $\{0,-\lambda\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that if $A$ is a finite-dimensional unital algebra equipped with a Rota-Baxter operator $R$ of weight $\lambda$, then spectrum of $R$ is a subset of $\{0,-\lambda\}$. We are interested on finding all consequences of the Rota-Baxter relation and the relation of the form $R^k(R+\lambda{\rm id})^l = 0$. In 2024, H.~Qiu, S. Zheng, Y. Dan solved this problem for $k = l = 1$ and $\lambda\neq0$. We find a Gr\"obner-Shirshov basis of the ideal generated by these two relations in general case.</description>

      <title>Reynolds Lie bialgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a bialgebra theory for Reynolds Lie algebras. First we introduce the notion of a quadratic Reynolds Lie algebra and show that it induces an isomorphism from the adjoint representation to the coadjoint representation. Then we introduce the notion of matched pairs, Manin triples and bialgebras for Reynolds Lie algebras, and show that Manin triples, bialgebras and certain matched pairs of Reynolds Lie algebras are equivalent. In particular, we introduce the notion of a Reynolds operator on a quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebra which can induce a Reynolds Lie bialgebra naturally. Finally, we introduce the notion of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Reynolds Lie algebra whose solutions give rise to Reynolds Lie bialgebras. We also introduce the notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators on a Reynolds Lie algebra and Reynolds pre-Lie algebras, and construct solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in terms of relative Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds pre-Lie algebras.</description>
