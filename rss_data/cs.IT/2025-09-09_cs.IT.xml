      <title>Multiport Network Modeling and Optimization for Reconfigurable Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable pinching-antenna system (PASS) is presented, endowing pinching antennas (PAs) with both amplitude- and phase-controllable radiation beyond conventional implementations. To characterize this feature, a general and physically consistent model is established for PASS via multiport network theory. Within this model, the fundamental constraint of ideal reconfigurability of PAs is identified, allowing the full control of signal amplitudes and phases. A practical directional-coupler (DC)-based PA model is then proposed, enabling both amplitude-only control and amplitude-constrained phase control. Beamforming optimization is investigated for both ideal and practical cases: an optimal solution is obtained for ideal PAs, whereas a high-quality iterative algorithm is developed for DC-based PAs. Numerical results suggest that in single-user scenarios: (i) with optimized PA positions, performance gains arise primarily from amplitude reconfigurability and DC-based PAs approach ideal performance, and (ii) with fixed PA positions, both amplitude and phase reconfigurability are critical and DC-based PAs incur non-negligible loss.</description>

      <title>Study of Iterative Detection, Decoding and Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an iterative detection, decoding and channel estimation scheme for multiple-antenna systems assisted by multiple reflective intelligent surfaces (RIS). A novel channel estimation technique that exploits low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and iterative processing is developed to enhance estimation accuracy while reducing the number of required pilot symbols. The key idea is to exploit encoded pilots to improve the iterative process, enabling the use of not only pilot bits but also parity bits from the coded packet to refine channel estimation. Simulations analyze a sub-6 GHz scenario where the channel propagation is not sparse and multiple RIS are deployed, considering both LOS and NLOS conditions. Numerical results show significant performance gains for the proposed scheme and estimator over competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal IRS Aided OFDM: Rate Maximization under Frequency-Dependent Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system aided by a beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS), where inter-connections exist among different elements such that the reflection matrix can exhibit a beyond diagonal structure. Under practical circuit structures, the reflection matrix of the BD-IRS is generally dependent on the circuit parameters (e.g., capacitance matrix for all tunable capacitors) as well as the operating frequency, which leads to couplings among the BD-IRS reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and consequently new challenges in the BD-IRS design. Motivated by this, we first model the relationship between the BD-IRS reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and the tunable capacitance matrix, and then formulate the joint optimization problem of the tunable capacitance matrix and power allocation over OFDM sub-carriers to maximize the achievable rate of the OFDM system. Despite the non-convexity of the problem, we propose an effective algorithm for finding a high-quality feasible solution via leveraging alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark designs.</description>

      <title>Trace Repair Never Loses to Classical Repair: Exact and Explicit Helper Nodes Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the repair of Reed--Solomon codes over $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{B}^t$ using traces over $\mathbb{B}$. Building on the trace framework of Guruswami--Wootters (2017), recent work of Liu--Wan--Xing (2024) reduced repair bandwidth by studying a related subspace $\mathcal{W}_k$. In this work, we determine the dimension of $\mathcal{W}_k$ exactly using cyclotomic cosets and provide an explicit set of helper nodes that attains bandwidth $(n-d-1)\log |\mathbb{B}|$ bits with $d=\text{dim}(\mathcal{W}_k)$. Moreover, we show that $(n-d-1)\le kt$, and so, trace repair never loses to the classical repair.</description>

      <title>On catastrophicity of convolutional codes and their encoders over $\Z_{p^r}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of minimal $p$-encoders for convolutional codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$, where $p$ is a prime. This addresses a conjecture from \cite{k}, which posits that every such code admits a minimal $p$-encoder, implying that all convolutional codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ are noncatastrophic when input sequences are restricted to coefficients in $\{0, \dots, p-1\}$. Our contributions include the introduction of a new polynomial invariant that characterizes free codes, which enables us to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a free code over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ to be noncatastrophic in the usual sense (where input coefficients are from $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$). Based on these findings, we affirm the conjecture by providing a constructive method for obtaining a minimal $p$-encoder for any convolutional code over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Transpositions of Consecutive Symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of correcting transpositions (or swaps) of consecutive symbols in $ q $-ary strings is studied. A family of codes correcting a transposition at an arbitrary location is described and proved to have asymptotically optimal redundancy. Additionally, an improved construction is given over a binary alphabet. Bounds on the cardinality of codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $ transpositions are obtained. A lower bound on the achievable asymptotic rate of optimal codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions is derived. Finally, a construction of codes correcting all possible patterns of transpositions is presented, and the corresponding lower bound on the zero-error capacity of the $ q $-ary transposition channel is stated.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes over Three-Node Relay Networks with Burst Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates streaming codes over three-node relay networks under burst packet erasures with a delay constraint $T$. In any sliding window of $T+1$ consecutive packets, the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels may introduce burst erasures of lengths at most $b_1$ and $b_2$, respectively. Singhvi et al. proposed a construction achieving the optimal code rate when $\max\{b_1,b_2\}\mid (T-b_1-b_2)$. We construct streaming codes with the optimal rate under the condition
  $T\geq b_1+b_2+\frac{b_1b_2}{|b_1-b_2|}$, thereby enriching the family of rate-optimal streaming codes for three-node relay networks.</description>

      <title>Row-Column Twisted Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a new class of codes known as row-column twisted Reed-Solomon codes (abbreviated as RCTRS), motivated by the works of \cite{beelen2017twisted} and \cite{liu2025column}. We explicitly provide conditions for such codes to be MDS and also ensure their existence. By determining the dimensions of their Schur squares, we prove that these MDS codes are not equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes, thus presenting a new family of non-RS MDS codes. Additionally, we prove that these MDS codes are also not equivalent to column twisted Reed-Solomon codes described in \cite{liu2025column}, showing the novelty of our construction.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sensor Allocation for Inverse Problems of Detecting Sparse Leaking Emission Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse optimal allocation of sensors for detecting sparse leaking emission sources. Because of the non-negativity of emission rates, uncertainty associated with parameters in the forward model, and sparsity of leaking emission sources, the classical linear Gaussian Bayesian inversion setup is limited and no closed-form solutions are available. By incorporating the non-negativity constraints on emission rates, relaxing the Gaussian distributional assumption, and considering the parameter uncertainties associated with the forward model, this paper provides comprehensive investigations, technical details, in-depth discussions and implementation of the optimal sensor allocation problem leveraging a bilevel optimization framework. The upper-level problem determines the optimal sensor locations by minimizing the Integrated Mean Squared Error (IMSE) of the estimated emission rates over uncertain wind conditions, while the lower-level problem solves an inverse problem that estimates the emission rates. Two algorithms, including the repeated Sample Average Approximation (rSAA) and the Stochastic Gradient Descent based bilevel approximation (SBA), are thoroughly investigated. It is shown that the proposed approach can further reduce the IMSE of the estimated emission rates starting from various initial sensor deployment generated by existing approaches. Convergence analysis is performed to obtain the performance guarantee, and numerical investigations show that the proposed approach can allocate sensors according to the parameters and output of the forward model. Computationally efficient code with GPU acceleration is available on GitHub so that the approach readily applicable.</description>

      <title>Ground state energies of multipartite $p$-spin models -- partially lifted RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ground state energies (GSE) of multipartite $p$-spin models. Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other.</description>

      <title>Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Moments of finitary factor maps between Bernoulli processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of what moments can exist for the coding radius of a finitary map between two i.i.d. processes, has been extensively studied in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$-processes. Here we treat this problem for factor maps between $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-processes ($d&gt;1$). By modeling the homomorphism with a map between spaces of finite sequences, we extend Harvey and Peres' result, showing that for a finitary homomorphism between two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, if the coding radius of the map has a finite $\frac{d}{2}$-moment, then the two processes share the same informational variance. We use our modeling technique to prove a "Schmidt-type theorem" - that in case the above homomorphism has a coding radius of exponential tails, then the two processes are essentially the same. This result appears to be new even for the one-dimensional case, addressing a question of Angel and Spinka.</description>

      <title>On the recognition problem for limits of entropy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no algorithm to decide whether a given integer vector is in the closure of the entropic cone $\overline{\Gamma_{n}^{*}}$. Equivalently, there is no decision procedure to determine whether a given integer-valued function $h:\mathcal{P}(\{1,\ldots,n\})\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ is a pointwise limit of joint entropy functions. In other words, given such an $h$, it is undecidable whether for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a finite probability space $(\Omega,P)$ with random variables $X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}$ such that their joint entropy $H$ satisfies $\max_{I\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}}\left|H\left(X_{I}\right)-h\left(I\right)\right|&lt;\varepsilon$. This settles the last open case in a sequence of related undecidability results proved by L. K\"{u}hne and the author, with applications in algorithmic information theory. The main new tool is a Desargues'-type theorem for almost entropic polymatroids.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Decoding of Biased-Tailored Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout, which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from 1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8 percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.</description>

      <title>On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian. To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original (unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve the same performance while requiring less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. The key contributions of this work include the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs, and a distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Group Testing and Pooled Data in the Linear Regime with Sublinear Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items $p$. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ($\Theta(\frac{p}{\log p})$ tests), there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in $p$, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03113v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate codes designed to correct two bursts of deletions, where each burst has a length of exactly $b$, where $b&gt;1$. The previous best construction, achieved through the syndrome compression technique, had a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$ bits. In contrast, our work introduces a novel approach for constructing $q$-ary codes that attain a redundancy of at most $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits for all $b&gt;1$ and $q\ge2$. Additionally, for the case where $b=1$, we present a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with a redundancy of $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, for all $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Reed-Solomon Codes Against Insertions and Deletions: Full-Length and Rate-$1/2$ Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of Reed--Solomon codes (RS codes, for short) in the presence of insertion and deletion errors has attracted growing attention in recent literature. In this work, we further study this intriguing mathematical problem, focusing on two regimes. First, we study the question of how well full-length RS codes perform against insertions and deletions. For 2-dimensional RS codes, we provide a complete characterization of codes that cannot correct even a single insertion or deletion. Furthermore, we prove that for sufficiently large field size~$q$, nearly all full-length $2$-dimensional RS codes can correct up to $(1 - \delta)q$ insertion and deletion errors for any $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. Extending beyond the 2-dimensional case, we show that for any $k \ge 2$, there exists a full-length $k$-dimensional RS code capable of correcting $q / (10k)$ insertion and deletion errors, provided $q$ is large enough. Second, we focus on rate $1/2$ RS codes that can correct a single insertion or deletion error. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that constructs such codes over fields of size $q = \Theta(k^4)$. This result matches the existential bound given in \cite{con2023reed}.</description>

      <title>Base Station Placement Optimization for Networked Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations (BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional (3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.</description>

Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in antenna design, offering enhanced spatial degrees of freedom through dynamic reconfigurability. By exploiting spatial flexibility, FAS can adapt to varying channel conditions and optimize wireless performance, making it a highly promising candidate for next-generation communication networks. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements. The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>The Curious Price of Distributional Robustness in Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates model robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce the sim-to-real gap in practice. We adopt the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), aimed at learning a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance when the deployed environment falls within a prescribed uncertainty set around the nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs remained mostly unsettled regardless of the uncertainty set in use. It was unclear if distributional robustness bears any statistical consequences when benchmarked against standard RL. Assuming access to a generative model that draws samples based on the nominal MDP, we provide a near-optimal characterization of the sample complexity of RMDPs when the uncertainty set is specified via either the total variation (TV) distance or chi-squared divergence. The algorithm studied here is a model-based method called distributionally robust value iteration, which is shown to be near-optimal for the full range of uncertainty levels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results uncover that RMDPs are not necessarily easier or harder to learn than standard MDPs. The statistical consequence incurred by the robustness requirement depends heavily on the size and shape of the uncertainty set: in the case w.r.t.~the TV distance, the minimax sample complexity of RMDPs is always smaller than that of standard MDPs; in the case w.r.t.~the chi-squared divergence, the sample complexity of RMDPs far exceeds the standard MDP counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</description>

      <title>UNILoc: Unified Localization Combining Model-Based Geometry and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.</description>

      <title>A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.

      <title>Graded Quantum Codes: From Weighted Algebraic Geometry to Homological Chain Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted heights.The second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors.
  A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon &gt; 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields.
  Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>DSDE: Dynamic Speculative Decoding with KLD Stability for Real-World Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation length adaptation.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Rate Bounds and Constellation Shaping under Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed noise, composed of white Gaussian noise (WGN) and impulsive noise (IN), appears in numerous communication scenarios and can severely degrade system performance. In this paper, we optimize the transmitted constellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff rate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we derive its corresponding baseband representation. Then, the baseband model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds of the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient bounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These bounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation points in both geometric positions and probabilistic distributions. The projected gradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the convergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a significant rate improvement compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Insights from Gradient Dynamics: Gradient Autoscaled Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification, stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide insights for future optimization research.</description>

      <title>An information metric for comparing and assessing informative interim decisions in sequential clinical trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group sequential designs enable interim analyses and potential early stopping for efficacy or futility. While these adaptations improve trial efficiency and ethical considerations, they also introduce bias into the adapted analyses. We demonstrate how failing to account for informative interim decisions in the analysis can substantially affect posterior estimates of the treatment effect, often resulting in overly optimistic credible intervals aligned with the stopping decision. Drawing on information theory, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify this distortion and highlight its use for post-hoc evaluation of informative interim decisions, with a focus on end-of-study inference. Unlike pointwise comparisons, this measure provides an integrated summary of this distortion on the whole parameter space. By comparing alternative decision boundaries and prior specifications, we illustrate how this measure can improve the understanding of trial results and inform the planning of future adaptive studies. We also introduce an expected version of this metric to support clinicians in choosing decision boundaries. This guidance complements traditional strategies based on type-I error rate control by offering insights into the distortion introduced to the treatment effect at each interim phase. The use of this pre-experimental measure is finally illustrated in a group sequential trial for evaluating a treatment for central nervous system disorders.</description>
