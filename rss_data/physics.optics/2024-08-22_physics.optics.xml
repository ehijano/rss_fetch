      <title>Coherent all X-ray four wave mixing at core shell resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave mixing in the X-ray range can provide valuable insights into the structural and electron dynamics of atomic and molecular systems on ultrafast time scales, with state- and site-selectivity and atomic resolution. This promising experimental toolbox was so far limited by requiring at least one near-visible laser, thus preventing core-shell two-dimensional X-ray spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of background-free all-X-ray four-wave mixing (XFWM) signals from a dilute gaseous sample (Ne). The measured and simulated two-dimensional spectral maps ($\omega_{\text{in}},\omega_{\text{out}}$) show multiple contributions involving the coherent response from core electrons. Notably, two-color resonant XFWM signals, essential for generalized multi-color schemes that allow to locally probe the electronic excitation of matter, are observed in neutral Ne. Moreover, stimulated Ne$^+$ emission in each of the propagating X-ray pulses leads to an increase of the temporal coherence in a narrow-bandwidth, which results in the coherent mixing of three X-ray lasers. Preliminary X-ray excitation experiments making use of multi-color time-delayed X-ray pulses demonstrate temporal resolution capability and show a time dependency consistent with a signal dominated by resonant XFWM processes. This first all-X-ray four-wave-mixing approach represents a major breakthrough towards multidimensional X-ray correlation spectroscopy and the general application of nonlinear all-X-ray wave-mixing.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Cauchy-Riemann Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the evolution of a paraxial beam propagating in free space when its initial transverse structure is characterized by an asymmetric Gaussian modulation combined with an entire function. Utilizing a quantum optics operator approach, our study specifically examines the effects of parameter variations within the Gaussian modulation on two entire functions: the Bessel function and the Airy function. Through this investigation, we aim to elucidate how these parameter variations influence the beam's propagation dynamics and the role played by the asymmetry of the Gaussian modulation in the propagation of such paraxial beams. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive method for computing the propagated field under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Determining van der Waals materials' optical and polaritonic properties using cryogenic FTIR micro-spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van-der-Waals materials have been shown to support numerous exotic polaritonic phenomena originating from their layered structures and associated vibrational and electronic properties. This includes emergent polaritonic phenomena, including hyperbolicity and exciton-polariton formation. However, many van-der-Waals materials' unique properties are most prominent at cryogenic temperatures. This presents a particular challenge for polaritonics research, as reliable optical constant data is required for understanding light-matter coupling. For infrared polaritonics (3-100um), the small size of exfoliated flakes makes conventional ellipsometry impossible. This paper presents a cryogenic Fourier transform infrared microscope design constructed entirely from off-the-shelf components and fitting procedures for determining optical constants. We use this microscope to present the first temperature-dependent characterization of the optical properties of hexagonal boron nitride grown with isotopically pure boron. We show that Fabry Perot-type resonances close to the transverse optical phonon show the key temperature-dependent tuning of several parameters. Our full analysis of the infrared dielectric function shows small but significant tuning of the optical constants, which is highly consistent with Raman data from the literature. We then use this dielectric data to perform and analyze the polariton propagation properties, which agree extremely well with published cryogenic scattering-type nearfield microscopy results. In addition to the insights gained into hyperbolic polaritons in hBN, our paper represents a transferable framework for characterizing exfoliated infrared polaritonic materials and other infrared devices. This could accelerate discoveries in other material systems, especially those that are spatially inhomogeneous or cannot be prepared as large single crystals.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling for Optical Vortex Generation in van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam has attracted significant attention across diverse applications, including optical manipulation, phase-contrast microscopy, optical communication, and quantum photonics. To utilize vortex generators for integrated photonics, researchers have developed ultra-compact vortex generators using fork gratings, metasurfaces, and integrated microcombs. However, those devices depend on costly, time-consuming nanofabrication and are constrained by the low signal-to-noise ratio due to the fabrication error. As an alternative maneuver, spin-orbit coupling has emerged as a method to obtain the vortex beam by converting spin angular momentum (SAM) without nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an optical vortex beam using van der Waals (vdW) materials. The significantly high birefringence of vdW materials allows generations of optical vortex beams with high efficiency in a sub-wavelength thickness. In this work, we utilize an 8-um-thick hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal for the creation of optical vortices carrying topological charges of +2 and -2. We also present the generation of an optical vortex beam in a 320-nm-thick MoS2 crystal with a conversion efficiency of 0.09. This study paves the way for fabrication-less and ultra-compact optical vortex generators, which can be applied for integrated photonics and large-scale vortex generator arrays.</description>

      <title>Strong optomechanical coupling between an optically levitated particle and an ultrahigh Q optical microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the dynamics of an optically levitated dielectric micro- and nanoparticle is an exciting new subject in quantum science. Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in attaining quantum-limited optical detection and control of a nanoscale particle by coupling its motion to a high-finesse optical cavity in the resolved-sideband regime. In order to control the particle deeper in the quantum regime, however, it is necessary to significantly enhance the coupling between the particle and the cavity. Here, we present a novel platform that can allow for achieving this. Our system consists of a conventional optical tweezer and a toroidal optical microcavity with an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor. The optomechanical coupling between the particle and the cavity is established by placing the particle in the near field of the cavity. The significantly reduced mode volume allows us to achieve a 100-fold increase in the single photon optomechanical coupling compared to a conventional Fabry-P\'erot cavity with macroscopic mirrors, while ultralow loss of the cavity maintains the system close to the resolved-sideband regime. Our approach paves the way for enabling quantum experiments on levitated mesoscopic particles with high quantum cooperativity near the resolved-sideband regime.</description>

      <title>Core-Shell Nanoparticle Resonances in Near-Field Microscopy Revealed by Fourier-demodulated Full-wave Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the near-field optical response of core-shell nanoparticles using Fourier-demodulated full-wave simulations, revealing significant modifications to established contrast mechanisms in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Our work examines the complex interplay of geometrical and optical resonances within core-shell structures. Using a finite element method (FEM) simulation closely aligned with the actual s-SNOM measurement processes, we capture the specific near-field responses in these nanostructures. Our findings show that core-shell nanoparticles exhibit unexpected distinct resonance shifts and massively enhanced scattering driven by both core and shell properties. This investigation not only advances the understanding of near-field interactions in complex nanosystems but also provides a refined theoretical framework to accurately predict the optical signatures of nanostructures with internal heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Cartesian and spherical multipole expansions in anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipole expansion, a ubiquitous tool in a variety of physical problems, can be formulated in spherical and Cartesian coordinates. By constructing an explicit map linking both formulations in isotropic media, we discover a lack of equivalence between both approaches in anisotropic media. In isotropic media, the Cartesian multipole tensor can be reduced to a spherical tensor containing significantly fewer entries. In anisotropic media, however, the loss of propagation symmetry prevents this reduction. In turn, non-harmonic sources radiate fields that can be projected onto a finite set of Cartesian multipole moments but require (possibly infinitely) many spherical moments. For harmonic sources, the link between both approaches presents a systematic way to construct the spherical multipole expansion from the Cartesian one. The lack of equivalence between both approaches results in physically significant effects wherever the field propagation includes the Laplace operator. We illustrate this issue on an electromagnetic radiation inverse problem in anisotropic media, including an analysis of a large-anisotropy regime. We show that the use of the Cartesian approach significantly increases the efficiency and interpretability of the model. The proposed approach opens the door to wider applications of the multipole expansion in anisotropic media, whose importance is rising in multiple physical systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating high-precision and fringe-scale displacement sensing using heterodyne cavity-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $130 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $23 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>

      <title>Long-Propagating Ghost Phonon Polaritons Enabled by Selective Mode Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise control of phonon polaritons(PhPs) is essential for advancements in nanophotonic applications like on-chip optical communication and quantum information processing. Ghost hyperbolic phonon polaritons (g-HPs), which have been recently discovered, feature in-plane hyperbolic dispersion and oblique wavefronts, enabling long-range propagation. Despite their potential, controlling the directionality and selective excitation of g-HPs remains challenging. Our research demonstrates that modifying the shape of the launching micro/nano antenna can achieve this control. Using an asymmetric triangular gold antenna on a calcite crystal surface, we achieve highly directional g-HP excitation by selectively targeting specific polariton modes. Additionally, the mode of g-HPs can be adjusted by changing the excitation wavelength or rotating the antenna. Remarkably, our near-field imaging experiments show g-HP propagation over distances exceeding 35 micrometers, more than twice the length reported in previous studies. This work merges g-HP theory with structural engineering, enhancing the control over g-HPs and paving the way for innovative applications in mid-IR optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>HDN:Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration depth of ultrasonic imaging, showing great potential in cerebrovascular disease detection. However, the ultrasonic wave suffers strong attenuation and multi-scattering when it passes through the skull tissue, resulting in the distortion of the collected photoacoustic (PA) signal. In this paper, inspired by the principles of deep learning and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, we propose an image reconstruction framework named HDN (Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight), which consists of the signal extraction part and difference utilization part. The signal extraction part is used to correct the distorted signal and reconstruct an initial image. The difference utilization part is used to make further use of the signal difference between the distorted signal and corrected signal, reconstructing the residual image between the initial image and the target image. The test results on a PA digital brain simulation dataset show that compared with the traditional delay-and-sum (DAS) method and deep-learning-based method, HDN achieved superior performance in both signal correction and image reconstruction. Specifically for the SSIM index, the HDN reached 0.606 in imaging results, compared to 0.154 for the DAS method and 0.307 for the deep-learning-based method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two descriptions are introduced and analyzed for a reflectivity estimation and detection scheme that does not involve measurement of photons scattered by the target. One description, provided by the Hamiltonian dynamics of the full transmitter/receiver optical system, incurs an exponential cost in transmitter intensity for a given estimation sensitivity but is linearly improved with the intensity of the thermal background. The other description, based on optical quantum circuits, exhibits sensitivity around a factor of 1/2 of the optimal entanglement-assisted scheme, but incurs an inverse linear reduction in sensitivity with increasing thermal background. The results have applications for the design of optically active receivers based on combining echo-seeded spontaneous parametric downconversion and induced coherence due to photon indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic emission from a line of atoms interacting with a resonant plane surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband non-degenerate guided-wave bi-photon source in the near and mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest applications in ultrafast quantum metrology require bright, broadband bi-photon sources with one of the photons in the mid-infrared and the other in the visible to near infrared. However, existing sources based on bulk crystals are limited in brightness due to the short interaction length and only allow for limited dispersion engineering. Here, we present an integrated PDC source based on a Ti:LiNbO$_3$ waveguide that generates broadband bi-photons with central wavelengths at $860\,\mathrm{nm}$ and $2800\,\mathrm{nm}$. Their spectral bandwidth exceeds $25\,\mathrm{THz}$ and is achieved by simultaneous matching of the group velocities and cancellation of group velocity dispersion for the signal and idler field. We provide an intuitive understanding of the process by studying our source's behaviour at different temperatures and pump wavelengths, which agrees well with simulations.</description>

      <title>Momentum-entangled two-photon interference for quantum-limited transverse-displacement estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme achieving the ultimate quantum precision for the estimation of the transverse displacement between two interfering photons. Such a transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting properties of the propagation medium, or by the orientation of a system of mirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between polarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta, we show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with a precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the photons. Moreover, we show that for the estimation of small displacements, it is possible to simplify the measurement scheme replacing the transverse-momentum resolving detectors with bucket detectors without any loss in sensitivity. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum interference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at the very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional gallium phosphide optomechanical crystal in the resolved-sideband regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithful quantum state transfer between telecom photons and microwave frequency mechanical oscillations necessitate a fast conversion rate and low thermal noise. Two-dimensional (2D) optomechanical crystals (OMCs) are favorable candidates that satisfy those requirements. 2D OMCs enable sufficiently high mechanical frequency (1$\sim$10 GHz) to make the resolved-sideband regime achievable, a prerequisite for many quantum protocols. It also supports higher thermal conductance than 1D structures, mitigating the parasitic laser absorption heating. Furthermore, gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material choice thanks to its large electronic bandgap of 2.26 eV, which suppresses two-photon absorption, and high refractive index $n$ = 3.05 at the telecom C-band, leading to a high-$Q$ optical mode. Here, we fabricate and characterize a 2D OMC made of GaP. We realize a high optical $Q$-factor of $7.9\times 10^{4}$, corresponding to a linewidth $\kappa/2\pi$ = 2.5 GHz at the telecom frequency 195.6 THz. This optical mode couples to several mechanical modes, whose frequencies all exceed the cavity linewidth. The most strongly coupled mode oscillates at 7.7 GHz, more than 3 times the optical linewidth, while achieving a substantial vacuum optomechanical coupling rate $g_{\mathrm{0}}/2\pi$ = 450 kHz. This makes the platform a promising candidate for a long-lived, deterministic quantum memory for telecom photons at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Performance estimation of photonic integrated wavefront corrector for single-mode fiber coupling</title>

Abstract: Many modern astronomical instruments rely on the optimal coupling of starlight into single-mode fibers (SMFs). For ground-based telescopes, this coupling is limited by atmospheric turbulence. We propose an integrated wavefront corrector based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics, which samples the aberrated wavefront via a microlens array (MLA). The MLA focuses the sampled wavefront onto an array of grating couplers that inject the beamlets into the single-mode waveguides of the corrector. The beams in each waveguide are then shifted in phase using thermo-optic phase shifters before combining the co-phased beams into one single-mode waveguide. In this work, we analyze the external factors that we anticipate will impact the performance of the corrector. Specifically, we study the effects of the telescope pupil function with obscuration, determine whether the corrector requires tip/tilt pre-correction, and analyze the impact of scintillation on the correction quality.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescent cooling with incoherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical refrigeration using anti-Stokes photoluminescence is now well established, especially for rare-earth-doped solids where cooling to cryogenic temperatures has recently been achieved. The cooling efficiency of optical refrigeration is constrained by the requirement that the increase in entropy of the photon field must be greater than the decrease in entropy of the sample. Laser radiation has been used in all demonstrated cases of optical refrigeration with the intention of minimizing the entropy of the absorbed photons. Here, we show that as long as the incident radiation is unidirectional, the loss of coherence does not significantly affect the cooling efficiency. Using a general formulation of radiation entropy as the von Neumann entropy of the photon field, we show how the cooling efficiency depends on the properties of the light source such as wavelength, coherence, and directionality. Our results suggest that the laws of thermodynamics permit optical cooling of materials with incoherent sources such as light emitting diodes and filtered sunlight almost as efficiently as with lasers. Our findings have significant and immediate implications for design of compact, all-solid-state devices cooled via optical refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Mean-chiral displacement in coherently driven photonic lattices and its application to synthetic frequency dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing topologically nontrivial photonic lattices by measuring their topological invariants is crucial in topological photonics. In conservative one-dimensional systems, a widely used observable to extract the winding number is the mean-chiral displacement. In many realistic photonic systems, however, losses can hardly be avoided, and little is known on how one can extend the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context. Here we theoretically propose an experimentally viable method to directly detect the topological winding number of one-dimensional chiral photonic lattices. The method we propose is a generalization of the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context with coherent illumination. By integrating the mean-chiral displacement of the steady state over the pump light frequency, one can obtain the winding number with a correction of the order of the loss rate squared. We demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to lattices along synthetic frequency dimensions.</description>

      <title>Young double-slit interference with single hard x-ray photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young double-slit experiments using monochromatic hard X-rays with the energy of 25 keV are presented. The experiments were performed at a synchrotron source with a distance of 110 m between the interferometer and the detector to produce an interference pattern with a sufficiently broad period that could be adequately sampled by a photon-counting detector with 75 micrometre pixels. In the single-particle version of the experiment, over one million image frames with a single registered photon in each one were collected. The sum of these frames showed a clear presence of the interference pattern with the expected period. Subsequent analysis provided an objective estimation of the minimal number of detected photons required to determine, in accordance with the Rose criterion, the presence of the photon interference. Apart from a general theoretical interest, these investigations were aimed at exploring the possibility of medical X-ray phase-contrast imaging in photon-counting mode at minimal radiation doses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a promising approach to programmable photonics thanks to their nonvolatile, reversible phase transitions and high refractive index contrast. However, conventional designs are limited by global phase control over entire PCM thin films between fully amorphous and fully crystalline states, which restricts device functionality and confines design flexibility and programmability. In this work, we present a novel approach that leverages pixel-level control of PCM in inverse-designed photonic devices, enabling highly reconfigurable, multi-functional operations. We integrate low-loss Sb2Se3 onto a multi-mode interferometer (MMI) and achieve precise, localized phase manipulation through direct laser writing. This technique allows for flexible programming of the photonic device by adjusting the PCM phase pattern rather than relying on global phase states, thereby enhancing device adaptability. As a proof of concept, we programmed the device as a wavelength-division multiplexer and subsequently reconfigured it into a mode-division multiplexer. Our results underscore the potential of combining inverse design with pixel-wise tuning for next-generation programmable phase-change photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Spatiotemporal Pattern Formation in Photonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of time varying photonic media with an optical Kerr nonlinearity and an associated phase transition. The interplay between a periodically modulated permittivity and the nonlinearity induces a continuous transition of electromagnetic waves to a state with broken spatial and time translation symmetries. This transition gives rise to a lattice-like wave pattern, in many ways similar to a spatial crystallization in solids. Symmetry breaking triggers the emergence of soft, Goldstone-like modes, which propagate as deformations of the lattice structure, as well as massive Higgs-like modes -- spatially uniform oscillations of the field amplitude. We extend the analysis of the non-equlibrium symmetry breaking to 2+1 dimensional time varying media and discuss pattern formation as well as the connection to discrete dissipative time crystals.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Beam Profiles from Silicon Photonics Gratings using Transformer Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coupled nanolasers near exceptional points for directional emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring the losses of optical systems within the frame of non-Hermitian physics has appeared very fruitful in the last few years. In particular, the description of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators have become widespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is highly significant for integrated nanophotonics, but requires fine control techniques of the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional emission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated waveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency- and loss-couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to reach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of nanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to unidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.</description>

      <title>Edge-dependent anomalous topology in synthetic photonic lattices subject to discrete step walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous topological phases, where edge states coexist with topologically trivial Chern bands, can only appear in periodically driven lattices. When the driving is smooth and continuous, the bulk-edge correspondence is guaranteed by the existence of a bulk invariant known as the winding number. However, in lattices subject to periodic discrete-step walks the existence of edge states does not only depend on bulk invariants but also on the boundary. This is a consequence of the absence of an intrinsic time-dependence or micromotion in discrete-step walks. We report the observation of edge states and a simultaneous measurement of the bulk invariants in anomalous topological phases in a two-dimensional synthetic photonic lattice subject to discrete-step walks. The lattice is implemented using time multiplexing of light pulses in two coupled fibre rings, in which one of the dimensions displays real space dynamics and the other one is parametric. The presence of edge states is inherent to the periodic driving and depends on the properties of the boundary in the implemented two-band model with zero Chern number. We provide a suitable expression for the topological invariants whose calculation does not rely on micromotion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent edge states in two-dimensional Dirac materials with a flat band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of spin-dependent quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D) pseudospin-1/2 Dirac materials leading to a relativistic quantum chimera was recently uncovered. We investigate spin-dependent Dirac electron optics in 2D pseudospin-1 Dirac materials, where the energy-band structure consists of a pair of Dirac cones and a flat band. In particular, with a suitable combination of external electric fields and a magnetic exchange field, electrons with a specific spin orientation (e.g., spin-down) can be trapped in a class of long-lived edge modes, generating resonant scattering. The spin-dependent edge states are a unique feature of flat-band Dirac materials and have no classical correspondence. However, electrons with the opposite spin (i.e., spin up) undergo conventional quantum scattering with a classical correspondence, which can be understood in the framework of Dirac electron optics. A consequence is that the spin-down electrons produce a large scattering probability with broad scattering angle distribution in both near- and far-field regions, while the spin-up electrons display the opposite behavior. Such characteristically different behaviors of the electrons with opposite spins lead to spin polarization that can be as high as nearly 100%.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues</title>

Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>
