      <title>Student explanation in middle and secondary mathematics and statistics: A scoping literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This scoping review examines the literature on student explanation strategies in middle and secondary mathematics and statistics education from 2014 to 2024. Following the PRISMA protocol, we analyzed 41 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The findings classify student explanations into two types: self-explanation (SE) and peer explanation (PE). Both approaches enhance conceptual understanding and procedural knowledge, though each offers distinct benefits and challenges. SE is particularly effective when combined with worked examples and varies with prompting strategies, while PE significantly impacts students' affective development and social learning. The review identifies a significant gap in studies comparing the effectiveness of SE and PE, alongside an almost complete absence of research within statistics education.</description>

      <title>Exploring collaboration: The effect of gender on mathematics learning preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of gender on students' collaborative preferences for learning mathematics (CPLM) over time in an undergraduate mathematics context. Data collected at three points during the semester were analyzed using a two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results showed no significant interaction between gender and time, nor a main effect of gender, indicating stable CPLM scores and comparable preferences between male and female students. These findings challenge prior research on gendered differences in collaboration and suggest that further exploration of contextual factors is needed to deepen understanding of CPLM in undergraduate mathematics education.</description>

      <title>Mathematics education research must be useful for the classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theme of the PME-48 conference, Making sure that mathematics education research reaches the classroom, highlights a key concern: not all mathematics education research informs classroom practice. This raises several fundamental questions: Which research fails to reach the classroom? Why? And should all research be expected to do so? Accordingly, it is fitting that the plenary panel engages with these important issues by debating the following motion: Mathematics education research must be useful for the classroom. This paper presents the debate as structured for the purposes of this publication. Following an introduction, Anthony Essien and Salome Martinez Salazar argue against the motion, while Maitree Inprasitha and Demetra Pitta-Pantazi argue in support. We hope that this debate will stimulate ongoing dialogue and encourage the mathematics education research community to critically engage with this issue - one that is central to the relevance and impact of research in the field.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Motions, Vol. I: Mechanics as Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a group-theoretic interpretation of the historical evolution of mechanics, proposing that each fundamental theory of motion corresponds to a distinct geometry in the sense of Felix Klein. The character of each geometry is uniquely determined by its Inertia Group-the group of spacetime transformations that preserves its privileged class of inertial motions. We trace the three major epistemological ruptures in the history of mechanics by translating foundational physical principles into the unambiguous language of group theory. The analysis begins with Aristotelian mechanics, where absolute Space and Time are shown to be homogeneous spaces of the Group of Aristotle, defined by its preservation of rest. The second rupture, driven by the relativity of motion (Bruno, Galileo), leads to the abandonment of absolute Space and the construction of the Galilean Group, which preserves the class of uniform rectilinear motions. The final rupture, precipitated by the crisis in electromagnetism, results in the dissolution of absolute Time and the emergence of the Poincar\'e Group, preserving affine lines and the Minkowski metric. Central results of this approach are theorems demonstrating, with mathematical certainty, the non-existence of a Galilean-invariant "Space" and a Poincar\'e-invariant "Time," where invariance is defined with respect to the action of the corresponding inertia group. This geometric framework provides a unified perspective on the transition from classical to modern physics and allows for a rigorous distinction between 'primary' epistemological ruptures, which alter the Inertia Group itself, and 'secondary' ruptures, which introduce new formalisms for the management of dynamics within a stable geometry.</description>
