      <title>Magnetoresistance oscillations in vertical junctions of 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) oscillations serve as a hallmark of intrinsic quantum behavior, traditionally observed only in conducting systems. Here we report the discovery of MR oscillations in an insulating system, the vertical junctions of CrPS$_4$ which is a two dimensional (2D) A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Systematic investigations of MR peaks under varying conditions, including electrode materials, magnetic field direction, temperature, voltage bias and layer number, elucidate a correlation between MR oscillations and spin-canted states in CrPS$_4$. Experimental data and analysis point out the important role of the in-gap electronic states in generating MR oscillations, and we proposed that spin selected interlayer hopping of localized states may be responsible for it. Our findings not only illuminate the unusual electronic transport in CrPS$_4$ but also underscore the potential of van der Waals magnets for exploring interesting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hall signal-dominated microwave transmission through graphene-loaded waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave transmission line spectroscopy is used to observe the integer quantum Hall effect in two samples of monolayer graphene with different geometries that are resistively-coupled to a coplanar waveguide. We find plateaus in transmitted power that do not vary significantly with microwave frequency but are significantly different for two samples due to their shape. With each drop in transmitted power corresponding to an additional quantum Hall edge mode that short the transmission line to ground, these well-known quanta of conductance allow us to calibrate the sensitivity of the devices. One sample with short contact regions matched the sensitivity expected when considering only the quantum Hall conductance of $\nu e^2/h$; another sample with long contact regions demonstrated a nearly three-fold enhancement in sensitivity. We model this result with a purely resistive circuit that introduces an additional resistance to explain the increased sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Scale-tailored localization and its observation in non-Hermitian electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect are two paradigmatic wave localization phenomena, resulting from wave interference and the intrinsic non-Hermitian point gap, respectively. In this study, we unveil a novel localization phenomenon associated with long-range asymmetric coupling, termed scale-tailored localization, where the number of induced localized modes and their localization lengths scale exclusively with the coupling range. We show that the long-range coupling fundamentally reshapes the energy spectra and eigenstates by creating multiple connected paths on the lattice. Furthermore, we present experimental observations of scale-tailored localization in non-Hermitian electrical circuits utilizing adjustable voltage followers and switches. The circuit admittance spectra possess separate point-shaped and loop-shaped components in the complex energy plane, corresponding respectively to skin modes and scale-tailored localized states. Our findings not only expand and deepen the understanding of peculiar effects induced by non-Hermiticity but also offer a feasible experimental platform for exploring and controlling wave localizations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Tunneling Magnetoresistance Oscillation and Electrically Tunable Tunneling Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Few-layer CrPS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets with layer-dependent magnetic states and/or diverse magnetic interactions and anisotropies have attracted extensive research interest. Despite the advances, a notable challenge persists in effectively manipulating the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) of 2D vdW magnet-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we report the novel and anomalous tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) oscillations and pioneering demonstration of bias and gate voltage controllable TAMR in 2D vdw MTJs, utilizing few-layer CrPS4. This material, inherently an antiferromagnet, transitions to a canted magnetic order upon application of external magnetic fields. Through TMR measurements, we unveil the novel, layer-dependent oscillations in the tunneling resistance for few-layer CrPS4 devices under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields, with a pronounced controllability via gate voltage. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that both the polarity and magnitude of TAMR in CrPS4 can be effectively tuned through either a bias or gate voltage. We further elucidate the mechanism behind this electrically tunable TAMR through first-principles calculations. The implications of our findings are far-reaching, providing new insights into 2D magnetism and opening avenues for the development of innovative spintronic devices based on 2D vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Spurious Dots Formation in SiMOS Single Electron Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of spurious dots in SiMOS single-electron transistors (SETs), fabricated on an industrial 300 mm process line, has been statistically analyzed. To have a deeper understanding of the origin of these spurious dots, we analyzed SETs with three different oxide thicknesses: 8 nm, 12 nm and 20 nm. By combining spurious dot triangulation cryo-measurement with simulations of strain, gate bias, and location of the electron wave function, we demonstrate that most spurious dots are formed through the combined effects of strain and gate bias, leading to variations in the conduction band energy. Despite the similar thermal expansion coefficients of polycrystalline silicon gates and single-crystalline silicon substrates, strain remains a crucial factor in spurious dots formation. This learning can be use to optimize the device design and the oxide thickness, to reduce the density of spurious dot while keeping quantum dot tunability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin-Engineering in On-Surface Molecular Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and control of atomic-scale spin structures constitute major challenges for spin-based quantum technology platforms, including quantum dots, color centers, and molecular spins. Here, we showcase a strategy for designing the quantum properties of molecular spin qubits by combining tip-assisted on-surface assembly with electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM): We fabricate magnetic dimer complexes that consist of an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule and an organometallic half-sandwich complex formed by the FePc ligand and an attached iron atom, Fe(C6H6). The total complex forms a mixed-spin (1/2,1) quantum ferrimagnet with a well-separated correlated ground state doublet, which we utilize for coherent control. As a result of the correlation, the quantum ferrimagnet shows an improved spin lifetime (&gt;1.5 ${\mu}$s) as it is partially protected against inelastic electron scattering. Lastly, the ferrimagnet units also enable intermolecular coupling, that can be used to realize both ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic structures. Thus, quantum ferrimagnets provide a versatile platform to improve coherent control in general and to study complex magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Flat Electron Bands with Bad Valley Quantum Numbers in Twisted Bi-Layer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the energy spectrum of a nearest-neighbor electron hopping model for bi-layer graphene at commensurate twist angles. Specifically, we focus on the simplest bi-layer lattices, with moire patterns that have no subcells. The electron hopping hamiltonian is analyzed in momentum space, both by degenerate perturbation theory and by exact numerical calculation. We find that the degeneracy in energy along the edge of the moire Brillouin zone due to the two valley quantum numbers is noticeably broken in the flat central bands at the magic twist angle. A mechanism for the appearance of flat central bands themselves at the magic twist angle is also revealed. It is due to maximal level repulsion. The mechanism relies on the assumption that the phase factor for the AA hamiltonian matrix element for inter-graphene-sheet hopping at the middle of the edge of the moire Brillouin zone has a phase equal to half the twist angle. This assumption is confirmed in the case of uniform AA hopping in between the two sheets of graphene, in the limit of large moire unit cells.</description>

      <title>Resistively detected electron spin resonance and g factor in few-layer exfoliated MoS2 devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising material for enabling quantum devices and spintronic applications. In this context, the demonstration of resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) and the determination and improved physical understanding of the g factor are of great importance. However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited so far by Schotttky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~ 1.92 and observe that the g factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect and current distribution in the 3D topological insulator HgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in the three-dimensional topological insulator HgTe, which features topological Dirac-type surface states in a bulk gap opened by strain. Despite the co-existence of multiple carrier subsystems, the system exhibits perfectly quantized Hall plateaus at high magnetic fields. Here we study the system using three different experimental techniques: Transport experiments, capacitance measurements including the quantum capacitance, and current distribution measurements using electrostatically sensitive scanning probe microscopy. Our key finding is that at sufficiently high magnetic fields, the different electronic subsystems merge into one, and the current in a quantum Hall plateau is distributed across the entire width of the Hall bar device.</description>

      <title>Surface magnetic stabilization and the photo-emission chiral-induced spin-selectivity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinterface mechanism was suggested as a possible origin for the chirality induced spin-selectivity (CISS) effect, and was used to explain and reproduce, with remarkable accuracy, experimental data from transport experiments showing the CISS effect. Here, we apply the spinterface mechanism to explain the appearance of magnetization at the interface between non-magnetic metals and chiral molecules, through the stabilization of other-wise fluctuating magnetic moments. We show that the stabilization of surface magnetic moments occurs for a wide range of realistic parameters and is robust against dephasing. Importantly, we show that the direction of the surface magnetic moments is determined by the chiral axis of the chiral molecules. Armed with the concept of stable surface magnetic moments, we then formulated a theory for the photoemission CISS effect. The theory, based on spin-dependent scattering, leads to direct predictions regarding the relation between the photoemission CISS effect, the chiral axis direction, the spinterface "size", and the tilt angle of the detector with respect to the surface. These predictions are within reach of current experimental capabilities, and may shed new light on the origin of the CISS effect.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for topological surface states of three-dimensional lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a generalized transfer matrix method that provides exact analytical and numerical solutions for lattice versions of topological models with surface termination in one direction. We construct a generalized eigenvalue equation, equivalent to the conventional transfer matrix, which neither suffers from nor requires singular (non-invertible) inter-layer hopping matrices, in contrast to previous works. We then apply this formalism to derive, with exactness, the topological surface states and Fermi arc states in two prototypical topological models: the 3D Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and a lattice model exhibiting Weyl semimetal behavior. Our results show that the surface states and bulk bands, across the projected 2D Brillouin zone, agree perfectly with those obtained through direct numerical diagonalization of the corresponding Hamiltonians in a slab geometry. This highlights that the generalized transfer matrix method is not only a powerful tool but also a highly efficient alternative to fully numerical methods for investigating surface physics and interfaces in topological systems, particularly when it is required to go beyond low-energy effective descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon Chern insulators (MCIs) exhibit unique topological magnon band structures featuring chiral edge states. Direct observations of the topologically protected magnon edge states have long been pursued. Here, we report the spatially resolved detection of magnon edge states in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with honeycomb lattice (single-layer chromium triiodide). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed magnon-assisted inelastic tunneling conductance and revealed the gapped magnon spectra with enhanced signals at the van Hove singularities. Extra tunneling conductance contributed from the magnon edge states was detected at three different edge configurations. Our work provided direct evidence proving the existence of MCI states down to the single-layer limit, initiating spatially-resolved explorations on exotic properties arising from topological edge states of MCIs.</description>

Abstract: A simple model and computation of Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters is presented. Assuming continuous adsorbate coverage on top of 2D bilayer and Moir\'e potential-driven nanocluster formation at fcc sites of Moir\'e landscape, these sites experience the influx of one component of a bicomponent adsorbate and the outflux of another component. Kinetics of this process is characterized for several combinations of adsorption potentials and their relative strengths.</description>

      <title>Semiconductive and Ferromagnetic Lanthanide MXenes Derived from Carbon Intercalated Two-dimensional Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors are a key focus in developing next-generation information storage technologies. MXenes, as emerging 2D early transition metal carbides and nitrides, offer versatile compositions and tunable chemical structures. Incorporating lanthanide metals, with their unique role of 4f-electrons in engineering physical properties, into MXenes holds potential for advancing technological applications. However, the scarcity of lanthanide-containing ternary MAX phase precursors and the propensity of lanthanides to oxidize pose significant challenges to obtain lanthanide MXenes (Ln2CT2) via the top-down etching method. Here, we propose a general bottom-up methodology for lanthanide MXenes, that derive from carbon intercalated van der Waals building blocks of 2D halides. Compared to conventional MXenes conductors, the synthesized Ln2CT2 exhibit tunable band gaps spanning 0.32 eV to 1.22 eV that cover typical semiconductors such as Si (1.12 eV) and Ge (0.67 eV). Additionally, the presence of unpaired f-electrons endows Ln2CT2 with intrinsic ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures ranging between 36 K and 60 K. Theoretical calculations reveal that, in contrast to traditional MXenes, the number of d-electrons states around the Fermi level are largely diminishes in bare Ln2C MXenes, and the halogen terminals can further exhaust these electrons to open band gaps. Meanwhile, the Ln-4f electrons in Ln2CT2 are highly localized and stay away from the Fermi level, contributing to the spin splitting for the observed ferromagnetic behavior. Lanthanide MXenes hold immense promise for revolutionizing future applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of beta-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Picocavity-enhanced near-field optical microscopy with 1 nm resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for the observation of the optical response of material surfaces with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. A spatial resolution of 10-100 nm is routinely achieved in s-SNOM based on amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) with tapping amplitudes of tens of nanometers. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of structures that are localized to the atomic scale remain a significant challenge. This can be overcome by combining the field enhancement localized at the atomic-scale structure of the tip apex, namely a plasmonic picocavity, with frequency-modulationAFM (FM-AFM), namely non-contact AFM, in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Here, we developed picocavityenhanced SNOM (PE-SNOM) under visible laser illumination based on the integration of a quartz tuning fork sensor with small-amplitude oscillations of 1 nm or less. In addition, the use of a focused ion beam-polished silver tip mounted on the sensor leads to strong field enhancement in the picocavity and ensures minimal background scattering from the tip shaft. PE-SNOM allows us to obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. PE-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale targets, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.</description>

      <title>Beyond Electric-Dipole Treatment of Light-Matter Interactions in Materials: Nondipole Harmonic Generation in Bulk Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A beyond electric-dipole light-matter theory is needed to describe emerging X-ray and THz applications for characterization and control of quantum materials but inaccessible as nondipole lattice-aperiodic terms impede on the use of Bloch's theorem. To circumvent this, we derive a formalism that captures dominant nondipole effects in intense electromagnetic fields while conserving lattice translational symmetry. Our approach enables the first accurate nondipole first-principles microscopic simulation of nonperturbative harmonic generation in Si. We reveal nondipole-induced transverse currents generating perturbative even-ordered harmonics and display the onset of nondipole high harmonic generation near the laser damage threshold.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of a spin-polarized electron plasma with magnetic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a mean-field model that describes the nonlinear dynamics of a spin-polarized electron gas interacting with fixed, positively-charged ions possessing a magnetic moment that evolves in time. The mobile electrons are modeled by a four-component distribution function in the two-dimensional phase space $(x,v)$, obeying a Vlasov-Poisson set of equations. The ions are modeled by a Landau-Lifshitz equation for their spin density, which contains ion-ion and electron-ion magnetic exchange terms. We perform a linear response study of the coupled Vlasov-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz (VPLL) equations for the case of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium, focussing in particular on the spin dispersion relation. Condition of stability or instability for the spin modes are identified, which depend essentially on the electron spin polarization rate $\eta$ and the electron-ion magnetic coupling constant $K$. We also develop an Eulerian grid-based computational code for the fully nonlinear VPLL equations, based on the geometric Hamiltonian method first developed in [N. Crouseilles et al. Journal of Plasma Physics, 89(2):905890215, 2023]. This technique allows us to achieve great accuracy for the conserved quantities, such as the modulus of the ion spin vector and the total energy. Numerical tests in the linear regime are in accordance with the estimations of the linear response theory. For two-stream equilibria, we study the interplay of instabilities occurring in both the charge and the spin sectors. The set of parameters used in the simulations, with densities close to those of solids ($\approx 10^{29} \rm m^{-3}$) and temperatures of the order of 10 eV, may be relevant to the warm dense matter regime appearing in some inertial fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Optical-to-Microwave Conversion Using Si Photonic Integrated Circuit Ge Photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated circuit technology enables the scaling of circuit complexity and functionality while maintaining manufacturability and reliability. Integration is expected to play an important role in quantum information technologies, including in the highly demanding task of producing the classical signals to control and measure quantum circuits at scales needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we experimentally characterize the cryogenic performance of a miniaturized photonic integrated circuit fabricated by a commercial foundry that down-converts classical optical signals to microwave signals. The circuit consists of waveguide-integrated germanium PIN photodiodes packaged using a scalable photonic wire bonding approach to a multi-channel optical fiber array that provides the optical excitation. We find the peak optical-to-microwave conversion response to be $\sim 150 \pm 13$ mA/W in the O-band at 4.2 K, well below the temperature the circuit was designed for and tested at in the past, for two different diode designs. The second diode design operates to over 6 GHz of 3 dB bandwidth making it suitable for controlling quantum circuits, with improvements in bandwidth and response expected from improved packaging. The demonstrated miniaturization and integration offers new perspectives for wavelength-division multiplexed control of microwave quantum circuits and scalable processors using light delivered by optical fiber arrays.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>

      <title>Topological Order in the Spectral Riemann Surfaces of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Lead-free Hybrid Perovskite: An Efficient Room Temperature Spin Generator via Large Interfacial Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) demonstates great potential for developing flexible and wearable spintronic devices, by serving as spin sources via the bulk Rashba effect (BRE). However, the practical application of BRE in 2D HOIP faces huge challenges, particularly due to the toxicity of lead, which is crucial for achieving large spin-orbit coupling, and the restrictions in 2D HOIP candidates to meet specific symmetry-breaking requirements. To overcome these obstacles, we design a strategy to exploit the interfacial Rashba effect (IRE) of lead-free 2D HOIP (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2CuCl4 (PEA-CuCl), manifesting as an efficient spin generator at room temperature. IRE of PEA-CuCl originates from the large orbital hybridization at the interface between PEA-CuCl and adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements further quantify a large Rashba effective field of 14.04 Oe per 10^11 A m-2, surpassing those of lead-based HOIP and traditional all-inorganic heterojunctions with noble metals. Our lead-free 2D HOIP PEA-CuCl, which harnesses large IRE for spin generation, is efficient, nontoxic, and economic, offering huge promise for future flexible and wearable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Temporally correlated quantum noise in driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous effects of the environment on quantum-mechanical systems generally cause temporally correlated fluctuations. This particularly holds for systems of interest for quantum computation where such effects lead to correlated errors. The Markovian approximation neglects these correlations and thus fails to accurately describe open-system dynamics where these correlations become relevant. In driven open systems, yet another approximation is persistently used, often unknowingly, in which one describes the decay effects independently from the time-dependent controlling fields acting on the system, thereby ignoring further temporally correlated effects. To overcome these shortcomings, we develop a quantum master equation for driven systems weakly coupled to quantum environments that avoids the aforementioned field-independent approximation, as well as the Markovian approximation. Our method makes it possible to track all occurring decay channels and their time-dependent generalized rates which we illustrate in the example of a generally driven two-level system. We also demonstrate that correlated and field-dependent dissipative effects can lead to an increase in the performance of single-qubit gate operations.</description>

Abstract: As two-dimensional (2D) materials continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive scanning tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls and grain boundaries, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components become inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can underpin the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising way for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking a cavity needs to discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality that can only be achieved with metamaterials. Here, we suggest and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for a selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific chirality. Our metasurface cavity maintains maximum chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby turning the angle of incidence from a constraint to a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer precise control of resonance wavelengths. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and show the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards novel quantum material engineering with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as superconductivity and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl semimetals with dislocations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals (WSMs) represent three-dimensional gapless topological states of matter characterized by the monopole-antimonopole pairs of the Abelian Berry curvature at the band-touching points in the momentum space. As a consequence, they display chiral anomalies that can be realized through a crystalline dislocation defect associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. Using the last two features of WSMs as our guiding principles, we construct a holographic WSM with dislocations by utilizing the ($4+1$)-dimensional Chern-Simons gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This theory encodes the chiral anomaly and incorporates torsion, thereby holographically capturing lattice dislocation defects. By explicitly solving the equations of motion employing the asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that such a theory at the ($3+1$)-dimensional spacetime boundary possesses axially-symmetric solutions that can be interpreted as holographic WSMs with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded through a black hole in the bulk gravity. Such solutions, at the same time, feature the chiral anomaly proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results should therefore motivate future studies of the holographic topological phases by employing bulk gravitational Chern-Simons theories and establishing torsion as a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Topological frequency conversion in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases in a double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Roman Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that it is the backbone channels through which transport happens, not through the nitrogen bases. These new experimental studies call for a detail investigation of these biomolecules from a different perspective. In this article we examine charge transport properties of a double-stranded DNA within a tight-binding framework where the backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green's function method, we inspect changes in the density of states (DOS) and localization properties of DNA in presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of backbone channel discontinuities on current-voltage (I-V) responses using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. We study three characteristic DNA sequences, two periodic and one random. We observe that, in all cases, the effects of nicks on the transport properties are similar. Irrespective of the I-V responses of pristine sequences (be it metallic or semiconducting), as soon as we introduce two nicks at two different strands, current is cut-off. Hence we claim that the backbone channel supported charge conduction in DNA is an universal phenomena irrespective of the sequence and its pristine I-V characteristics.</description>

      <title>Industrially fabricated single-electron quantum dots in Si/Si-Ge heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-B\"uttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Domain-Wall Confinement in Raman Spectroscopy of Ising Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesonic bound states of domain walls can be stabilized in quasi one-dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, we theoretically study the Raman light scattering response of a twisted Kitaev chain with tilted magnetic fields as a minimal model for confinement in $\mathrm{CoNb}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$. By both numerical matrix product states and few-domain wall variational states, we show that confinement-induced bound states directly manifest themselves as sharp peaks in the Raman response. Remarkably, by tuning the polarization of the incident light field, we demonstrate that the Raman response offers new insights into the intrinsic symmetry of the bound state wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetals induced by quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl-Kondo semimetals are strongly correlated topological semimetals that develop through the cooperation of the Kondo effect with space group symmetries. The Kondo effect, capturing quantum fluctuations associated with strong correlations, is usually suppressed by magnetic order. Here we develop the theory of magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetal. The key of the proposed mechanism is that the magnetic order comes from conduction $d$ electrons, such that the local $f$ moments can still fluctuate. We illustrate the extreme case where the magnetic space group symmetries prevent any spontaneous magnetization on the sites with the $f$-orbitals. In this case, topological degeneracies, including hourglass Weyl-Kondo nodal lines, appear when the magnetic space group symmetry constrains the Kondo-driven low-energy excitations; they lead to a third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall response. Based on the proposed mechanism, we explore the interplay between strong correlations and symmetries with database search leading to several candidate materials. The most prominent candidates are antiferromagnetic $\rm UNiGa$ and $\rm UNiAl$, with a third-order anomalous Hall response, as well as ferromagnetic $\rm USbTe$ and $\rm CeCoPO$, with a first-order one. Our findings pave the way for future experimental and theoretical investigations that promise to further advance the overarching theme of strongly correlated topology.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing due to multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work, we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential, in agreement with previous studies. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. We also show that the divergent odd-frequency pairing is robust against scalar disorder. Notably, we establish a spectral bulk-boundary correspondence between the amount of boundary odd-$\omega$ pairing and the bulk topological invariants in driven chiral systems, which we show to be protected by chiral symmetry and is thus robust against disorder. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Nanotubes from Chemical Cleavage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>
