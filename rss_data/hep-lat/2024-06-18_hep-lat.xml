      <title>A modified Cayley transform for SU(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU(3)}$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>Isospin QCD as a laboratory for dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD with the isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, is a useful laboratory to delineate the microphysics in dense QCD. To study the quark-hadron-continuity we use a quark-meson model that interpolates hadronic and quark matter physics at microscopic level. The equation of state is dominated by mesons at low density but taken over by quarks at high density. We extend our previous studies with two-flavors to the three-flavors case to study the impact of the strangeness which may be brought by kaons $(K_+, K_0) = (u\bar{s}, s\bar{d})$ and the U$_A$(1) anomaly. In the normal phase the excitation energies of kaons are reduced by $\mu_I$ in the same way as hyperons in nuclear matter at finite baryon chemical potential. Once pions condense, kaon excitation energies increases as $\mu_I$ does. Moreover, strange quarks become more massive through the U$_A$(1) coupling to the condensed pions. Hence at zero and low temperature the strange hadrons and quarks are highly suppressed. The previous findings in two-flavor models, sound speed peak, negative trace anomaly, gaps insensitve to $\mu_I$, persist in our three-flavor model and remain consistent with the lattice results to $\mu_I \sim 1$ GeV. We discuss the non-perturbative power corrections and quark saturation effects as important ingredients to understand the crossover equations of state measured on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Regularization effects in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model: Strong scheme dependence of inhomogeneous phases and persistence of the moat regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the phase structure of the non-renormalizable (3+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with particular focus on inhomogeneous phases (IPs), where the chiral condensate is non-uniform in space, and the closely related moat regimes, where mesonic dispersion relations favor non-vanishing momenta. We use the mean-field approximation and consider five different regularization schemes including three lattice discretizations. The results within the different regularization schemes are systematically analyzed in order to study the dependence of the IP on the choice of regulatization scheme and regulator value. The IP exhibits a drastic dependence on the chosen regularization scheme rendering any physical interpretation of results on inhomogeneous phases in this model doubtful. In contrast, we find only a mild scheme dependence of the moat regime suggesting that its existence is a consequence of the action of the NJL model and its symmetries and, thus, that it might also exist in QCD.</description>

      <title>Lattice $B$-field correlators for heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the color-magnetic (or "$B$") field two-point function that encodes the finite-mass correction to the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient. The simulations are done on fine isotropic lattices in the quenched approximation at $1.5\,T_c$, using a range of gradient flow times for noise suppression and operator renormalization. The continuum extrapolation is performed at fixed flow time followed by a second extrapolation to zero flow time. Perturbative calculations to next-to-leading order of this correlation function, matching gradient-flowed correlators to MS-bar, are used to resolve nontrivial renormalization issues. We perform a spectral reconstruction based on perturbative model fits to estimate the coefficient $\kappa_B$ of the finite-mass correction to the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient. The approach we present here yields high-precision data for the correlator with all renormalization issues incorporated at next-to-leading order, and is also applicable for actions with dynamical fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin ice in three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the isospin eigenstate $\bar D \Sigma_c$, $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$, and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks by their electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the $\mathrm{P_{c}(4312)}$, $\mathrm{P_{c}(4380)}$, and $\mathrm{P_{c}(4440)}$ pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}$, $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, and $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2 $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the light element abundances in the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$. We compare the methods of our calculation to previous literature including the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The PDG result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $-0.014 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.026$, for deuterium we find the constraint $-0.005 \leq \delta v / v \leq -0.001$. These bounds are more stringent than what was found earlier.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>
