      <title>JWST/NIRSpec WIDE survey: a z=4.6 low-mass star-forming galaxy hosting a jet-driven shock with low ionisation and solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z=4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* = 1.4$\times$10^{10} M$_\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\beta$ luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.</description>

      <title>Cold fronts in galaxy clusters I: A case for the large-scale global eigen modes in unmagnetized and weakly magnetized cluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters show large-scale azimuthal X-ray surface brightness fluctuations known as cold fronts. These are overdense (average density jumps $\sim 30\%$ or post-jump density $\sim 130\%$) and have milder discontinuity in pressure. Cold fronts are argued to originate due to sloshing driven by sub-halo passage at close proximity to the cluster center. While this is a viable source of large-scale perturbations, the physical mechanisms that can sustain such density structures (of specific geometry) are not clear. In this work, we explore whether long wavelength thermal instability is an explanation for cold front formation in a cluster core which is perturbed by sub-halos or AGN activity. Using global linear perturbation analysis, we show that internal gravity waves (thermally unstable) can form large-scale three-dimensional spiral structures, akin to observed cold fronts. We explore if the presence of magnetic field (along spherical $\hat{\phi}$) may support such structures (by suppressing small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz modes) or disrupt them (by promoting additional thermal instability). We find that latter happens at shorter wavelengths and only at frequencies above the characteristic buoyancy or Brunt V\"ais\"al\"a frequency ($&gt;N_{\rm BV}$). Our work implies, firstly, that large-scale spirals may be formed and sustained over a long timescale ($&gt;N^{-1}_{\rm BV}$) even in presence of aligned magnetic fields that is otherwise supportive against mixing at the interface. Secondly, short-wavelength (but relatively longer along the field) unstable compressive modes may form within or in the vicinity of such spirals. The instability is an overstable slow wave, and grows in 2D at timescales $\gtrsim 2-3$ times longer than the spiral growth timescale (via thermal instability). Thus we claim that this instability cannot destroy the large scale coherence.</description>

      <title>The atomic gas sequence and mass-metallicity relation from dwarfs to massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy scaling relations provide insights into the processes that drive galaxy evolution. The extension of these scaling relations into the dwarf galaxy regime is of particular interest. This is because dwarf galaxies represent a crucial stage in galaxy evolution, and understanding them could also shed light on their role in reionising the early Universe. There is currently no consensus on the processes that dominate the evolution of dwarfs. In this work we constrain the atomic gas sequence (stellar mass vs. atomic gas fraction) and mass-metallicity relation (stellar mass vs. gas phase metallicity) from dwarf ($10^{6.5}$ $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$) to massive ($10^{11.5}$ $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$) galaxies in the local Universe. The combined optical and 21-cm spectroscopic observations of the DESI and ALFALFA surveys allow us to simultaneously constrain both scaling relations. We find a slope change of the atomic gas sequence at a stellar mass of $\sim 10^{9} ~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$. We also find that the shape and scatter of the atomic gas sequence and mass-metallicity relation are strongly linked for both dwarfs and more massive galaxies. Consequently, the low mass slope change of the atomic gas sequence is imprinted onto the mass-metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies. The mass scale of the measured slope change is consistent with a predicted escape velocity threshold below which low mass galaxies experience significant supernova-driven gas loss, as well as with a reduction in cold gas accretion onto more massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) via SH radicals in interstellar CO-rich ice under dense cloud conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is widely observed in the gas phase towards star-forming regions and was the first of the only two sulfur-bearing species detected in interstellar ices so far. However, the chemical network governing its formation is still not fully understood. While the sulfurization of CO and the oxidation of CS are often invoked to form OCS, other mechanisms could have a significant contribution. In particular, the multistep reaction involving CO and SH is a good candidate to forming OCS in dense cloud environments. We aim to constrain the viability of the CO + SH route to forming solid OCS in the interstellar medium, in a similar manner as CO + OH is known to produce CO2 ice. This is achieved by conducting a systematic laboratory investigation of the targeted reactions on interstellar ice analogues under dense cloud conditions. An ultrahigh vacuum chamber is utilized to simultaneously deposit CO, H2S, and atomic H at 10 K. SH radicals produced in situ via hydrogen abstraction from H2S react with CO to form OCS. OCS is efficiently formed through surface reactions involving CO, H2S, and H atoms. The suggested underlying mechanism behind OCS formation is CO + SH -&gt; HSCO followed by HSCO + H -&gt; OCS + H2. The OCS yield reduces slowly, but remains significant with increasing CO:H2S mixing ratios (CO:H2S = 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1). Our experiments provide unambiguous evidence that OCS can be formed from CO + SH in the presence of H atoms. This route remains efficient for large H2S dilutions (5% w.r.t CO), suggesting that it is a viable mechanism in interstellar ices. Given that SH radicals can be created in clouds throughout a wide evolutionary timescale, this mechanism could have a non-negligible contribution to forming interstellar OCS ice.</description>

      <title>Characterizing chemical abundance ratios in extremely metal-poor star-forming galaxies in DESI EDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for galaxies in the local Universe with extremely low oxygen abundance, that is, more than 25 times lower than solar, which corresponds to 12 + log(O/H) &lt; 7.3. To determine the oxygen abundance, we apply the direct Te method for objects where the [OIII]4363 line is detected. We identified 21 extremely metal-poor galaxies in the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI EDR), for some of which we also derived N/O, Ne/O, Ar/O, and S/O ratios. We find that many DESI galaxies with extremely low oxygen abundance exhibit a higher N/O ratio in comparison to the reference low-metallicity sample collected from the literature. We suggest that the elevation in N/O ratio may be explained by a contamination with metal-rich gas caused by gas inflow or a merger event. Moreover, contrary to some recent studies, we find that Ar/O and S/O ratios are enhanced as well, while the Ne/O ratio does not show such elevation. One of the galaxies, J0713+5608, has a remarkably low oxygen abundance of 6.978$\pm$0.095 dex. This measurement aligns with the lowest known oxygen abundances in galaxies to date. Given the relatively high uncertainty, this galaxy may have the lowest oxygen abundance ever found. Additionally, J0713+5608 exhibited an enhanced N/O ratio compared to the typical N/O ratio observed in metal-poor galaxies within the local Universe.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Massive Star Clusters in the Central Starburst of M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a near infrared (NIR) candidate star cluster catalog for the central kiloparsec of M82 based on new JWST NIRCam images. We identify star cluster candidates using the F250M filter, finding 1357 star cluster candidates with stellar masses $&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$. Compared to previous optical catalogs, nearly all (87%) of the candidates we identify are new. The star cluster candidates have a median intrinsic cluster radius of $\approx$1 pc and have stellar masses up to $10^6$ M$_\odot$. By comparing the color-color diagram to dust-free yggdrasil stellar population models, we estimate that the star cluster candidates have A$_{\rm V}\sim3-24$ mag, corresponding to A$_{\rm 2.5\mu m}\sim0.3-2.1$ mag. There is still appreciable dust extinction towards these clusters into the NIR. We measure the stellar masses of the star cluster candidates, assuming ages of 0 and 8 Myr. The slope of the resulting cluster mass function is $\beta=1.9\pm0.2$, in excellent agreement with studies of star clusters in other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Structure functions with higher-order stencils as a probe to separate small- and large-scale magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are an energetically important component of star-formation galaxies, but it is often difficult to measure their properties from observations. One of the complexities stems from the fact that the magnetic fields, especially in spiral galaxies, have a two-scale nature: a large-scale field, coherent over ${\rm kpc}$ scales and a small-scale, random field with a scale of $\lesssim$ $100~{\rm pc}$. Moreover, it is known that the strength of small- and large-scale fields are comparable and this makes it even harder to find their imprints in radio polarisation observations such as the Faraday rotation measure, ${\rm RM}$, which is the integral over the path length of the product of the thermal electron density and the parallel component of the magnetic field to the line of sight. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of second-order structure functions of ${\rm RM}$ computed with multiple higher-order stencils as a powerful analysis to separate the small- and large-scale magnetic field components. In particular, we provide new methods and calibrations to compute the scale and the strength of the large-scale magnetic field in the presence of small-scale magnetic fluctuations. We then apply the method to find the scale of large-scale magnetic fields in the nearby galaxies M51 and NGC 6946, using archival data and further discuss the need for computing the ${\rm RM}$ structure functions with higher-order stencils. With multiple modern radio polarisation observatories and eventually the Square Kilometre Array, ${\rm RM}$ observations will significantly improve in quantity and quality, and the higher-order stencil structure function techniques developed here can be used to extract information about multiscale magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the origin of cold gas and star formation in a rare population of strongly bulge-dominated early-type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of a rare population, the strongly bulge-dominated early-type galaxies (referred to as sBDEs) with significant HI gas, using the databases from the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We select the sBDEs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and cross-match with the FASHI-ALFALFA combined HI sample, resulting in 104 HI-rich sBDEs. These sBDEs tend to have extremely high HI reservoirs, which is rare in previous studies such as ATLAS$^{3D}$. 70% of the selected sBDEs are classified as quiescent galaxies, even though they have a large HI reservoir. We study the properties of these sBDEs from five main aspects: stellar population, gas-phase metallicity, stacked HI spectra, environment, and spatially resolved MaNGA data. The majority of HI-rich sBDEs appear to show lower gas-phase metallicity and are located in significantly lower-density environments, suggesting an external origin for their HI gas. We find that star-forming sBDEs exhibit statistically higher star formation efficiency and slightly older stellar populations compared to normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting a recent star formation on Gyr-timescale. They also show narrower and more concentrated HI profiles compared to control star-forming galaxies, which may explain their higher star formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Transition from Galaxy-wide Gas Inflow to Outflow in Quasar Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic-wide outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a routinely invoked feedback mechanism in galaxy evolution models. Hitherto, the interplay among the interstellar gas on galactic scales, the propagation of AGN outflows and the fundamental AGN parameters during evolution remains elusive. Powerful nuclear outflows are found to favorably exist at early AGN stages usually associated with high accretion rates and weak narrow emission lines. In a sample of quasars emitting Mg II narrow absorption lines (NALs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we discover an unprecedented phenomenon where galaxy-scale inflow-dominated transforming into outflow-dominated gas accompanied by an increasing strength of the narrow [O III] line, at a confidence level of 6.7{\sigma}. The fact that nuclear outflows diminish while galaxy-wide outflows intensifies as AGNs evolve implies that early-stage outflows interact with interstellar medium on galactic scales and trigger the gradual transformation into galaxy-wide outflows, providing observational links to the hypothetical multi-stage propagation of AGN outflows that globally regulates galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.</description>

      <title>Probing the morphology of polarized emission induced by fluctuation dynamo using Minkowski functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drives turbulence and maintains magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales ($\ell_{\rm f}$) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures, and their connection to fractional polarization ($p_{\rm f}$). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies give rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to $\ell_{\rm f}$. Above $\sim3\,{\rm GHz}$, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area ($N_{\rm CC, peak}$) is related to the mean $p_{\rm f}$ ($\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle$) of the emitting region as $\langle p_{\rm f} \rangle \propto N_{\rm CC, peak}^{-1/4}$, provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than $\ell_{\rm f}$. This implies that $N_{\rm CC,peak}$ represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer $\ell_{\rm f}$ via the relation $\ell_{\rm f} \propto N_{\rm CC,peak}^{-1/2}$. An estimate on $\ell_{\rm f}$ thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Timeline of the M81 Group: Properties of the Extended Structures of M82 and NGC 3077</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of and interactions between galaxies imprint a wide diversity of morphological, dynamical, and chemical characteristics in stellar halos and tidal streams. Measuring these characteristics elucidates aspects of the progenitors of the galaxies we observe today. The M81 group is the perfect galaxy group to understand the past, present, and future of a group of galaxies in the process of merging. Here we measure the end of star formation (t$_{90}$) and metallicity ([M/H]) of the stellar halo of M82 and the eastern tidal stream of NGC 3077 to: 1) test the idea that M82 possesses a genuine stellar halo, formed before any interaction with M81, 2) determine if NGC 3077's tidal disruption is related to the star formation history in its tails, and 3) create a timeline of the assembly history of the central trio in the M81 group. We argue that M82 possesses a genuine, metal poor ([M/H] ~ -1.62 dex) stellar halo, formed from the merger of a small satellite galaxy roughly 6.6 Gyr ago. We also find that the stars present in NGC 3077's tails formed before tidal disruption with M81, and possesses a roughly uniform metallicity as shown in Okamoto et. al. 2023 implying that NGC 3077's progenitor had significant population gradients. Finally, we present a timeline of the central trio's merger/interaction history.</description>

      <title>Signatures of mass segregation from competitive accretion and monolithic collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two main competing theories proposed to explain the formation of massive ($&gt;10$M$_\odot$) stars -- competitive accretion and monolithic core collapse -- make different observable predictions for the environment of the massive stars during, and immediately after, their formation. Proponents of competitive accretion have long predicted that the most massive stars should have a different spatial distribution to lower-mass stars, either through the stars being mass segregated, or being in areas of higher relative densities, or sitting deeper in gravitational potential wells. We test these predictions by analysing a suite of SPH simulations where star clusters form massive stars via competitive accretion with and without feedback. We find that the most massive stars have higher relative densities, and sit in deeper potential wells, only in simulations in which feedback is not present. When feedback is included, only half of the simulations have the massive stars residing in deeper potential wells, and there are no other distinguishing signals in their spatial distributions. Intriguingly, in our simple models for monolithic core collapse, the massive stars may also end up in deeper potential wells, because if massive cores fragment the stars are still massive, and dominate their local environs. We find no robust diagnostic test in the spatial distributions of massive stars that can distinguish their formation mechanisms, and so other predictions for distinguishing between competitive accretion and monolithic collapse are required.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing electromagnetic transport models.</description>

      <title>Variable, circularly polarized radio emission from the Young Stellar Object [BHB2007]-1: another ingredient of a unique system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The young stellar object [BHB2007]-1 has been extensively studied in the past at radio, millimeter, and infrared wavelengths. It shows a gap in the disk and previous observations claimed the possible emission from a forming sub-stellar object, in correspondence to the disk gap. Here, we analyze a set of 8 Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 15 GHz and spread over a month. We infer a slowly variable emission from the star, with a $\sim 15 \text{-} 20\%$ circular polarization detected in two of the eight observations. The latter can be related to the magnetic fields in the system, while the unpolarized and moderately varying component can be indicative of free-free emission associated with jet induced shocks or interaction of the stellar wind with dense surrounding material. We discard any relevant short flaring activities when sampling the radio light curves down to 10 seconds and find no clear evidence of emission from the sub-stellar object inferred from past observations, although deeper observations could shed further light on this.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of head-on low-velocity collisions between particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle contact model is important for powder simulations. Although several contact models have been proposed, their validity has not yet been well established. Therefore, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to clarify the particle interaction. We simulate head-on collisions of two particles with impact velocities less than a few percent of the sound velocity to investigate the dependence of the interparticle force and the coefficient of restitution (COR) on the impact velocity and particle radius. In this study, we treat particles with a radius of 10-100 nm and perform simulations. We find that the interparticle force exhibits hysteresis between the loading and unloading phases. Larger impact velocities result in strong hysteresis and plastic deformation. For all impact velocities and particle radii, the coefficient of restitution is smaller than that given by the Johnson-Kendall-Robert theory. An inelastic contact model cannot reproduce our MD simulations. In particular, the COR is significantly reduced when the impact velocity exceeds a certain value. This significant energy dissipation cannot be explained even by the contact models including plastic deformation. We also find that the COR increases with increasing particle radius. We also find that the previous contact models including plastic deformation cannot explain the strong energy dissipation obtained in our MD simulations, although they agree with the MD results for very low impact velocities. Accordingly, we have constructed a new dissipative contact model in which the dissipative force increases with the stress generated by collisions. The new stress dependent model successfully reproduces our MD results over a wider range of impact velocities than the conventional models do. In addition, we proposed another, simpler, dissipative contact model that can also reproduce the MD results.</description>

      <title>Bright Star Subtraction Pipeline for LSST: Phase one report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the phase one report of the Bright Star Subtraction (BSS) pipeline for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This pipeline is designed to create an extended PSF model by utilizing observed stars, followed by subtracting this model from the bright stars present in LSST data. Running the pipeline on Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data shows a correlation between the shape of the extended PSF model and the position of the detector within the camera's focal plane. Specifically, detectors positioned closer to the focal plane's edge exhibit reduced circular symmetry in the extended PSF model. To mitigate this effect, we present an algorithm that enables users to account for the location dependency of the model. Our analysis also indicates that the choice of normalization annulus is crucial for modeling the extended PSF. Smaller annuli can exclude stars due to overlap with saturated regions, while larger annuli may compromise data quality because of lower signal-to-noise ratios. This makes finding the optimal annulus size a challenging but essential task for the BSS pipeline. Applying the BSS pipeline to HSC exposures allows for the subtraction of, on average, 100 to 700 stars brighter than 12th magnitude measured in g-band across a full exposure, with a full HSC exposure comprising ~100 detectors.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Black hole mass and optical radiation mechanism of the tidal disruption event AT 2023clx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optical light curves of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2023clx in the declining phase, observed with Mephisto. Combining our light curve with the ASAS-SN and ATLAS data in the rising phase, and fitting the composite multi-band light curves with MOSFiT, we estimate black hole mass of AT 2023clx is between $10^{5.67}$--$10^{5.82}~M_{\odot}$. This event may be caused by either a full disruption of a $0.1~M_{\odot}$ star, or a partial disruption of a $0.99~M_{\odot}$ star, depending on the data adopted for the rising phase. Based on those fit results and the non-detection of soft X-ray photons in the first 90 days, we propose that the observed optical radiation is powered by stream-stream collision. We speculate that the soft X-ray photons may gradually emerge in 100--600 days after the optical peak, when the debris is fully circularized into a compact accretion disk.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to exist, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of a regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>

      <title>On the existence of a very metal-poor disc in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a discussion for many years on whether the disc in the Milky Way extends down to low metallicity. We aim to address the question by employing a large sample of giant stars with radial velocities and homogeneous metallicities based on the Gaia DR3 XP spectra. We study the 3D velocity distribution of stars in various metallicity ranges, including the very-metal poor regime (VMP, [M/H] $&lt;-2.0$). We find that a clear disc population starts to emerge only around [M/H] $\sim -1.3$, and is not visible for [M/H] $&lt;-1.6$. Using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM), we show that there are two halo populations in the VMP regime: one stationary and one with a net prograde rotation of $\sim80\,\mathrm{km/s}$. In this low-metallicity range, we are able to place constraints on the contribution of a rotation-supported disc sub-population to a maximum of $\sim 3$\%. We compare our results to previous claims of discy VMP stars in both observations and simulations and find that having a prograde halo component could explain most of these.</description>

      <title>Updated kinematics of the Radcliffe Wave: non-synchronous, dipole-like vertical oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinematic information of the Radcliffe Wave (RW) is essential for determining its existence and gaining insights into its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity ($V_Z$) of RW by incorporating the radial velocity (RV) measures through two methods, which is crucial but was neglected previously. First, the velocities are measured towards young stars, using their RV measurements from APOGEE-2 and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in $V_Z$ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate $Z$, which differs from the conclusions of previous studies. Instead, we find a 5 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$$\cdot$kpc$^{-1}$ gradient in $V_Z$ along the RW, exhibiting a dipole-like pattern. Consequently, the kinematic arrangement does not show a corresponding coherence with the spatial arrangement, bringing the Radcliffe Wave model into question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they (i) are consistent with the MW's measured halo mass and concentration, (ii) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like ($\approx 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) subhalo within the last $2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ on a realistic orbit, placing them near $50~\mathrm{kpc}$ from the host center at $z\approx 0$, and (iii) undergo a $&gt;$1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times ($0.67&lt;z&lt;3$). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute $&lt; 1\%$ of all halos in the MW's mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain $22\%$ more subhalos with present-day virial masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches $\approx 80\%$ in the inner $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with $\approx 60\%$ of the total subhalo population within $100~\mathrm{kpc}$ found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy's dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>

      <title>Red Type-1 Quasars after Cosmic Noon and Impact on $L_{\rm UV}$-related Quasar Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, nearly a million quasars have been explored to shed light on the evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of type-1 quasars particularly offer insights into their black hole activities. Recent findings, however, raise questions about the prevalence of red type-1 quasars of which colors might be due to dust-obscuration and their potential influence on luminosity-related properties of quasars. We examine the fraction of red type-1 quasars within the redshift range of $0.68\leq z &lt; 2.20$, applying spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using optical-to-MIR photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 quasars. Approximately 10\,\% of the type-1 quasars exhibit red colors suggestive of dust obscuration. There is an association between the brightness of the MIR luminosity and a higher fraction of red type-1 quasars, albeit with negligible redshift evolution. By employing $E(B-V)$ values from the SED fitting, we obtained dereddened luminosity of the red type-1 quasars and reassess the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) estimates. Result shows a modest increase in the number density of bright quasars, linking to more flatten bright-end slope of QLFs, while $M_{\rm BH}$ adjustments are minimal. Current SDSS selections in optical could miss a significant population of heavily dust-obscured quasars. As future MIR surveys like SPHEREx expand, they may reveal enough obscured quasars to prompt a more profound revision of fundamental quasar properties.</description>

      <title>A public grid of radiative transfer simulations for Lyman-alpha and metal lines in idealised galactic outflows</title>

Abstract: The vast majority of star-forming galaxies are surrounded by large reservoirs of gas ejected from the interstellar medium. Ultraviolet absorption and emission lines represent powerful diagnostics to constrain the cool phase of these outflows, through resonant transitions of hydrogen and metal ions. The interpretation of these observations is often remarkably difficult as it requires detailed modelling of the propagation of the continuum and emission lines in the gas. To this aim, we present a large public grid of about 20000 simulated spectra which includes HI Lyman-alpha (Lya) and five metal transitions associated with MgII, CII, SiII, and FeII that is accessible online at https://rascas.univ-lyon1.fr/app/idealised_models_grid/. The spectra have been computed with the RASCAS radiative transfer code for 5760 idealised spherical configurations surrounding a central point source emission, and characterised by their column density, Doppler parameter, dust opacity, wind velocity, as well as various density/velocity gradients. Designed to interpret Lya and metal line profiles, our grid exhibits a wide diversity of resonant absorption and emission features, as well as fluorescent lines. We illustrate how it can help better constrain wind properties by performing a joint modelling of observed Lya, CII, and SiII spectra. Using CLOUDY simulations and virial scaling relations, we show that Lya is expected to be a faithful tracer of the gas at T=10^4-10^5 K, even if the medium is highly-ionised. While CII is found to probe the same range of temperatures as Lya, other metal lines merely trace cooler phases (T=10^4 K). As their gas opacity strongly depends on gas temperature, incident radiation field, metallicity and dust depletion, we caution that optically thin metal lines do not necessarily originate from low HI column densities and may not accurately probe Lyman continuum leakage.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison between velocity dependent SIDM cross sections constrained by the gravothermal and isothermal models</title>

Abstract: One necessary step for probing the nature of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) particles with astrophysical observations is to pin down any possible velocity dependence in the SIDM cross section. Major challenges for achieving this goal include eliminating, or mitigating, the impact of the baryonic components and tidal effects within the dark matter halos of interest -- the effects of these processes can be highly degenerate with those of dark matter self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with baryonic components small enough such that the baryonic gravitational potentials do not significantly influence the halo gravothermal evolution processes. We then constrain the parameters of Rutherford and Moller scattering cross section models with the measured rotation curves and stellar kinematics through the gravothermal fluid formalism and isothermal method. Cross sections constrained by the two methods are consistent at $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the isothermal method prefers cross sections greater than the gravothermal approach constraints by a factor of $\sim3$.</description>

      <title>Imprints of massive black-hole binaries on neighbouring decihertz gravitational-wave sources</title>

Abstract: The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric {GW} detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band $\lesssim10^{-5}\,\rm Hz$ in order to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy. We determine that proposed deci-Hz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^{-1}$ - $10^4)$ SMBHBs with masses $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^7$ - $10^8)\,\rm M_\odot$ out to redshift $z\sim3.5$. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.</description>

Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host-galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar mass weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the \textsc{UniverseMachine} simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host-galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host-galaxy distribution at redshift $z=0.21$ has a median star formation rate $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and a median stellar mass of $\sim 1.9 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large scale bias associated with the host-galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B- and ${ \rm K_s}$-bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark siren method.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, for a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth. The $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>

Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, masses, stellar accretion rates and gaseous outer radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. We estimate $20{-}70$ percent of discs may be mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. Our calculations indicate that BHL accretion can also supply sufficient energy to drive turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport and particularly accretion onto the star may still be driven by internal processes. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models. Our results represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by large-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. This possibility urgently motivates deep observational surveys to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 10 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 8 hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>
