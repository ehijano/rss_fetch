      <title>How to check in continually over 4,000 days on an online learning platform? An empirical experience and a practical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The check-in service is often provided as an incentive system by online learning platforms to help users establish a learning routine and achieve accomplishment. However, according to the questionnaire conducted in this study, 82.5% of users of online English learning platforms that feature a check-in service have failed to maintain the daily check-in behavior for long-term language learning, mainly by reason of demotivation, forgetfulness, boredom, and insufficient time. As a language learner, I have an empirical experience in maintaining a record of over 4,000 daily check-ins on China's leading online English learning platform of Shanbay. In the meantime, I have been constantly exploring a practical solution to help cultivate perseverance for other users to follow through the learning routine. In this paper, I systematically introduce this practical solution, the GILT method, and its instructions. The experience and solution for perseverance development are based on Shanbay, but they can be applied to other learning platforms for different purposes.</description>

      <title>Bizarre Love Triangle: Generative AI, Art, and Kitsch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has engrossed the mainstream culture, expanded AI's creative user base, and catalyzed economic, legal, and aesthetic issues that stir a lively public debate. Unsurprisingly, GenAI tools proliferate kitsch in the hands of amateurs and hobbyists, but various shortcomings also induce kitsch into a more ambitious, professional artists' production with GenAI. I explore them in this paper. Following the introductory outline of digital kitsch and AI art, I review GenAI artworks that manifest five interrelated types of kitsch-engendering expressive flaws: the superficial foregrounding or faulty circumvention of generative models' formal signatures, the feeble critique of AI, the mimetics, and the unacknowledged poetic similarities, all marked by an overreliance on AI as a cultural signifier. I discuss the normalization of these blunders through GenAI art's good standing within the art world and keen relationship with the AI industry, which contributes to the adulteration of AI discourse and the possible corruption of artistic literacy. In conclusion, I emphasize that recognizing different facets of artists' uncritical embrace of techno-cultural trends, comprehending their functions, and anticipating their unintended effects is crucial for reaching relevance and responsibility in AI art.</description>

      <title>The Manifold of the Absolute: Religious Perennialism as Generative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formalizes religious epistemology through the mathematics of Variational Autoencoders. We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide.</description>

      <title>When Visibility Outpaces Verification: Delayed Verification and Narrative Lock-in in Agentic AI Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems-autonomous entities capable of independent planning and execution-reshape the landscape of human-AI trust. Long before direct system exposure, user expectations are mediated through high-stakes public discourse on social platforms. However, platform-mediated engagement signals (e.g., upvotes) may inadvertently function as a ``credibility proxy,'' potentially stifling critical evaluation.
  This paper investigates the interplay between social proof and verification timing in online discussions of agentic AI. Analyzing a longitudinal dataset from two distinct Reddit communities with contrasting interaction cultures-r/OpenClaw and r/Moltbook-we operationalize verification cues via reproducible lexical rules and model the ``time-to-first-verification'' using a right-censored survival analysis framework.
  Our findings reveal a systemic ``Popularity Paradox'': high-visibility discussions in both subreddits experience significantly delayed or entirely absent verification cues compared to low-visibility threads. This temporal lag creates a critical window for ``Narrative Lock-in,'' where early, unverified claims crystallize into collective cognitive biases before evidence-seeking behaviors emerge. We discuss the implications of this ``credibility-by-visibility'' effect for AI safety and propose ``epistemic friction'' as a design intervention to rebalance engagement-driven platforms.</description>

      <title>Digital Ecosystems: Enabling Collaboration in a Fragmented World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As geopolitical, organizational, and technological fragmentation deepens, resilient digital collaboration becomes imperative. This paper develops a spectrum framework of polycentric digital ecosystems-nested socio-technical systems spanning personal, organizational, inter-organizational, and global layers. Integration across these layers is enabled by four technology clusters: AI and automation, blockchain trust, federated data spaces, and immersive technologies. By redefining digital ecosystems as distributed, adaptive networks of loosely coupled actors, this study outlines new pathways for crossborder coordination and innovation. The framework extends platform theory by introducing a multi-layer conceptualization of polycentric digital ecosystems and demonstrates how AI-enabled infrastructures can be orchestrated to achieve digital integration in a fragmented, multipolar world.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence is creating a new global linguistic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, education, governance and socioeconomic equity, but its benefits remain concentrated in a small number of languages (Bender, 2019; Blasi et al., 2022; Joshi et al., 2020; Ranathunga and de Silva, 2022; Young, 2015). Language AI - the technologies that underpin widely-used conversational systems such as ChatGPT - could provide major benefits if available in people's native languages, yet most of the world's 7,000+ linguistic communities currently lack access and face persistent digital marginalization. Here we present a global longitudinal analysis of social, economic and infrastructural conditions across languages to assess systemic inequalities in language AI. We first analyze the existence of AI resources for 6003 languages. We find that despite efforts of the community to broaden the reach of language technologies (Bapna et al., 2022; Costa-Juss\`a et al., 2022), the dominance of a handful of languages is exacerbating disparities on an unprecedented scale, with divides widening exponentially rather than narrowing. Further, we contrast the longitudinal diffusion of AI with that of earlier IT technologies, revealing a distinctive hype-driven pattern of spread. To translate our findings into practical insights and guide prioritization efforts, we introduce the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE), which maps the state of technological, socio-economic, and infrastructural prerequisites for AI deployment across languages. The index highlights communities where capacity exists but remains underutilized, and provides a framework for accelerating more equitable diffusion of language AI. Our work contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards more sustainable and equitable language technologies.</description>

      <title>Methodological Variation in Studying Staff and Student Perceptions of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare methodological approaches for comparing student and staff perceptions, and ask: how much do these measures vary across different approaches? We focus on the case of AI perceptions, which are generally assessed via a single quantitative or qualitative measure, or with a mixed methods approach that compares two distinct data sources - e.g. a quantitative questionnaire with qualitative comments. To compare different approaches, we collect two forms of qualitative data: standalone comments and structured focus groups. We conduct two analyses for each data source: with a sentiment and stance analysis, we measure overall negativity/positivity of the comments and focus group conversations, respectively. Meanwhile, word clouds from the comments and a thematic analysis of the focus groups provide further detail on the content of this qualitative data - particularly the thematic analysis, which includes both similarities and differences between students and staff. We show that different analyses can produce different results - for a single data source. This variation stems from the construct being evaluated - an overall measure of positivity/negativity can produce a different picture from more detailed content-based analyses. We discuss the implications of this variation for institutional contexts, and for the comparisons from previous studies.</description>

      <title>Grok in the Wild: Characterizing the Roles and Uses of Large Language Models on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: xAI's large language model, Grok, is called by millions of people each week on the social media platform X. Prior work characterizing how large language models are used has focused on private, one-on-one interactions. Grok's deployment on X represents a major departure from this setting, with interactions occurring in a public social space. In this paper, we systematically sample three months of interaction data to investigate how, when, and to what effect Grok is used on X. At the platform level, we find that Grok responds to 62% of requests, that the majority (51%) are in English, and that engagement is low, with half of Grok's responses receiving 20 or fewer views after 48 hours. We also inductively build a taxonomy of 10 roles that LLMs play in mediating social interactions and use these roles to analyze 41,735 interactions with Grok on X. We find that Grok most often serves as an information provider but, in contrast to LLM use in private one-on-one settings, also takes on roles related to dispute management, such as truth arbiter, advocate, and adversary. Finally, we characterize the population of X users who prompted Grok and find that their self-expressed interests are closely related to the roles the model assumes in the corresponding interactions. Our findings provide an initial quantitative description of human-AI interactions on X, and a broader understanding of the diverse roles that large language models might play in our online social spaces.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Subjectivity and the "Ground Truth" Illusion in Data Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.</description>

      <title>Using predictive multiplicity to measure individual performance within the AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When building AI systems for decision support, one often encounters the phenomenon of predictive multiplicity: a single best model does not exist; instead, one can construct many models with similar overall accuracy that differ in their predictions for individual cases. Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $\delta$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice. (4) Ultimately, we suggest that information about predictive multiplicity should be made available to deployers under the AI Act, enabling them to judge whether system outputs for specific individuals are reliable enough for their use case.</description>

      <title>Wisdom of the LLM Crowd: A Large Scale Benchmark of Multi-Label U.S. Election-Related Harmful Social Media Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of election misinformation and harmful political content conveys misleading narratives and poses a serious threat to democratic integrity. Detecting harmful content at early stages is essential for understanding and potentially mitigating its downstream spread. In this study, we introduce USE24-XD, a large-scale dataset of nearly 100k posts collected from X (formerly Twitter) during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, enriched with spatio-temporal metadata. To substantially reduce the cost of manual annotation while enabling scalable categorization, we employ six large language models (LLMs) to systematically annotate posts across five nuanced categories: Conspiracy, Sensationalism, Hate Speech, Speculation, and Satire. We validate LLM annotations with crowdsourcing (n = 34) and benchmark them against human annotators. Inter-rater reliability analyses show comparable agreement patterns between LLMs and humans, with LLMs exhibiting higher internal consistency and achieving up to 0.90 recall on Speculation. We apply a wisdom-of-the-crowd approach across LLMs to aggregate annotations and curate a robust multi-label dataset. 60% of posts receive at least one label. We further analyze how human annotator demographics, including political ideology and affiliation, shape labeling behavior, highlighting systematic sources of subjectivity in judgments of harmful content. The USE24-XD dataset is publicly released to support future research.</description>

      <title>Neutral Prompts, Non-Neutral People: Quantifying Gender and Skin-Tone Bias in Gemini Flash 2.5 Image and GPT Image 1.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (&gt;96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.</description>

      <title>"Sorry, I Didn't Catch That": How Speech Models Miss What Matters Most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.</description>

      <title>Legitimate Overrides in Decentralized Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12260</link>

Abstract: Decentralized protocols claim immutable, rule-based execution, yet many embed emergency mechanisms such as chain-level freezes, protocol pauses, and account quarantines. These overrides are crucial for responding to exploits and systemic failures, but they expose a core tension: when does intervention preserve trust and when is it perceived as illegitimate discretion? With approximately $10$ billion in technical exploit losses potentially addressable by onchain intervention (2016--2026), the design of these mechanisms has high practical stakes, but current approaches remain ad hoc and ideologically charged. We address this gap by developing a Scope $\times$ Authority taxonomy that maps the design space of emergency architectures along two dimensions: the precision of the intervention and the concentration of trigger authority. We formalize the resulting tradeoffs of a standing centralization cost versus containment speed and collateral disruption as a stochastic cost-minimization problem; and derive three testable predictions. Assessing these predictions against 705 documented exploit incidents, we find that containment time varies systematically by authority type; that losses follow a heavy-tailed distribution ($\alpha \approx 1.33$) concentrating risk in rare catastrophic events; and that community sentiment measurably modulates the effective cost of maintaining intervention capability. The analysis yields concrete design principles that move emergency governance from ideological debate towards quantitative engineering.</description>

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these jobs are. In this paper, we present a data-driven analysis of global prompt engineering job trends on LinkedIn. We take a snapshot of the evolving AI workforce by analyzing 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We find that prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving (15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers. Our findings help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Trustworthiness of Legal Considerations for the Use of LLMs in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), becomes increasingly embedded in education systems worldwide, ensuring their ethical, legal, and contextually appropriate deployment has become a critical policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded, and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI integration across diverse educational environments.</description>

      <title>Eroding the Truth-Default: A Causal Analysis of Human Susceptibility to Foundation Model Hallucinations and Disinformation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) approach human-level fluency, distinguishing synthetic from organic content has become a key challenge for Trustworthy Web Intelligence.
  This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples "authenticity" from "attribution" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy.
  Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, "fake news familiarity" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a "fluency trap" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text.
  These findings suggest that "pre-bunking" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Toward Dignity-Aware AI: Next-Generation Elderly Monitoring from Fall Detection to ADL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper envisions a next-generation elderly monitoring system that moves beyond fall detection toward the broader goal of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition. Our ultimate aim is to design privacy-preserving, edge-deployed, and federated AI systems that can robustly detect and understand daily routines, supporting independence and dignity in aging societies. At present, ADL-specific datasets are still under collection. As a preliminary step, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments using the SISFall dataset and its GAN-augmented variants, treating fall detection as a proxy task. We report initial results on federated learning with non-IID conditions, and embedded deployment on Jetson Orin Nano devices. We then outline open challenges such as domain shift, data scarcity, and privacy risks, and propose directions toward full ADL monitoring in smart-room environments. This work highlights the transition from single-task detection to comprehensive daily activity recognition, providing both early evidence and a roadmap for sustainable and human-centered elderly care AI.</description>

      <title>DSO: Direct Steering Optimization for Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.</description>

      <title>Exploring Silicon-Based Societies: An Early Study of the Moltbook Agent Community</title>

Abstract: The rapid emergence of autonomous large language model agents has given rise to persistent, large-scale agent ecosystems whose collective behavior cannot be adequately understood through anecdotal observation or small-scale simulation. This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Mathematics Research</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest quantifying standard levels of autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results, as well as propose a novel concept of human-AI interaction cards for transparency. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics and share all prompts as well as model outputs at https://github.com/google-deepmind/superhuman/tree/main/aletheia.</description>
