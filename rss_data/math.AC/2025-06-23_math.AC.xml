      <title>On the minimum number of Toeplitz factors of a matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We disprove a conjecture by Ye and Lim, by showing that there are $3 \times 3$ complex matrices which can't be expressed as the product of two Toeplitz matrices of the same size. We also improve previous estimates by Ye and Lim on the minimum number of Toeplitz matrices needed to factor any $n \times n$ matrix, for low values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Affine semigroups without consecutive small elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\mathcal{A}$-semigroup is a numerical semigroup without consecutive small elements. This work generalizes this concept to finite-complement submonoids of an affine cone $\mathcal{C}$. We develop algorithmic procedures to compute all $\mathcal{A}$-semigroups with a given Frobenius element (denoted by $\mathcal{A}(f)$), and with fixed Frobenius element and multiplicity. Moreover, we analyze the $\mathcal{A}(f)$-systems of generators. Furthermore, we study $\mathcal{A}$-numerical semigroups with maximal embedding dimension, fixed Frobenius number and multiplicity, providing an algorithm for their computation and a graphical classification.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Geometric rank in Terms of Subrank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For tensors of fixed order, we establish three types of upper bounds for the geometric rank in terms of the subrank. Firstly, we prove that, under a mild condition on the characteristic of the base field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank in some field extension of bounded degree. Secondly, we show that, over any algebraically closed field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank. Lastly, we prove that, for any order three tensor over an arbitrary field, its geometric rank is bounded by a quadratic polynomial in its subrank. Our results have several immediate but interesting implications: (1) We answer an open question posed by Kopparty, Moshkovitz and Zuiddam concerning the relation between the subrank and the geometric rank; (2) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi-Chang- Draisma-Rupniewski (resp. Derksen-Makam-Zuiddam) theorem on the growth rate of the border subrank (resp. subrank), in an optimal way; (3) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi- Draisma-Eggleston theorem on the stability of the subrank, from the real field to an arbitrary field; (4) We confirm the open problem raised by Derksen, Makam and Zuiddam on the maximality of the gap between the subrank of the direct sum and the sum of subranks; (5) We derive, for the first time, a de-bordering result for the border subrank and upper bounds for the partition rank and analytic rank in terms of the subrank; (6) We reprove a gap result for the subrank.</description>

      <title>The Laplacian matrix of weighted threshold graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Threshold graphs are generated from one node by repeatedly adding a node that links to all existing nodes or adding a node without links. In the weighted threshold graph, we add a new node in step $i$, which is linked to all existing nodes by a link of weight $w_i$. In this work, we consider the set ${\cal A}_N$ that contains all Laplacian matrices of weighted threshold graphs of order $N$. We show that ${\cal A}_N$ forms a commutative algebra. Using this, we find a common basis of eigenvectors for the matrices in ${\cal A}_N$. It follows that the eigenvalues of each matrix in ${\cal A}_N$ can be represented as a linear transformation of the link weights. In addition, we prove that, if there are just three or fewer different weights, two weighted threshold graphs with the same Laplacian spectrum must be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Counter-example to Conjectures on Complemented Zero-Divisor Graphs of Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are motivated by two conjectures proposed by C. Bender et al.\ in 2024, which have remained open questions. The first conjecture states that if the complemented zero-divisor graph \( G(S) \) of a commutative semigroup \( S \) with a zero element has the clique number three or greater, then the reduced graph \( G_r(S) \) is isomorphic to the graph \( G(\mathcal{P}(n)) \). The second conjecture asserts that if \( G(S) \) is a complemented zero-divisor graph with the clique number three or greater, then \( G(S) \) is uniquely complemented.
  In this work, we construct a commutative semigroup \( S \) with a zero element that serves as a counter-example to both conjectures.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>
