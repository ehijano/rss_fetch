      <title>Chow groups with twisted coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rost defined the Chow group of algebraic cycles with coefficients in a locally constant torsion etale sheaf. We generalize the definition to allow non-torsion coefficients. Chow groups with twisted coefficients are related to Serre's notion of "negligible cohomology" for finite groups. We generalize a computation by Merkurjev and Scavia of negligible cohomology, in terms of twisted Chow groups.
  We compute the Chow groups of the classifying space BG with coefficients in an arbitrary G-module, for several finite groups G (cyclic, quaternion, ${\bf Z}/2\times {\bf Z}/2$). There are connections with the theory of algebraic tori, notably the concept of coflasque resolutions. We compare twisted Chow groups with twisted motivic cohomology as defined by Heller-Voineagu-Ostvaer. Surprisingly, there is a surjection from twisted motivic cohomology to twisted Chow groups, but it is not always an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Eightfold Degenerate Dirac Nodal Line in Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn$_5$Si$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electronic, magnetic, and spin transport properties of the orthorhombic Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ compound in the $AF2$ phase using symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations. Our ground state energy calculations align with experimental observations, demonstrating that the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, with N\'{e}el vector in the [010] direction, is the most stable magnetic configuration both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a bulk lattice geometry. We identified an unconventional eight-fold degenerate Dirac nodal line (DNL) close to the Fermi level, characterized by negligible SOC. This DNL is robustly protected by a unique combination of a pure-spin symmetry and a lattice symmetry together with magnetic space group symmetries. Upon introducing SOC, this degeneracy is reduced to two four-fold DNLs, being protected by the combination of time-reversal, partial translation and nonsymmorphic symmetries within the magnetic space group. We predict also a large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) which correlates with the presence of SOC-induced splitting of these eight-fold degenerate DNLs near the Fermi level. These intriguing characteristics position collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ as a compelling candidate for spintronic applications, particularly in the generation and detection of spin currents, while remaining compatible with modern silicon technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we show that the McCool group does not satisfy the Andreadakis equality from degree $7$, and we give a lower bound for the size of the difference between the two relevant filtrations. As a consequence, we see that the Andreadakis problem for the McCool group does not stabilize.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed, 3-connected, 8-dimensional smooth manifold. In this paper, we compute the concordance inertia group of the product manifold $M\times\mathbb{S}^k$ for $1\leq k\leq 14$ and classify all smooth manifolds homeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^k,$ up to concordance for $1\leq k\leq 10.$ Moreover, we provide a diffeomorphism classification of smooth manifolds homeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1,$ where $H^4(M;\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>Extremal Betti Numbers and Persistence in Flag Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate several problems concerning extremal Betti numbers and persistence in filtrations of flag complexes. For graphs on $n$ vertices, we show that $\beta_k(X(G))$ is maximal when $G=\mathcal{T}_{n,k+1}$, the Tur\'an graph on $k+1$ partition classes, where $X(G)$ denotes the flag complex of $G$. Building on this, we construct an edgewise (one edge at a time) filtration $\mathcal{G}=G_1\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{n,k+1}$ for which $\beta_k(X(G_i))$ is maximal for all graphs on $n$ vertices and $i$ edges. Moreover, the persistence barcode $\mathcal{B}_k(X(G))$ achieves a maximal number of intervals, and total persistence, among all edgewise filtrations with $|E(\mathcal{T}_{n,k+1})|$ edges.
  For $k=1$, we consider edgewise filtrations of the complete graph $K_n$. We show that the maximal number of intervals in the persistence barcode is obtained precisely when $G_{\lceil n/2\rceil \cdot \lfloor n/2 \rfloor}=\mathcal{T}_{n,2}$. Among such filtrations, we characterize those achieving maximal total persistence. We further show that no filtration can optimize $\beta_1(X(G_i))$ for all $i$, and conjecture that our filtrations maximize the total persistence over all edgewise filtrations of $K_n$.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Persistent Cycles for Levelset Zigzag on Manifold-like Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In standard persistent homology, a persistent cycle born and dying with a persistence interval (bar) associates the bar with a concrete topological representative, which provides means to effectively navigate back from the barcode to the topological space. Among the possibly many, optimal persistent cycles bring forth further information due to having guaranteed quality. However, topological features usually go through variations in the lifecycle of a bar which a single persistent cycle may not capture. Hence, for persistent homology induced from PL functions, we propose levelset persistent cycles consisting of a sequence of cycles that depict the evolution of homological features from birth to death. Our definition is based on levelset zigzag persistence which involves four types of persistence intervals as opposed to the two types in standard persistence. For each of the four types, we present a polynomial-time algorithm computing an optimal sequence of levelset persistent $p$-cycles for the so-called weak $(p+1)$-pseudomanifolds. Given that optimal cycle problems for homology are NP-hard in general, our results are useful in practice because weak pseudomanifolds do appear in applications. Our algorithms draw upon an idea of relating optimal cycles to min-cuts in a graph that was exploited earlier for standard persistent cycles. Notice that levelset zigzag poses non-trivial challenges for the approach because a sequence of optimal cycles instead of a single one needs to be computed in this case. We show some empirical evidence that optimal cycles produced by our implemented software have nice quality.</description>

      <title>Bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and abelian varieties, and unstable cohomology of $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and of tropical abelian varieties, and show that the tropical Torelli map extends to their bordifications. We prove that the classical bi-invariant differential forms studied by Cartan and others extend to these bordifications by studying their behaviour at infinity, and consequently deduce infinitely many new non-zero unstable cohomology classes in the cohomology of the general and special linear groups $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we obtain a new and geometric proof of Borel's theorem on the stable cohomology of these groups.
  In addition, we completely determine the cohomology of the link of the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties within a certain range, and show that it contains the stable cohomology of the general linear group.
  In the process, we define new transcendental invariants associated to the minimal vectors of quadratic forms, and also show that a certain part of the cohomology of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ admits the structure of a motive.
  In an appendix, we give an algebraic construction of the Borel-Serre compactification by embedding it in the real points of an iterated blow-up of a projective space along linear subspaces, which may have independent applications.</description>

      <title>Definable functors between triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop the theory of definable functors between compactly generated triangulated categories. Such functors preserve pure triangles, pure injective objects, and definable subcategories, and as such appear in a wide range of algebraic and topological settings. Firstly we investigate and characterise purity preserving functors from a triangulated category into a finitely accessible category with products, which we term coherent functors. This yields a new property for the restricted Yoneda embedding as the universal coherent functor. We build upon the utility of coherent functors to provide several equivalent conditions for an additive, not necessarily triangulated, functor between triangulated categories to be definable: a functor is definable if and only if it preserves filtered homology colimits and products, if and only if it uniquely extends along the restricted Yoneda embedding to a definable functor between the corresponding module categories. We apply these results to the functoriality of the Ziegler spectrum, an object of study in pure homological algebra and representation theory.</description>
