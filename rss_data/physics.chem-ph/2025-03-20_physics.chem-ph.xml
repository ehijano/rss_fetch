      <title>Deep quantum Monte Carlo approach for polaritonic chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schr\"odinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to map simulated noisy and laser-limited multidimensional spectra to molecular electronic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has enabled significant discoveries in both biological and synthetic energy-transducing systems. Although deriving chemical information from 2DES is a complex task, machine learning (ML) offers exciting opportunities to translate complicated spectroscopic data into physical insight. Recent studies have found that neural networks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale properties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture experimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and suboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental utility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated with experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map simulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By systematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000 simulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for spectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (&gt; 6.6 if background noise dominates vs. &gt; 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to human-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves significantly (ca. 84% $\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the bandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent with the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of molecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting simulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently imperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned perspectives of nonlinear spectroscopic data may produce unique and, perhaps, counterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.</description>

      <title>A Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) approach for molecules in QED environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multireference systems are usually challenging to investigate using ab initio methods as they require an accurate description of static electron correlation. The urgency of developing similar approaches is even more pressing when molecules strongly interact with light in quantum-electrodynamics (QED) environments. In fact, in this context, multireference effects might be induced or reduced by the presence of the field. In this work, we extend the Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) approach to polaritonic systems. The method is tested on benchmark multireference problems and applied to investigate field-induced effects on the electronic structure of well-known multiconfigurational processes. We analyze the strengths and limitations of the method with particular attention to the appearance of possible origin dependencies.</description>

      <title>Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems: The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently developed the \textit{constraint} coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$. It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</description>

      <title>A Non-Hermitian State-to-State Analysis of Transport in Aggregates with Multiple Endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiency of quantum transport through aggregates with multiple end-points or traps proves to be an emergent and a highly non-equilibrium phenomenon. We present a numerically exact approach for computing the emergent time scale and amount of extraction specific to particular traps leveraging a non-Hermitian generalization of the recently introduced state-to-state transport analysis [Bose and Walters, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 15, 4828-4836]. This method is able to simultaneously account for the coupling between various sites, the many-body effects brought in by the vibrations and environment held at a non-zero temperature, and the local extraction processes described by non-Hermitian terms in the Hamiltonian. In fact, our non-Hermitian state-to-state analysis goes beyond merely providing an emergent loss time-scale. It can parse the entire dynamics into the constituent internal transport pathways and loss to environment. We demonstrate this method using examples of an exciton transport in a lossy polaritonic cavity. The loss at the cavity and the extraction of the exciton from a terminal molecule provide competing mechanisms that our method helps to unravel, revealing extremely interesting non-intuitive physics. This non-Hermitian state-to-state analysis technique contributes an important link in understanding and elucidating the routes of transport in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinear ion dynamics in polymer electrolytes from the perspective of hopping models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relevant information about the nature of the dynamics of ions in electrolytes can be obtained by studying the nonlinear dependence on an applied electric field. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the field effects for a polymer electrolyte, i.e. a mixture of PEO with Li-TFSI salt, for a range of different temperatures and salt contents. Specifically, the effects of the electric field on the current and the diffusivities parallel and orthogonal to the electric fields are analyzed. It is argued that the nonlinear effects in the weak-field regime provide information about the nature of the disorder. In contrast, the nonlinear effects in the high-field regime allow one to extract effective hopping distances. They are in close agreement with typical nearest-neighbor length scales obtained from detailed structural analysis and are hardly dependent on the salt content. Furthermore, from the study of the temperature dependence in the high-field regime, effective barrier heights can be determined, which in this regime decrease linearly with increasing field. The disappearance of the effective barriers, estimated by linear extrapolation, occurs close to the fields where the MD simulations start to be numerically unstable. Finally, the interpretation is supported by a comparison with analytically known solutions of disordered hopping models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and fluctuations in mesoscopic stochastic simulations of reactive gas mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is essential that mesoscopic simulations of reactive systems reproduce the correct statistical distributions at thermodynamic equilibrium. By considering a compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) simulation method of ideal gas mixtures undergoing reversible reactions described by the chemical Langevin equations, we show that thermodynamic consistency in reaction rates and the use of instantaneous temperatures for the evaluation of reaction rates is required for fluctuations for the overall system to be correct. We then formulate the required properties of a thermodynamically-consistent reaction (TCR) model. As noted in the literature, while reactions are often discussed in terms of forward and reverse rates, these rates should not be modeled independently because they must be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Using a simple TCR model where each chemical species has constant heat capacity, we derive the explicit condition that the forward and reverse reaction rate constants must satisfy in order for the system to be thermodynamically consistent. We perform equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of ideal gas mixtures undergoing a reversible dimerization reaction to measure the fluctuational behavior of the system numerically. We confirm that FHD simulations with the TCR model give the correct static structure factor of equilibrium fluctuations. For the statistically steady simulation of a gas mixture between two isothermal walls with different temperatures, we show using the TCR model that the temperature variance agrees with the corresponding thermodynamic-equilibrium temperature variance in the interior of the system, whereas noticeable deviations are present in regions near walls, where chemistry is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</description>

      <title>GraphXForm: Graph transformer for computer-aided molecular design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative deep learning has become pivotal in molecular design for drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</description>
