      <title>Using a Single-Parity-Check to reduce the Guesswork of Guessing Codeword Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD) is a recently proposed soft-input forward error correction decoder for arbitrary linear forward error correction codes. Inspired by recent proposals that leverage binary linear codebook structure to reduce the number of queries made by Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND), for binary linear codes that include one full single parity-check (SPC) bit, we show that it is possible to reduce the number of queries made by GCD by a factor of up to 2 without impacting decoding precision. The greatest guesswork reduction is realized at lower SNRs, where the decoder output is usually correct but guesswork is most burdensome. Codes without a SPC can be modified to include one by swapping a column of the generator matrix for an all-ones column to obtain a decoding complexity advantage, and we demonstrate that this can often be done without losing decoding precision. To practically avail of the complexity advantage, a noise effect pattern generator capable of producing sequences for given Hamming weights, such as the one underlying ORBGRAND, is necessary.</description>

      <title>Power Allocation for Compute-and-Forward over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compute-and-forward (CF) is a relaying strategy which allows the relay to decode a linear combination of the transmitted messages. This work studies the optimal power allocation problem for the CF scheme in fast fading channels for maximizing the symmetric computation rate, which is a non-convex optimization problem with no simple analytical or numerical solutions. In the first part of the paper, we investigate the problem when there are finitely many channel states (discrete case). We establish several important properties of the optimal solutions and show that if all users share the same power allocation policy (symmetric policy), the optimal solution takes the form of a water-filling type when the power constraint exceeds a certain threshold. However, if asymmetric policies are allowed, the optimal solution does not take this form for any power constraint. We propose a low-complexity order-based algorithm for both scenarios and compare its performance with baseline algorithms. In the second part of the paper, we state relevant results when the channel coefficients are modelled as continuous random variables (continuous case) and propose a similar low-complexity iterative algorithm for the symmetric policy scenario. Numerical results are provided for both discrete and continuous cases. It is shown that in general our proposed algorithm finds good suboptimal solutions with low complexity, and for some examples considered, finds an exact optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions with Structured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of signal processing, phase transition phenomena have recently attracted great attention. Donoho's work established the signal recovery threshold using indicators such as restricted isotropy (RIP) and incoherence and proved that phase transition phenomena occur in compressed sampling. Nevertheless, the phase transition phenomenon of structured sparse signals remains unclear, and these studies mainly focused on simple sparse signals. Signals with a specific structure, such as the block or tree structures common in real-world applications, are called structured sparse signals. The objectives of this article are to study the phase transition phenomenon of structured sparse signals and to investigate how structured sparse signals affect the phase transition threshold. It begins with a summary of the common subspace of structured sparse signals and the theory of high-dimensional convex polytope random projections. Next, the strong threshold expression of block-structured and tree-structured sparse signals is derived after examining the weak and strong thresholds of structured sparse signals.</description>

      <title>Jointly Optimizing Power Allocation and Device Association for Robust IoT Networks under Infeasible Circumstances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jointly optimizing power allocation and device association is crucial in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks to ensure devices achieve their data throughput requirements. Device association, which assigns IoT devices to specific access points (APs), critically impacts resource allocation. Many existing works often assume all data throughput requirements are satisfied, which is impractical given resource limitations and diverse demands. When requirements cannot be met, the system becomes infeasible, causing congestion and degraded performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework to enhance IoT system robustness by solving two problems, comprising maximizing the number of satisfied IoT devices and jointly maximizing both the number of satisfied devices and total network throughput. These objectives often conflict under infeasible circumstances, necessitating a careful balance. We thus propose a modified branch-and-bound (BB)-based method to solve the first problem. An iterative algorithm is proposed for the second problem that gradually increases the number of satisfied IoT devices and improves the total network throughput. We employ a logarithmic approximation for a lower bound on data throughput and design a fixed-point algorithm for power allocation, followed by a coalition game-based method for device association. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, serving fewer devices than the BB-based method but with faster running time and higher total throughput.</description>

      <title>Private Counterfactual Retrieval With Immutable Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a classification task, counterfactual explanations provide the minimum change needed for an input to be classified into a favorable class. We consider the problem of privately retrieving the exact closest counterfactual from a database of accepted samples while enforcing that certain features of the input sample cannot be changed, i.e., they are \emph{immutable}. An applicant (user) whose feature vector is rejected by a machine learning model wants to retrieve the sample closest to them in the database without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set. While doing this, the user should keep their feature vector, immutable set and the resulting counterfactual index information-theoretically private from the institution. We refer to this as immutable private counterfactual retrieval (I-PCR) problem which generalizes PCR to a more practical setting. In this paper, we propose two I-PCR schemes by leveraging techniques from private information retrieval (PIR) and characterize their communication costs. Further, we quantify the information that the user learns about the database and compare it for the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Early-Scheduled Handover Preparation in 5G NR Millimeter-Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The handover (HO) procedure is one of the most critical functions in a cellular network driven by measurements of the user channel of the serving and neighboring cells. The success rate of the entire HO procedure is significantly affected by the preparation stage. As massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems with large antenna arrays allow resolving finer details of channel behavior, we investigate how machine learning can be applied to time series data of beam measurements in the Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) system to improve the HO procedure. This paper introduces the Early-Scheduled Handover Preparation scheme designed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the HO procedure, particularly in scenarios involving high mobility and dense small cell deployments. Early-Scheduled Handover Preparation focuses on optimizing the timing of the HO preparation phase by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the earliest possible trigger points for HO events. We identify a new early trigger for HO preparation and demonstrate how it can beneficially reduce the required time for HO execution reducing channel quality degradation. These insights enable a new HO preparation scheme that offers a novel, user-aware, and proactive HO decision making in MIMO scenarios incorporating mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores communication over a two-sender, two-receiver classical interference channel, enhanced by the availability of entanglement resources between transmitters. The central contribution are an inner and outer bound on the capacity region for a general interference channel with entangled transmitters. It addresses the persistent challenge of the lack of a general capacity formula, even in the purely classical case, and highlights the striking similarities in achievable rate expressions when assessing quantum advantages. Through a concrete example, it is shown that entanglement can significantly boost performance in certain types of channels.</description>

      <title>Explicit constructions of optimal blocking sets and minimal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong $s$-blocking set in a projective space is a set of points that intersects each codimension-$s$ subspace in a spanning set of the subspace. We present an explicit construction of such sets in a $(k - 1)$-dimensional projective space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of size $O_s(q^s k)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor depending on $s$. This also yields an optimal explicit construction of affine blocking sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^k$ with respect to codimension-$(s+1)$ affine subspaces, and of $s$-minimal codes. Our approach is motivated by a recent construction of Alon, Bishnoi, Das, and Neri of strong $1$-blocking sets, which uses expander graphs with a carefully chosen set of vectors as their vertex set. The main novelty of our work lies in constructing specific hypergraphs on top of these expander graphs, where tree-like configurations correspond to strong $s$-blocking sets. We also discuss some connections to size-Ramsey numbers of hypergraphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Path Assignment in Mesh Networks at the Edge of Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mesh network at the edge of a wireless network that connects users with the core network via multiple base stations. For this scenario we present a novel tree-search based algorithm that determines the optimal communication path to the core network for each user by maximizing the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) for each chosen path. We show that for three mesh networks with differing sizes, our algorithm chooses paths whose minimum SNIR is 3 dB to 18 dB better than that obtained via an algorithm that disregards the effect of interference within the network, 16 dB to 20 dB better than a random algorithm that chooses the paths randomly, and 0.5 dB to 7 dB better compared to a recently introduced genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we show that our algorithm has a lower complexity compared to the GA in networks where its performance is within 2 dB.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Task-Oriented Communications with Multi-Round, Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address task-oriented (or goal-oriented) communications where an encoder at the transmitter learns compressed latent representations of data, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder performs a machine learning task, specifically for classifying the received signals. The deep neural networks corresponding to the encoder-decoder pair are jointly trained, taking both channel and data characteristics into account. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy in completing the underlying task while minimizing the number of channel uses determined by the encoder's output size. To this end, we propose a multi-round, multi-task learning (MRMTL) approach for the dynamic update of channel uses in multi-round transmissions. The transmitter incrementally sends an increasing number of encoded samples over the channel based on the feedback from the receiver, and the receiver utilizes the signals from a previous round to enhance the task performance, rather than only considering the latest transmission. This approach employs multi-task learning to jointly optimize accuracy across varying number of channel uses, treating each configuration as a distinct task. By evaluating the confidence of the receiver in task decisions, MRMTL decides on whether to allocate additional channel uses in multiple rounds. We characterize both the accuracy and the delay (total number of channel uses) of MRMTL, demonstrating that it achieves the accuracy close to that of conventional methods requiring large numbers of channel uses, but with reduced delay by incorporating signals from a prior round. We consider the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural network architectures, and AWGN and Rayleigh channel models for performance evaluation. We show that MRMTL significantly improves the efficiency of task-oriented communications, balancing accuracy and latency effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Boosted Neural Decoders: Achieving Extreme Reliability of LDPC Codes for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring extremely high reliability in channel coding is essential for 6G networks. The next-generation of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) scenario within 6G networks requires frame error rate (FER) below $10^{-9}$. However, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, the standard in 5G new radio (NR), encounter a challenge known as the error floor phenomenon, which hinders to achieve such low rates. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative solution: boosted neural min-sum (NMS) decoder. This decoder operates identically to conventional NMS decoders, but is trained by novel training methods including: i) boosting learning with uncorrected vectors, ii) block-wise training schedule to address the vanishing gradient issue, iii) dynamic weight sharing to minimize the number of trainable weights, iv) transfer learning to reduce the required sample count, and v) data augmentation to expedite the sampling process. Leveraging these training strategies, the boosted NMS decoder achieves the state-of-the art performance in reducing the error floor as well as superior waterfall performance. Remarkably, we fulfill the 6G xURLLC requirement for 5G LDPC codes without a severe error floor. Additionally, the boosted NMS decoder, once its weights are trained, can perform decoding without additional modules, making it highly practical for immediate application. The source code is available at https://github.com/ghy1228/LDPC_Error_Floor.</description>

Abstract: We use algebraic invariant theory to study three weight enumerators of formally self-dual quantum codes over any finite fields. We show that the weight enumerator of a formally self-dual quantum code can be expressed algebraically by two polynomials and the double weight enumerator of a formally self-dual quantum code can be expressed algebraically by five polynomials. We also explicitly compute the complete weight enumerators of some special formally self-dual quantum codes. Our approach avoids applying the well-known Molien's formula and demonstrates the potential of employing algebraic invariant theory to compute weight enumerators of quantum codes.</description>

      <title>OTFS-MDMA: An Elastic Multi-Domain Resource Utilization Mechanism for High Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By harnessing the delay-Doppler (DD) resource domain, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) substantially improves the communication performance under high-mobility scenarios by maintaining quasi-time-invariant channel characteristics. However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements. Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision. Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference. Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency. Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, access scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints. Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints. Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.</description>

Abstract: Massive communication is one of key scenarios of 6G where two magnitude higher connection density would be required to serve diverse services. As a promising direction, unsourced multiple access has been proved to outperform significantly over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or slotted-ALOHA in massive connections. In this paper we describe a design framework of unsourced sparse multiple access (USMA) that consists of two key modules: compressed sensing for preamble generation, and sparse interleaver division multiple access (SIDMA) for main packet transmission. Simulation results of general design of USMA show that the theoretical bound can be approached within 1~1.5 dB by using simple channel codes like convolutional. To illustrate the scalability of USMA, a customized design for ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) is proposed, so that much less memory and computation are required. Simulations results of Rayleigh fading and realistic channel estimation show that USMA based A-IoT solution can deliver nearly 4 times capacity and 6 times efficiency for random access over traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pilot Design for OTFS in Linear Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the positioning of the pilot symbols, as well as the power distribution between the pilot and the communication symbols in the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. We analyze the pilot placements that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in estimating the channel taps. This allows us to identify two new pilot allocations for OTFS. In addition, we optimize the average channel capacity by adjusting the power balance. We show that this leads to a significant increase in average capacity. The results provide valuable guidance for designing the OTFS parameters to achieve maximum capacity. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal tradeoffs for estimating Pauli observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of Pauli shadow tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, estimate $\text{tr}(P\rho)$ for some set of Pauli operators $P$ to within additive error $\epsilon$. This has been a popular testbed for exploring the advantage of protocols with quantum memory over those without: with enough memory to measure two copies at a time, one can use Bell sampling to estimate $|\text{tr}(P\rho)|$ for all $P$ using $O(n/\epsilon^4)$ copies, but with $k\le n$ qubits of memory, $\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ copies are needed.
  These results leave open several natural questions. How does this picture change in the physically relevant setting where one only needs to estimate a certain subset of Paulis? What is the optimal dependence on $\epsilon$? What is the optimal tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity?
  We answer all of these questions. For any subset $A$ of Paulis and any family of measurement strategies, we completely characterize the optimal sample complexity, up to $\log |A|$ factors. We show any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements must make $\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ measurements. For any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements and only has $k &lt; n$ qubits of memory, we show that $\widetilde{\Theta}(\min\{2^n/\epsilon^2, 2^{n-k}/\epsilon^4\})$ copies are necessary and sufficient.
  The protocols we propose can also estimate the actual values $\text{tr}(P\rho)$, rather than just their absolute values as in prior work. Additionally, as a byproduct of our techniques, we establish tight bounds for the task of purity testing and show that it exhibits an intriguing phase transition not present in the memory-sample tradeoff for Pauli shadow tomography.</description>
