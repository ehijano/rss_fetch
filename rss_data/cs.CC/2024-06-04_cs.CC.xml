      <title>On the completeness of several fortification-interdiction games in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fortification-interdiction games are tri-level adversarial games where two opponents act in succession to protect, disrupt and simply use an infrastructure for a specific purpose. Many such games have been formulated and tackled in the literature through specific algorithmic methods, however very few investigations exist on the completeness of such fortification problems in order to locate them rigorously in the polynomial hierarchy. We clarify the completeness status of several well-known fortification problems, such as the Tri-level Interdiction Knapsack Problem with unit fortification and attack weights, the Max-flow Interdiction Problem and Shortest Path Interdiction Problem with Fortification, the Multi-level Critical Node Problem with unit weights, as well as a well-studied electric grid defence planning problem. For all of these problems, we prove their completeness either for the $\Sigma^p_2$ or the $\Sigma^p_3$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. We also prove that the Multi-level Fortification-Interdiction Knapsack Problem with an arbitrary number of protection and interdiction rounds and unit fortification and attack weights is complete for any level of the polynomial hierarchy, therefore providing a useful basis for further attempts at proving the completeness of protection-interdiction games at any level of said hierarchy.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Terminal Monitoring Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Terminal Monitoring Set (TMS), the input is an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a collection $T$ of terminal pairs and the goal is to find a subset $S$ of minimum size that hits a shortest path between every pair of terminals. We show that this problem is W[2]-hard with respect to solution size. On the positive side, we show that TMS is fixed parameter tractable with respect to solution size plus distance to cluster, solution size plus neighborhood diversity, and feedback edge number. For the weighted version of the problem, we obtain a FPT algorithm with respect to vertex cover number, and for a relaxed version of the problem, we show that it is W[1]-hard with respect to solution size plus feedback vertex number.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of 2-Dimensional Recurrence Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates how a 2-dimensional recurrence problem can be reduced to a mono-dimensional recurrence problem where the Kogge and Stone algorithm is applicable, with the computation time - excluding the reduction step - becoming proportional to $log_2(2n-1)$.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of Matrix Partitions : Complexity and Obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A trigraph is a graph where each pair of vertices is labelled either 0 (a non-arc), 1 (an arc) or $\star$ (both an arc and a non-arc). In a series of papers, Hell and co-authors proposed to study the complexity of homomorphisms from graphs to trigraphs, called Matrix Partition Problems, where arcs and non-arcs can be both mapped to $\star$-arcs, while a non-arc cannot be mapped to an arc, and vice-versa. Even though Matrix Partition Problems are generalisations of CSPs, they share with them the property of being ``intrinsically'' combinatorial. So, the question of a possible P-time vs NP-complete dichotomy is a very natural one and was raised in Hell et al.'s papers. We propose a generalisation of Matrix Partitions to relational structures and study them with respect to the question of a dichotomy. We first show that trigraph homomorphisms and Matrix Partitions are P-time equivalent, and then prove that one can also restrict (with respect to having a dichotomy) to relational structures with a single relation. Failing in proving that Matrix Partitions on directed graphs are not P-time equivalent to Matrix Partitions on relational structures, we give some evidence that it might be unlikely by formalising the reductions used in the case of CSPs and by showing that such reductions cannot work for the case of Matrix Partitions. We then turn our attention to Matrix Partitions that can be described by finite sets of (induced-subgraph) obstructions. We show, in particular, that any such problem has finitely many minimal obstructions if and only if it has finite duality. We conclude by showing that on trees (seen as trigraphs) it is NP-complete to decide whether a given tree has a homomorphism to another input trigraph. The latter shows a notable difference on tractability between CSP and Matrix Partitions as it is well-known that CSP is tractable on the class of trees.</description>

      <title>Transductive Sample Complexities Are Compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $H$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to any proper metric loss function (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</description>
