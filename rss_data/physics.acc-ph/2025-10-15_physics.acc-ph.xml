      <title>Digital Low-Level RF system for the Linac Electronics Modernization Plan at LCLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LCLS began operations in 2009, utilizing SLAC's normal-conducting (NC) LINAC, which features control equipment dating back to the 1960s and 1980s. The Linac Electronics Modernization Plan (LEMP) aims to replace the legacy control equipment with a system based on the open-source Marble carrier board and Zest+ digitizer board, both of which are used in the LCLS-II HE LLRF system. Adaptation of the LLRF system developed for the continuous-wave (CW) superconducting RF (SRF) LCLS-II to the short-RF pulse NC LCLS includes leveraging the knowledge and experience gained from recent LLRF projects at SLAC and efficiently reusing the core functionality of the hardware and code base developed for previous projects, in collaboration with LBNL, FNAL and JLAB. A prototype has been deployed and tested at station 26-3, demonstrating RF generation/control, interlocks, triggers, and waveform capture. Here, we describe the hardware, firmware and software infrastructure, highlight key features, and present initial test results.</description>

      <title>Intense and Tunable Multi-color Terahertz Radiation from Laser-Shaped Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power multi-color terahertz (THz) radiation exhibits extraordinary scientific application prospects at various scientific frontiers, for its capacity to deliver THz excitation at multiple frequencies simultaneously. However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser. This method paves the way for advanced application of THz pump-THz probe experiments for selective excitation of atomic multi-level systems and molecular fingerprint recognition.</description>

      <title>A double multi-turn injection scheme for generating mixed helium and carbon ion beams at medical synchrotron facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low relative charge-to-mass ratio offset of 0.065% between fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enables simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently "mixing" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double multi-turn injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.</description>

      <title>AttoSHINE: Generation of continuous-wave terawatt-scale attosecond X-ray pulses at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.</description>
