      <title>A Lightweight Cubature Kalman Filter for Attitude and Heading Reference Systems Using Simplified Prediction Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRSs) are broadly applied wherever reliable orientation and motion sensing is required. In this paper, we present an improved Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) with lower computational cost while maintaining estimation accuracy, which is named "Kaisoku Cubature Kalman Filter (KCKF)". The computationally efficient equations of the KCKF are derived by simplifying those of the CKF, while preserving equivalent mathematical relations. The lightweight prediction equations in the KCKF are derived by expanding the summation terms in the CKF and simplifying the result. This paper shows that the KCKF requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than the CKF. The controlled experimental results show that the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 19% compared to the CKF on a high-performance computer, whereas the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 15% compared to the CKF on a low-cost single-board computer. In addition, the KCKF maintains the attitude estimation accuracy of the CKF.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation of Articulated Components in Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of intelligent civil infrastructure and smart cities, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) increasingly requires safe, efficient, and energy-conscious robotic manipulation of articulated components, including access doors, service drawers, and pipeline valves. However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&amp;M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&amp;M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&amp;M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&amp;M manipulation.</description>

      <title>String-Level Ground Fault Localization for TN-Earthed Three-Phase Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DC-side ground fault (GF) poses significant risks to three-phase TN-earthed photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the resulting high fault current can directly damage both PV inverters and PV modules. Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive traffic signal control optimization using a novel road partition and multi-channel state representation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel adaptive traffic signal control method leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize signal timing by integrating variable cell length and multi-channel state representation. A road partition formula consisting of the sum of logarithmic and linear functions was proposed. The state variables are a vector composed of three channels: the number of vehicles, the average speed, and space occupancy. The set of available signal phases constitutes the action space, the selected phase is executed with a fixed green time. The reward function is formulated using the absolute values of key traffic state metrics - waiting time, speed, and fuel consumption. Each metric is normalized by a typical maximum value and assigned a weight that reflects its priority and optimization direction. The simulation results, using Sumo-TensorFlow-Python, demonstrate a cross-range transferability evaluation and show that the proposed variable cell length and multi-channel state representation method excels compared to fixed cell length in optimization performance.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-Inspired Closure Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrier certificates, a form of state invariants, provide an automated approach to the verification of the safety of dynamical systems. Similarly to barrier certificates, recent works explore the notion of closure certificates, a form of transition invariants, to verify dynamical systems against $\omega$-regular properties including safety. A closure certificate, defined over state pairs of a dynamical system, is a real-valued function whose zero superlevel set characterizes an inductive transition invariant of the system. The search for such a certificate can be effectively automated by assuming it to be within a specific template class, e.g. a polynomial of a fixed degree, and then using optimization techniques such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to find it. Unfortunately, one may not be able to find such a certificate for a fixed template. In such a case, one must change the template, e.g. increase the degree of the polynomial. In this paper, we consider a notion of multiple closure certificates dubbed interpolation-inspired closure certificates. An interpolation-inspired closure certificate consists of a set of functions which jointly over-approximate a transition invariant by first considering one-step transitions, then two, and so on until a transition invariant is obtained. The advantage of interpolation-inspired closure certificates is that they allow us to prove properties even when a single function for a fixed template cannot be found using standard approaches. We present SOS programming and a scenario program to find these sets of functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to verify persistence and general $\omega$-regular specifications in some case studies.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a Directional Modulation Testbed for Reconfigurable Transmitters for Spatially Agile MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the implementation and validation of a microwave testbed for directionally modulated transmission. Directional modulation enables multiple communication and/or radar signals to be transmitted in multiple directions simultaneously using a single phased array aperture, helping to relieve spectral congestion. A two-element transmitter array is driven by a Xilinx ZCU208 Radio Frequency System on a Chip (RFSoC). Our testbed provides a foundation for developing a fully reconfigurable array transmitter for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) radar and communications, which will incorporate in-situ measurement, reconfigurable matching circuitry, and fast tuning algorithms for frequency and directional selectivity. This testbed enables development and validation of reconfigurable techniques for adaptive spectral and spatial coexistence.</description>

      <title>Grid-ECO: Grid Aware Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Placement Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops a methodology, Grid-ECO, to optimally allocate electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) within a distribution feeder, while considering EV charging demand at census-level granularity. The underlying problem is NP-hard and requires satisfying nonlinear, nonconvex, three-phase unbalanced AC network constraints while including integer decision variables. Existing works cannot guarantee AC feasibility nor optimality of this problem without either i) relaxing the integer decision variable space or ii) convexifying AC constraints. Proposed Grid-ECO exactly solves the underlying mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) to near-zero optimality gap while prioritizing candidate locations based on grid voltage and current sensitivities. To solve the MINLP exactly, Grid-ECO exactly reformulates it into mixed-integer bilinear program (MIBLP), enabling global optimization using the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm (sBnB). To ensure computational tractability for large-scale feeders, we develop and include a novel presolving strategy based on Sequential Bound Tightening (SBT) with variable filtering and decomposition. Case studies demonstrate that Grid-ECO outperforms the off-the-shelf Gurobi sBnB solver by solving cases where no feasible solution is found within 167 hours. When feasible solution is found by off-the-shelf solver, Grid-ECO reduces solution time by up to 73\% and sBnB node exploration by up to 97\%, while achieving a 0\% optimality gap and guaranteed AC feasibility.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Network Prices for Prosumer-aware Hosting Capacity Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast uptake of distributed energy resources (DERs) presents increasing challenges for managing hosting capacity in distribution networks. Existing solutions include direct load control, operating envelopes, and price-based control through dynamic energy prices. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often rely on assumed prosumer behavioural patterns and overlook prosumers' desire to retain control over their devices. Additionally, current fixed or Time-of-Use (ToU) prices are based on spatial and temporal averages, having limited impact on network conditions and DER operation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a bilevel optimisation framework that explicitly models prosumer decision-making in the design of dynamic network prices. The upper level represents the distribution system operator (DSO), setting network prices under cost-recovery and network constraints, while the lower level models prosumers optimising DER operation in response. The proposed framework preserves customer prerogative, enhances DER flexibility, and offers actionable insights for network hosting capacity management and the evolution of network tariff structures under high DER penetration.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Guided Safety Filters: State-Dependent Hessian-Weighted Projection with Provable Performance Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters provide a lightweight mechanism for enforcing state and input safety in learning-enabled control. However, common Euclidean projections onto the safe set disregard long-term performance, while directly optimizing the action-value function within the safe set can be nonconvex and computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes a state-dependent, Hessian-guided projection for safety filtering that preserves convexity while improving performance. The key idea is to select a weighted projection matrix from the curvature of the action-value function, thereby biasing the correction toward action directions with higher value sensitivity. We establish (i) a uniform bound on the performance gap between the weighted projection and the safe value-optimal action, and (ii) a condition under which the weighted projection outperforms the Euclidean projection in long-term value. To support black-box controllers, we further present a data-driven construction of the weighted projection matrix via an iterative Q-function learning algorithm with quadratic feature blocks and regularization that enforces curvature dominance and bounded higher-order terms. Simulations on a quadrotor tracking-and-avoidance task indicate that the proposed filter maintains safety while reducing value degradation relative to Euclidean projection, with computational overhead compatible with real-time operation.</description>

      <title>When Environments Shift: Safe Planning with Generative Priors and Robust Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems operate in environments that may change over time. An example is the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles whose behavior may change based on factors such as traffic density, road visibility, and social norms. Therefore, the environment encountered during deployment rarely mirrors the environment and data encountered during training -- a phenomenon known as distribution shift -- which can undermine the safety of autonomous systems. Conformal prediction (CP) has recently been used along with data from the training environment to provide prediction regions that capture the behavior of the environment with a desired probability. When embedded within a model predictive controller (MPC), one can provide probabilistic safety guarantees, but only when the deployment and training environments coincide. Once a distribution shift occurs, these guarantees collapse. We propose a planning framework that is robust under distribution shifts by: (i) assuming that the underlying data distribution of the environment is parameterized by a nuisance parameter, i.e., an observable, interpretable quantity such as traffic density, (ii) training a conditional diffusion model that captures distribution shifts as a function of the nuisance parameter, (iii) observing the nuisance parameter online and generating cheap, synthetic data from the diffusion model for the observed nuisance parameter, and (iv) designing an MPC that embeds CP regions constructed from such synthetic data. Importantly, we account for discrepancies between the underlying data distribution and the diffusion model by using robust CP. Thus, the plans computed using robust CP enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees, in contrast with plans obtained from a single, static set of training data. We empirically demonstrate safety under diverse distribution shifts in the ORCA simulator.</description>

      <title>Safe Controller Synthesis Using Lyapunov-based Barriers for Linear Hybrid Systems with Simplex Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems often have a two-layered design, where the primary controller is AI-enabled or an analytical controller optimising some specific cost function. If the resulting control action is perceived as unsafe, a secondary safety-focused backup controller is activated. The existing backup controller design schemes do not consider a real-time deadline for the course correction of a potentially unsafe system trajectory or constrain maximisation of the safe operating region as a synthesis criterion. This essentially implies an eventual safety guarantee over a small operating region.
  This paper proposes a novel design method for backup safe controllers (BSCs) that ensure invariance across the largest possible region in the safe state space, along with a guarantee for timely recovery when the system states deviate from their usual behaviour. This is the first work to synthesise safe controllers that ensure maximal safety and timely recovery while aiming at minimal resource usage by switching between BSCs with different execution rates. An online safe controller activation policy is also proposed to switch between BSCs (and the primary optimal controller) to optimise processing bandwidth for control computation. To establish the efficacy of the proposed method, we evaluate the safety and recovery time of the proposed safe controllers, as well as the activation policy, in closed loops with linear hybrid dynamical systems under budgeted bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Dual-Channel Feature Fusion for Joint Prediction in Dynamic Signed Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is central to unraveling social network evolution and node relationships, as well as understanding the characteristic mechanisms of complex networks. Currently, research on link prediction for complex dynamic networks integrating temporal evolution, relational polarity and edge weight information remains significantly underexplored, failing to meet practical demands. For dynamic signed-weighted networks, this paper proposes a tripartite joint prediction framework for unified forecasting of links, signs and weights. First, the dynamic network is decomposed into temporal snapshots, and node semantic embeddings are generated via sign-aware weighted random walks. We then design multi-hop structural balance and temporal difference features to capture the structural characteristics and dynamic evolution laws of the network, respectively. The model adopts a dual-channel feature decoupling mechanism: node semantic embeddings are used for link existence prediction, while relational sign features are fed into a Transformer encoder to model temporal dependencies. Finally, prediction results are output synergistically through a multi-task unit. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves an average 2%-4% improvement in the performance of link existence and relational sign prediction, and a significant 40%-50% reduction in edge weight prediction error.</description>

      <title>From Data $H(j\omega_i)$ to Balanced Truncation Family: A Projection-based Non-intrusive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents data-driven implementations of balanced truncation and several of its generalizations that rely exclusively on transfer function samples on the imaginary axis. Rather than implicitly approximating the Gramians via numerical quadrature, the proposed approach approximates them implicitly through projection. This enables multiple members of the balanced truncation family to be implemented non-intrusively using practically measurable data, without requiring spectral factorizations. Using this projection-based framework, data-driven implementations are developed for standard balanced truncation, frequency-limited balanced truncation, time-limited balanced truncation, self-weighted balanced truncation, LQG balanced truncation, H-infinity balanced truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and stochastic balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed non-intrusive implementations achieve performance comparable to their intrusive counterparts and accurately capture the dominant Hankel singular values.</description>

      <title>Empirical Validation of a Dual-Defense Mechanism Reshaping Wholesale Electricity Price Dynamics in Singapore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ex-ante screening and static price caps are global standards for mitigating price volatility, Singapore's electricity market employs a unique dual-defense mechanism integrating vesting contracts (VC) with a temporary price cap (TPC). Using high-frequency data from 2021 to 2024, this paper evaluates this mechanism and yields three primary findings. First, a structural trade-off exists within the VC framework: while VC quantity (VCQ) suppresses average prices, it paradoxically exacerbates instability via liquidity squeezes. Conversely, VC price (VCP) functions as a tail-risk anchor, dominating at extreme quantiles where VCQ efficacy wanes. Second, a structural break around the 2023 reform reveals a fundamental re-mapping of price dynamics; the previously positive pass-through from offer ratios to clearing prices was largely neutralized post-reform. Furthermore, diagnostics near the TPC threshold show no systematic evidence of strategic bid shading, confirming the TPC's operational integrity. Third, the dual-defense mechanism exhibits a critical synergy that resolves the volatility trade-off. The TPC reverses the volatility penalty of high VCQ, shifting the elasticity of conditional volatility from a destabilizing 0.636 to a stabilizing -0.213. This synergy enables the framework to enhance tail-risk control while eliminating liquidity-related stability costs. We conclude that this dual-defense mechanism successfully decouples price suppression from liquidity risks, thereby maximizing market stability.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation and Attention for massive MIMO-based Indoor Localization in Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-precision indoor localization has grown significantly with the rise of smart environments, industrial automation, and location-aware applications. While massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems enable millimeter-level accuracy by leveraging rich Channel State Information (CSI), most existing solutions are optimized for static environments, where users or devices remain fixed during data collection and inference. Real-world applications, however, often require real-time localization in changing environments, where rapid movement, unpredictable blockages, and dynamic channel conditions pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce two data augmentation techniques designed to resemble blocked antennas, enhancing the generalizability of localization models to dynamic scenarios. Additionally, we enhance an existing Deep Learning (DL) model by incorporating attention modules, improving its ability to focus on relevant channel features and antennas. We train our model on data from a static scenario, augmented with the proposed techniques, and evaluate it on a dataset collected in changing scenarios. We investigate the performance enhancements achieved by the data augmentation techniques and the Attention modules, and observe a localization accuracy improvement from a mean error of 286 mm, when trained without Attention and without data augmentations, to 66 mm, when trained with Attention and data augmentation. This shows that high localization accuracy can be maintained in changing environments, even without training data from those scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Based Grid Point Allocation for LPV and Robust Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates systematic selection of optimal grid points for grid-based Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) and robust controller synthesis. In both settings, the objective is to identify a set of local models such that the controller synthesized for these local models will satisfy global stability and performance requirements for the entire system. Here, local models correspond to evaluations of the LPV or uncertain plant at fixed values of the scheduling signal or realizations of the uncertainty set, respectively. Then, Bayesian optimization is employed to discover the most informative points that govern the closed-loop performance of the designed LPV or robust controller for the complete system until no significant further performance increase or a user specified limit is reached. Furthermore, when local model evaluations are computationally demanding or difficult to obtain, the proposed method is capable to minimize the number of evaluations and adjust the overall computational cost to the available budget. Lastly, the capabilities of the proposed method in automatically obtaining a sufficiently informative grid set are demonstrated on three case-studies: a robust controller design for an unbalanced disk, a multi-objective robust attitude controller design for a satellite with uncertain parameters and two flexible rotating solar arrays, and an LPV controller design for a robotic arm.</description>

      <title>Encoder initialisation methods in the model augmentation setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear system identification (NL-SI) has proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models for highly complex systems. Recent encoder-based methods for artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have shown state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency, where the encoder is used to estimate the initial state allowing for batch optimisation methods. To address the lack of interpretability of these black-box ANN models, model augmentation approaches can be used. These combine prior available baseline models with the ANN learning components, resulting in faster convergence and more interpretable models. The combination of the encoder-based method with model augmentation has shown potential. Thus far, however, the encoder has still been treated as a black-box function in the overall estimation process, while additional information in the form of the baseline model is available to predict the model state from past input-output data. In this paper, we propose novel encoder initialisation approaches based on the available baseline model, resulting in improved noise robustness and faster convergence compared to black-box initialisation. The performance of these initialisation methods is demonstrated on a mass-spring-damper system.</description>

      <title>3-D Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: From Reflection to Transmission and From Single Hemisphere to Full 3-D Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are conventionally implemented as two-dimensional (2D) electromagnetic (EM) structures to steer incident waves toward desired reflection angles. This approach limits the reflection to a single hemisphere, and the beam-scanning range is relatively small. In this work, a novel three-dimensional (3D) RIS concept is proposed, where beam-scanning can be realized not only through reflection from the illuminated surface but also through controlled transmission toward adjacent surfaces, enabling near blind-spot-free coverage in the full 3D spatial domain. A cube-based 3D-RIS design operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies and consisting of six interconnected RIS surfaces is presented. Each surface integrates reconfigurable receiving and reflecting arrays with orthogonal polarizations to ensure intrinsic EM isolation, while a reconfigurable feeding network supports dynamic operation. A subarray-based synthesis approach with binary amplitude gating and predefined phase offsets is developed through a unified theoretical model. This model, validated through full-wave simulations, enables efficient beam switching through a shared aperture. Based on this framework, an 8 x 12 element surface comprising six 4 x 4 subarrays is designed, with each surface covering an angular range from -30 deg to +30 deg. The experimental prototype has been characterized in the 24 to 30 GHz band, and the results demonstrate a gain enhancement of 14.7 dB for reflection, while 14.1 dB is achieved for transmission to the neighboring surface. Finally, wireless communication trials using the Pluto software-defined radio platform combined with frequency up/down converters confirm improved constellation quality and a 6-7 dB improvement in error vector magnitude (EVM) for both reflection and neighboring surface transmission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamic N-1 Screening: Identifying High-Risk Lines and Transformers After Common Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power system operators routinely perform N-1 contingency analysis, yet conventional tools provide limited guidance on which lines or transformers deserve heightened attention during fast post-fault transients. In particular, static screening does not reveal whether (1) the same faulted line repeatedly triggers severe downstream overloads, or (2) a specific transformer emerges as vulnerable across many distinct fault scenarios. This paper introduces a real-time dynamic N-1 screening framework that addresses this gap by estimating, for each counterfactual single-phase transmission fault, the probability of transient overcurrent on critical grid elements. The output is an operator-facing dashboard that ranks (a) faulted lines whose outages most frequently lead to dangerous transformer overloads, and (b) transformers that consistently overload across top-risk scenarios, both of which are actionable indicators for real-time situational awareness. The approach models post-fault electromechanical dynamics using a linear stochastic formulation of the swing equations with short-lived, fault-localized uncertainty, and combines analytic transient evaluation with cross-entropy based importance sampling to efficiently estimate rare but high-impact events. All N-1 contingencies are evaluated in parallel with linear computational complexity. The framework is demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system, where it reveals latent high-risk lines and transformers that remain invisible under deterministic dynamic or static N-1 analysis. Results show orders-of-magnitude computational speedup relative to brute-force Monte Carlo, enabling practical deployment within real-time operational cycles.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions with Audio Risk Awareness for Robot Safe Navigation on Construction Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction automation increasingly requires autonomous mobile robots, yet robust autonomy remains challenging on construction sites. These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Lung nodule classification on CT scan patches using 3D convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer remains one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide. The likelihood of successful treatment depends strongly on the stage at which the disease is diagnosed. Therefore, early detection of lung cancer represents a critical medical challenge. However, this task poses significant difficulties for thoracic radiologists due to the large number of studies to review, the presence of multiple nodules within the lungs, and the small size of many nodules, which complicates visual assessment. Consequently, the development of automated systems that incorporate highly accurate and computationally efficient lung nodule detection and classification modules is essential. This study introduces three methodological improvements for lung nodule classification: (1) an advanced CT scan cropping strategy that focuses the model on the target nodule while reducing computational cost; (2) target filtering techniques for removing noisy labels; (3) novel augmentation methods to improve model robustness. The integration of these techniques enables the development of a robust classification subsystem within a comprehensive Clinical Decision Support System for lung cancer detection, capable of operating across diverse acquisition protocols, scanner types, and upstream models (segmentation or detection). The multiclass model achieved a Macro ROC AUC of 0.9176 and a Macro F1-score of 0.7658, while the binary model reached a Binary ROC AUC of 0.9383 and a Binary F1-score of 0.8668 on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. These results outperform several previously reported approaches and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for this task.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF: A Self-learning Framework for Persistent Surveillance using Cooperative Aerial Gliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of surveillance applications involving small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) depends on how long the limited on-board power would persist. To cope with this challenge, alternative renewable sources of lift are sought. One promising solution is to extract energy from rising masses of buoyant air. This paper proposes a local-global behavioral management and decision-making approach for the autonomous deployment of soaring-capable UAVs. The cooperative UAVs are modeled as non-deterministic finite state-based rational agents. In addition to a mission planning module for assigning tasks and issuing dynamic navigation waypoints for a new path planning scheme, in which the concepts of visibility and prediction are applied to avoid the collisions. Moreover, a delayed learning and tuning strategy is employed optimize the gains of the path tracking controller. Rigorous comparative analyses carried out with three benchmarking baselines and 15 evolutionary algorithms highlight the adequacy of the proposed approach for maintaining the surveillance persistency (staying aloft for longer periods without landing) and maximizing the detection of targets (two times better than non-cooperative and semi-cooperative approaches) with less power consumption (almost 6% of battery consumed in six hours).</description>

      <title>EARL: Energy-Aware Adaptive Antenna Control with Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) promises uniform high performance across the network, but also brings a high energy cost due to joint transmission from distributed radio units (RUs) and centralized processing in the cloud. Leveraging the resource-sharing capabilities of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), we propose EARL, an energy-aware adaptive antenna control framework based on reinforcement learning. EARL dynamically configures antenna elements in RUs to minimize radio, optical fronthaul, and cloud processing power consumption while meeting user spectral efficiency demands. Numerical results show power savings of up to 81% and 50% over full-on and heuristic baselines, respectively. The RL-based approach operates within 220 ms, satisfying O-RAN's near-real-time limit, and a greedy refinement further halves power consumption at a 2 s runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presented is an algorithm to synthesize the optimal infinite-horizon LQR feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of arbitrary input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along any trajectory. In addition to calculating the standard LQR gain matrix, a feedforward gain can be found to implement a reference tracking controller. This paper presents a theoretical justification for the method and shows several examples, including a validation test on a real scale aircraft.</description>

      <title>Composite Learning Backstepping Control With Provable Exponential Stability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive backstepping control provides a feasible solution to achieve asymptotic tracking for mismatched uncertain nonlinear systems. However, the closed-loop stability depends on high-gain feedback generated by nonlinear damping terms, and closed-loop exponential stability with parameter convergence involves a stringent condition named persistent excitation (PE). This paper proposes a composite learning backstepping control (CLBC) strategy based on modular backstepping and high-order tuners to compensate for the transient process of parameter estimation and achieve closed-loop exponential stability without the nonlinear damping terms and the PE condition. A novel composite learning mechanism is designed to maximize the staged exciting strength for parameter estimation, such that parameter convergence can be achieved under a condition of interval excitation (IE) or even partial IE that is strictly weaker than PE. An extra prediction error is employed in the adaptive law to ensure the transient performance without nonlinear damping terms. The exponential stability of the closed-loop system is proved rigorously under the partial IE or IE condition. Simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in both parameter estimation and control compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed to enable scalable implementations for constraint-based decision strategies, such as model predictive controllers. The bottom layer is based upon a distributed feedback-feedforward scheme that directs the controlled network's information flow according to a pre-specified communication infrastructure. Explicit expressions for the resulting closed-loop maps are obtained, and an offline model-matching procedure is proposed for designing the first layer. The obtained control laws are deployed via distributed state-space-based implementations, and the resulting closed-loop models enable predictive control design for the constraint management procedure described in our companion paper.</description>

Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both a reference governor for the bottom layer and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customisable implementations.</description>

  In this paper we
  aim to fill this gap, by exploring the possibility of evaluating some basic features, i.e., reachability and equilibria, and of solving two fundamental control problems, i.e., safe control and output regulation, for a BCN, leveraging only a limited amount of data
  generated by the network, without knowing or identifying its model.</description>

      <title>Solving Conic Programs over Sparse Graphs using a Variational Quantum Approach: The Case of the Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00341</link>

Abstract: Conic programs arise broadly in physics, quantum information, machine learning, and engineering, many of which are defined over sparse graphs. Although such problems can be solved in polynomial time using classical interior-point solvers, the computational complexity scales unfavorably with graph size. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving conic programs, including quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and semidefinite programs (SDPs). We encode primal variables via the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables via the probability mass function of a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. A primal-dual solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting the primal variables so that related observables are expressed in a banded form, enabling efficient measurement. The proposed framework is applied to the OPF problem, a large-scale optimization problem central to the operation of electric power systems. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an SIR Model with Noncompliance as a Social Contagion</title>

Abstract: We propose and study a compartmental model for epidemiology with human behavioral effects. Specifically, our model incorporates governmental prevention measures aimed at lowering the disease infection rate, but we split the population into those who comply with the measures and those who do not comply and therefore do not receive the reduction in infectivity. We then allow the attitude of noncompliance to spread as a social contagion parallel to the disease. We derive the reproductive ratio for our model and provide stability analysis for the disease-free equilibria. We then propose an optimal control scenario wherein a policy-maker with access to control variables representing disease prevention mandates, treatment efforts, and educational campaigns aimed at encouraging compliance minimizes a cost functional incorporating several cost concerns. Via careful analysis of the control-to-state map, we are able to prove existence of optimal controls. Our proof applies to dynamics which can be nonlinear in the control variables and general cost functionals including the case of $L^1$ control costs. We numerically resolve optimal strategies using the sequential quadratic Hamiltonian method, a relatively new numerical method for optimal control which is easy to implement and has good convergence theory, as we demonstrate. We test our model in several parameter regimes with specific interest in observing how the policy-maker's optimal strategies depend on their particular preferences which are expressed via design of different cost functionals.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Methods for Path Integral and Safe Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling-based approaches are widely used in systems without analytic models to estimate risk or find optimal control. However, gathering sufficient data in such scenarios can be prohibitively costly. On the other hand, in many situations, low-fidelity models or simulators are available from which samples can be obtained at low cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for risk quantification and path integral control that leverages such data from multiple models with heterogeneous sampling costs. A key technical novelty of our approach is the integration of Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) and Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) that enable data from different time and state representations (system models) to be jointly used to reduce variance and improve sampling efficiency. We also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method and show that our estimator is unbiased and consistent under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical simulation that the proposed method has improved computation (sampling costs) vs. accuracy trade-offs for risk quantification and path integral control.</description>

      <title>Risk-Based Capacity Accreditation of Resource-Colocated Large Loads in Capacity Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study capacity accreditation of resource-colocated large loads, defined as large demands such as data center and manufacturing loads colocated with behind-the-meter generation and storage resources, synchronously connected to the bulk power system, and capable of participating in the wholesale electricity market as an integrated unit. Because the accredited capacity of a resource portfolio is not equal to the sum of its individual resources' capacity values, we adopt a risk-based capacity accreditation framework to evaluate the combined reliability contribution of colocated resources. Grounded in the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) metric, the proposed capacity accreditation employs a convex optimization engine that jointly dispatches colocated resources to minimize reliability risk. We apply the developed methodology to a hydrogen manufacturing facility with colocated renewable generation, storage, and fuel cell resources.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control of PDEs on Domains with Graph-Monotone Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the extensive body of work on backstepping for one-dimensional PDEs, results in higher dimensions remain comparatively limited. Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models to provide a structured model of system evolution for control tasks. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage, offering a superior representation of uncertainty compared to using predictive models solely for forecasting system evolution. We integrate DST into Model Predictive Control (MPC) and evaluate it on energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees generated by more conventional models. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster, and simple Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>
