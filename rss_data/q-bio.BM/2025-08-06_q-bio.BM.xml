      <title>Decoding Polyphenol-Protein Interactions with Deep Learning: From Molecular Mechanisms to Food Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyphenols and proteins are essential biomolecules that influence food functionality and, by extension, human health. Their interactions -- hereafter referred to as PhPIs (polyphenol-protein interactions) -- affect key processes such as nutrient bioavailability, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic efficacy. However, these interactions remain challenging due to the structural diversity of polyphenols and the dynamic nature of protein binding. Traditional experimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), along with computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), have offered important insights but face constraints in scalability, throughput, and reproducibility. This review explores how deep learning (DL) is reshaping the study of PhPIs by enabling efficient prediction of binding sites, interaction affinities, and MD using high-dimensional bio- and chem-informatics data. While DL enhances prediction accuracy and reduces experimental redundancy, its effectiveness remains limited by data availability, quality, and representativeness, particularly in the context of natural products. We critically assess current DL frameworks for PhPIs analysis and outline future directions, including multimodal data integration, improved model generalizability, and development of domain-specific benchmark datasets. This synthesis offers guidance for researchers aiming to apply DL in unraveling structure-function relationships of polyphenols, accelerating discovery in nutritional science and therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Topological Learning Prediction of Virus-like Particle Stoichiometry and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the stoichiometry and associated stability of virus-like particles (VLPs) is crucial for optimizing their assembly efficiency and immunogenic properties, which are essential for advancing biotechnology, vaccine design, and drug delivery. However, current experimental methods for determining VLP stoichiometry are labor-intensive, and time consuming. Machine learning approaches have hardly been applied to the study of VLPs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel persistent Laplacian-based machine learning (PLML) mode that leverages both harmonic and non-harmonic spectra to capture intricate topological and geometric features of VLP structures. This approach achieves superior performance on the VLP200 dataset compared to existing methods. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we collected a new dataset, VLP706, containing 706 VLP samples with expanded stoichiometry diversity. Our PLML model maintains strong predictive accuracy on VLP706. Additionally, through random sequence perturbative mutation analysis, we found that 60-mers and 180-mers exhibit greater stability than 240-mers and 420-mers.</description>

      <title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.</description>
