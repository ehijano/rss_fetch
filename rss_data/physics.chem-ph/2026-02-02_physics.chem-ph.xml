      <title>A combined criterion of surface free energy and roughness to predict the wettability of non-ideal low-energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of wettability between solid and liquid substances in different fields encourages scientists to develop accurate models to estimate the resultant apparent contact angles. Surface free energy (SFE), which is principally defined for ideal (flat) surfaces, is not applicable to predict the wettability of real (rough) surfaces. This paper introduces a new parameter, namely normalized surface free energy (NSFE) as a combination of SFE and roughness, to predict the contact angle of liquids on non-ideal low-energy surfaces. The remarkable consistency of the predicted and measured contact angles of liquids on some rough surfaces also confirm the validity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description>

      <title>Resonant Coupling Between Electromagnetic Waves and Protein Conformational Dynamics Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biological effects of electromagnetic fields on proteins remain controversial beyond well-established thermal mechanisms, particularly with respect to frequency-dependent responses. Here, we propose that electromagnetic waves can modulate protein conformation through resonant coupling with intrinsic protein dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to characterize spontaneous conformational fluctuations in the absence of external fields, and a tiered screening strategy combined with fast Fourier transform analysis was used to identify dominant intrinsic frequencies associated with periodically fluctuating non-covalent atom or residue pairs. Oscillating external electric fields were subsequently applied at resonant and off-resonant frequencies to evaluate conformational responses across diverse protein systems. The results demonstrate that resonant excitation induces significantly enhanced backbone conformational deviations compared to off-resonant conditions, with the effect becoming more pronounced in structurally flexible and multichain proteins. These findings provide atomistic evidence for frequency-specific resonance between electromagnetic fields and protein conformational dynamics, offering mechanistic insight into frequency-dependent electromagnetic effects and a computational framework for electromagnetic wave-based modulation of protein function.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Domain Graph Learning Protocol for Single-Step Molecular Geometry Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate molecular geometries are a prerequisite for reliable quantum-chemical predictions, yet density functional theory (DFT) optimization remains a major bottleneck for high-throughput molecular screening. Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-\AA{} all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\% under loose and 33.4\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond Nonadiabatic Confinement of Molecular Dication Yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly charged molecular cations often carry signatures of electronic correlation and electron-nuclear entanglement present in the parent cation. Here, we produce ethylene dications using a combination of an extreme ultraviolet pump and near-infrared probe pulses, observing a peak in the dication yield at a pump-probe delay of approximately 15 fs. Ab-initio calculations, which explicitly take into account coupled electron-nuclear dynamics induced by the pump and the multiphoton nature of the probe-induced ionization step, reproduced the observed delay in the yield. It originates from resonant enhancement of the multiphoton ionization of the electronically excited ethylene cation as the carbon-carbon double bond expands. However, this effect is tempered by rapid nonadiabatic relaxation of the excited ionic states. Our results suggest a general mechanism whereby ultrafast nonadiabatic relaxation of a molecular ion can compete with its strong-field ionization rate, confining the dication yield to a narrow temporal window of a few femtoseconds.</description>

      <title>ThermoLIB -- A Python Library for Constructing and Post-Processing Free Energy Surfaces to Extract Thermodynamic and Kinetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ThermoLIB is Python/Cython library designed to be used as a post-processing tool for constructing free energy surfaces from the output of molecular simulations, transforming them between different collective variables (CVs) and extracting thermodynamic and kinetic information. ThermoLIB is available for download on GitHUB and comes with extended documentation as well as many tutorials. The implementation is based on the theory of maximum likelihood estimators and includes error bars on and full covariance matrix between all points on the free energy surface using the Fisher information matrix. The free energy surfaces can be transformed a posteriori to other collective variables, projected towards lower dimensional CV-spaces and even deprojected towards higher dimensional CV-spaces if additional information from the simulation is provided in the form of a conditional probability. Finally, one can extract usefull thermodynamic and kinetic properties such as the reaction free energy and kinetic rate constant. Error bars on the free energy surfaces are propagated throughout al these operations. We briefly illustrate the capabilities of ThermoLIB by means of some tutorials and case studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging configuration interaction singles for qualitative descriptions of ground and excited states: state-averaging, linear-response, and spin-projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While configuration interaction singles (CIS) provides a computationally efficient description of excited states, it systematically overestimates excitation energies and performs poorly for strongly correlated systems, partially due to the lack of orbital relaxation and the strong ground-state bias of Hartree-Fock orbitals. To address these limitations, we present a unified variational framework that extends CIS by incorporating orbital optimization (state-specific and state-averaged), linear-response orbital relaxation via double-CIS schemes, and spin-symmetry breaking and restoration. In spin-projected state-averaged formulations, standard multistate parametrizations are no longer valid because the projection operator breaks the unitary invariance of orbital rotations and induces nonorthogonal couplings among states. By formulating a rigorous state-averaged objective in the projected subspace, we derive analytic gradients and Hessians and enable robust optimization using a trust-region augmented Hessian algorithm. Benchmark calculations show that spin projection alone significantly exacerbates the CIS overestimation in weakly correlated systems, whereas combining spin projection with state averaging or double-CI corrections substantially reduces errors, particularly for Rydberg excitations. We further demonstrate that state averaging and spin projection provide complementary and essential benefits in strongly correlated regimes, as illustrated by the bond dissociation of hydrogen fluoride.</description>

      <title>The two-positron gluonic bond as a manifestation of "super" van der Waals interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been demonstrated theoretically that the interaction of two PsH atoms, each being a stable bound state of a hydrogen atom and a positronium atom, is attractive, leading to the formation of a molecular complex denoted as (PsH)2. However, the physical nature of this interaction has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations. Notably, the interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects. Accordingly, the bond formed between PsH units, termed here a two-positron gluonic bond to emphasize its fundamentally distinct character from the two-positron covalent bonds present in pure antimatter molecules, emerges only when matter and antimatter particles form a common bound state. When classified within the framework of known bonding mechanisms, this gluonic bond falls into the category of stabilizing dispersion interactions, giving rise to a van der Waals complex. However, its remarkably large bond dissociation energy, compared with those of strongly bonded van der Waals complexes of similar size, reveals an anomalously strong interaction. For this reason, we propose that (PsH)2 is most appropriately described as a "super" van der Waals complex stabilized by a "super" van der Waals bond.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Monolayer Ice on a Hydrophobic Metal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding water-metal interactions is central to disciplines spanning catalysis, electrochemistry, and atmospheric science. Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).</description>

      <title>Millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy of methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and somewhat larger cyano derivatives were detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 recently. Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \le 61$ and $K_a \le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>

      <title>QMeCha: quantum Monte Carlo package for fermions in embedding environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first open access version of the QMeCha (Quantum MeCha) code, a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) package developed to study many-body interactions between different types of quantum particles, with a modular and easy-to-expand structure. The present code has been built to solve the Hamiltonian of a system that can include nuclei and fermions of different mass and charge, e.g. electrons and positrons, embedded in an environment of classical charges and quantum Drude oscillators. To approximate the ground state of this many-particle operator, the code features different wavefunctions. For the fermionic particles, beyond the traditional Slater determinant, QMeCha also includes Geminal functions such as the Pfaffian, and presents different types of explicit correlation terms in the Jastrow factors. The classical point charges and quantum Drude oscillators, described through different variational ans\"atze, are used to model a molecular environment capable of explicitly describing dispersion, polarization, and electrostatic effects experienced by the nuclear and fermionic subsystem. To integrate these wavefunctions, efficient variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo protocols have been developed, together with a robust wavefunction optimization procedure that features correlated sampling.</description>

      <title>Optimized tandem catalyst patterning for CO$_2$ reduction flow reactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem catalysis involves two or more catalysts arranged in proximity within a single reaction vessel, with the aim of synergistically aligning the catalysts' reaction pathways to maximize overall system performance. This study presents a proof of concept showing the integration of continuum transport modeling with design optimization in a simplified two-dimensional flow reactor setup for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction. Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters, the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65$% compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design. For the optimized cases, observed differences in the production and consumption of CO (the key intermediate species) and minimized zones of low CO reactant surface concentration on Cu sections explain the improved reactor performance.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for User-friendly Chemical Process Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose spectral gap is quadratically larger than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the transition probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a Szegedy quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, and does not require further reversible computing methods. We also compare this construction with an alternative to Szegedy's approach which also provides a quadratic gap amplification. Since each step of the quantum walks uses a constant number of proposal and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum algorithms for excited-state quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic excited states are central to a vast array of physical and chemical phenomena, yet accurate and efficient methods for preparing them on quantum devices remain challenging and comparatively underexplored. We introduce a general dissipative algorithm for selectively preparing ab initio electronic excited states. The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these schemes through numerical simulations of atomic and molecular spectra, including valence excitations in prototypical planar conjugated molecules and transition-metal complexes. Taken together, these results provide a new pathway for advancing quantum simulation methods for realistic strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>
