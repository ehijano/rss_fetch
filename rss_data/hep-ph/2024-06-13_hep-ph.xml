      <title>Jet quenching in the glasma phase: medium-induced radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent considerations of parton momentum broadening in the glasma phase, we study the medium-induced soft gluon radiation of jet partons at early times in heavy-ion collisions. The glasma state is assumed to be comprised of independent color domains with homogenous longitudinal fields that vary event by event, and we further complete this model with an event-averaging procedure accounting for the finite correlation length. Using this description, we evaluate the rate of medium-induced radiation from an energetic parton at midrapidity in the glasma phase. We mainly focus on SU(2) color fields for simplicity, also referring to the U(1) case and comparing with the BDMPS-Z rate to gain further insight. Our results show that there is an intricate interplay of the synchrotron-like radiation in a single color domain with the destructive interference between different color domains, after the medium averaging is performed. Thus, we find that the emission rate is sensitive to the matter structure, decreasing for a glasma state populated by smaller color domains, i.e. for a glasma with a larger characteristic saturation scale. Our approach can be applied to more realistic backgrounds, and sets the stage for the modelling of jet evolution in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>Lighting up the Photon Wigner Distribution via Dilepton Productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\perp$, $b_\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small-$x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>A 17 MeV pseudoscalar and the LSND, MiniBooNE and ATOMKI anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of any new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), anomalous results at low energy experiments have become the subject of increased attention and scrutiny. We focus on three such results from the LSND, MiniBooNE (MB), and ATOMKI experiments. A 17 MeV pseudoscalar mediator ($a'$) can account for the excess events seen in $^8$Be and $^4$He pair creation transitions in ATOMKI. We incorporate this mediator in a gauge invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a second Higgs doublet and three singlet (seesaw) neutrinos ($N_i, i=1,2,3$). $N_{1,2}$ participate in an interaction in MB and LSND which, with $a'$ as mediator, leads to the production of $e^+ e^-$ pairs. The $N_i$ also lead to mass-squared differences for SM neutrinos in agreement with global oscillation data. We first show that such a model offers a clean and natural joint solution to the MB and LSND excesses. We then examine the possibility of a common solution to all three anomalies. Using the values of the couplings to the quarks and electrons which are required to explain pair creation nuclear transition data for $^8$Be and $^4$He in ATOMKI, we show that these values lead to excellent fits for MB and LSND data as well, allowing for a common solution. We obtain a representative solution space for this, in the context of an important constraint that comes from the decay $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ a' \, (a'\rightarrow e^+e^-$). We also discuss other constraints on the model from both collider and non-collider experiments as well as those from electroweak precision data, stability and unitarity. We compute the contributions to the electron and muon $g-2$ up to two loops for our model and discuss the results in the context of the current theoretical and empirical scenario vis a vis these parameters. Finally, we discuss future tests of the model in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for numerically stable scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerically stable evaluation of scattering matrix elements near the infrared limit of gauge theories is of great importance for the success of collider physics experiments. We present a novel algorithm that utilizes double precision arithmetic and reaches higher precision than a naive quadruple precision implementation at smaller computational cost. The method is based on physics-driven modifications to propagators, vertices and external polarizations.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations in associated top-quark and dark matter production at Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the processes of single top quark production in association with dark matter particles through the t-channel in simplified models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators. Within the framework of these models, we analyze the spin correlations that arise in the top quark production process in association with dark matter, comparing them with the production of a top quark in the Standard Model. We consider angular correlations of kinematic variables, which define admissible regions in momentum space and can be used experimentally to distinguish between the fraction of the total momentum carried away by the scalar or pseudoscalar mediator.</description>

      <title>Off-shell pion properties: electromagnetic form factors and light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The off-shell pion electromagnetic form factors are explored with corresponding off-shell light-front wave functions modeled by constituent quark and anti-quark. We apply the Mandelstam approach for the microscopic computation of the form factors relating the model parameters with the pion decay constant and charge radius. Analyzing the existing data on the cross-sections for the Sullivan process, $^1$H$(e,e',\pi^+)n$, we extract the off-shell pion form factor using the relation derived from the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity for the pion electromagnetic current. They are compared with our previous results from exactly solvable manifestly covariant model of a (3+1)-dimensional fermion field theory. We find that the adopted constituent quark model reproduces the extracted off-shell form factor $F_1(Q^2,t)$ from the experimental data within a few percent difference and matches well with our previous theoretical simulation which exhibits a variation of about 10 % for the extracted off-shell pion form factor g(Q^2,t). We also identify the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) and transverse momentum distribution (TMD) in terms of the light-front wave function and discuss their off-shell properties.</description>

      <title>Wideband tunable cavity development for axion dark matter searches using a piezoelectric motor in combination with gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detected axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.</description>

      <title>Review of the low-lying excited baryons $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong empirical and phenomenological indications exist for large sea-quark admixtures in the low-lying excited baryons. Investigating the low-lying excited baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ is important to determine the nature of the low-lying excited baryons. We review the experimental and theoretical progress on the studies of the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$. Although several candidates have received intensive discussions, such as $\Sigma(1620)$ and $\Sigma(1480)$, their existence needs further confirmation. Following the prediction of the unquenched quark models for the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$, many theoretical works suggested the existence of these states in various processes. Future experimental measurements could shed light on the existence of the low-lying excited $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ state.</description>

      <title>A quark core-gluon model for heavy hybrid baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides the ordinary hadrons, QCD allows the existence of states in which excitations of the gluonic field can play the role of valence particles, either alone in a glueball, or coupled to quarks in a hybrid. So, hybrid baryons, made of three quarks and a gluon, can a priori exist. Till now, there is no experimental evidence for such exotic hadrons but experimental efforts are being made to search for them at CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer. In this work, a hybrid baryon is considered as a two-body system composed of a color octet three-quark core and a gluon, interacting via a QCD-inspired interaction. A semirelativistic potential model is built in which the dominant interaction is a potential simulating the flux tube confinement, and the Casimir scaling is assumed to link interactions between triplet and octet color sources. This picture is similar to the quark-diquark description for baryons. It is chosen in order to take properly into account the helicity of the gluon. Only $cccg$ and $bbbg$ states are considered because the strong mass asymmetry between the quark core and the gluon is expected to favor the formation of the core. As the results for heavy hybrid baryons seem relevant, we consider this paper as a proof of concept which can be extended for the study of light hybrid baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to determine the effective potential using the multicritical-point principle (MPP) under the additional scalar field. The MPP is applied to the model in which a singlet dark fermion and a singlet real scalar field are added to the Standard Model (SM) to predict the dark fermion mass. As a result, the dark fermion mass is predicted to be about 866-937 GeV.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that in general the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Studying $\pi^+\pi^-$ photoproduction beyond Pomeron exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward photoproduction of $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs with invariant mass of the order of $m_\rho\sim 770$ MeV is traditionally understood to be produced via Pomeron exchange. Based on a detailed analysis of the CLAS photoproduction data, it is shown that the dynamics of two-pion photoproduction for $|t|\gtrsim 0.5$ GeV$^2$ cannot be explained by Pomeron exchange alone. This motivates the development of a new theoretical model of two-pion photoproduction which incorporates both two-pion and pion-nucleon resonant contributions. After fitting free parameters, the model provides an excellent description of the low moments of the angular distribution measured at CLAS, and enables an assessment of the relative contributions of particular production mechanisms and an interpretation of the various features of the data in terms of these mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction in general-purpose event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of three different general-purpose Monte Carlo event generators, Herwig, Pythia, and Sherpa, with respect to the simulation of photoproduction. We outline the default inputs, implementation differences and compare the results at different stages of the event generation. We find that, despite a similar starting point, the final cross sections do have some differences related to different non-perturbative inputs. We compare the simulations with experimental data for jet production in LEP and HERA and find that all generators provide a decent desription of the data within the considered uncertainties. We also present predictions for the upcoming EIC for jet observables and event shapes and conclude that accurate simulations will require further phenomenological advances.</description>

      <title>Constraining the axial-vector X17 interpretation with ${}^{12}$C data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings of an unexpected, narrow resonance in the $e^+e^-$ decay spectra of excited states of $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C by the ATOMKI collaboration have received considerable experimental and theoretical attention, whereby a new, 17-MeV vector-like or axial-vector-like boson termed X17 was conjectured as an explanation of the anomaly. Further analysis of all existing constraints disfavors a vector X17 scenario. For a similar analysis of the axial-vector scenario, a calculation of the reduced matrix element of a spin-dipole operator between the excited nuclear state ${}^{12}$C(17.23) and the carbon ground state is required. In the present work, we compute the aforementioned reduced matrix element under the assumption that the state ${}^{12}$C(17.23) is well represented by the $2s_{1/2}1p^{-1}_{3/2}$ particle-hole shell-model excitation of the ground state, as supported by experimental data. Within such a framework, our results indicate that, like the vector scenario, the axial-vector interpretation of X17 shows strong tensions with the other existing constraints on the nucleon coupling of a conjectured X17.</description>

      <title>Double pion photoproduction off nucleons in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double pion photoproduction off nucleons near threshold is analyzed in a covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory up to next to leading order, where the $\Delta(1232)$, $N^*(1400)$ and $\rho(770)$ resonances are included as explicit degrees of freedom. For the process $\gamma p \to \pi^+ \pi^0 n$, the chiral results of total cross sections, invariant-mass distributions and beam-helicity asymmetry are in good agreement with the experimental data within uncertainties. For the process $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$, the prediction of total cross section deviates from the existing experimental data. Once the final-state interaction of $\pi \pi$ in the isoscalar S-wave channel is taken into account, a good description of the cross section is achieved. The effect of the Roper resonance always turns out be negligible, and hence can be thrown away in future study of this process.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the form factors of $B_c\rightarrow\eta_c$, $J/\psi$ and corresponding weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The form factors of $B_c$ meson decaying to charmonium $\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$ are analyzed in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In these analyses, the contributions of the vacuum condensate terms $\langle g_{s}^{2}G^{2}\rangle$ and $\langle f^{3}G^{3}\rangle$ are considered. In addition, the decay widths and branch ratios of several decay channels are obtained by using the calculated form factors. These decay processes include the nonleptonic decay processes of $B_c^- \to \eta_c \pi^-$, $\eta_c K^-$, $\eta_c \rho^-$, $\eta_c K^{*-}$, $B_c^- \to J/\psi \pi^-$, $J/\psi K^-$, $J/\psi \rho^-$, $J/\psi K^{*-}$, and the semileptonic decay channels of $B_c^- \to \eta_c \mathcal{l} \bar{\nu}$, $B_c^- \to J/\psi \mathcal{l} \bar{\nu}$. These results about the form factors and decay properties of $B_c$ meson provide useful information to us to study the heavy-quark dynamics and find new physics(NP) beyond Standard Model(SM).</description>

      <title>Heavy-to-light form factors to three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^3)$ to form factors with one massive and one massless quark coupling to an external vector, axialvector, scalar, pseudoscalar, or tensor current. We obtain analytic results for the color-planar contributions, for the contributions of light-quark loops, and the contributions with two heavy-quark loops. For the computation of the remaining master integrals we use the "expand and match" approach which leads to semi-analytic results for the form factors. We implement our results in a {\tt Mathematica} and a {\tt Fortran} code which allows for fast and precise numerical evaluations in the physically relevant phase space. The form factors are used to compute the hard matching coefficients in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory for all currents. The tensor coefficients at light-like momentum transfer are used to extract the hard function in $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ to three loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high $Q^2$ (photon virtuality) limit of single-inclusive hadron production in DIS (SIDIS) at small $x$, using the color glass condensate formalism at next-to-leading order. We focus on the $\Lambda_{QCD}^2 \ll \mathbf{p}_h^2 \ll Q^2$ kinematic regime where $\mathbf{p}_h$ is the produced hadron transverse momentum, and extract the Sudakov double logarithms. We further argue that compatibility between the CGC calculation and TMD factorization at one-loop order can only be achieved if the small-x evolution is kinematically constrained.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent findings of $Z_{cs}$ and $P_{cs}$ states, we investigate the strong interactions of the systems with open strangeness(es) from the light sector to the heavy sector (no beauty quark), where the interaction potential is derived from the vector meson exchange mechanism in $t$- and $u$-channels. In the current work, we discuss all of single channel cases for the open strangeness in the systemic framework, where the resonances $X_0(2866)$, $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are dynamically generated. Furthermore, there are many new exotics predicted. In addition, the left-hand cut problem in $t$- and $u$-channels is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Charged pion condensation and color superconductivity phenomena in chirally asymmetric dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the question of the influence of color superconductivity (CSC) on the formation of a phase with condensation of charged pions in dense chirally asymmetric quark matter is studied. We consider it within the framework of the massless NJL model with a diquark interaction channel at zero temperature, but in the presence of baryon $\mu_B$, isospin $\mu_I$, chiral $\mu_{5}$ and chiral isospin $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials. It has been shown in the mean-field approximation that in the presence of chiral imbalance, when $\mu_{5}\ne 0$ and/or $\mu_{I5}\ne 0$, CSC phenomenon does not hinder the generation of charged pion condensation in dense quark matter even at largest baryon densities attainable in heavy ion collisions experiments and in cores of neutron stars and its mergers. So charged pion condensation in dense quark matter with chiral imbalance predicted earlier is not in a bit suppressed by the presence of CSC, highlighting the resilience of this phase in dense quark matter. This makes phase structure of dense quark matter even more rich, multifaceted and interesting, and shows that pion condensation in dense quark matter is viable phenomenon to be explored, for example, in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Only four $\mathbb{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_K$ orbifold building blocks are admissible in heterotic string compactifications. We investigate the flavor properties of all of these building blocks. In each case, we identify the traditional and modular flavor symmetries, and determine the corresponding representations and (fractional) modular weights of the available massless matter states. The resulting finite flavor symmetries include Abelian and non-Abelian traditional symmetries, discrete $R$ symmetries, as well as the double-covered finite modular groups $(S_3\times S_3)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_4$, $T'$, $2D_3$ and $S_3\times T'$. Our findings provide restrictions for bottom-up model building with consistent ultraviolet embeddings.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric trinification models with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(3)_C\times \mathrm{U}(3)_L \times \mathrm{U}(3)_R$ in Type IIA string theory on $\mathbf{T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)}$ orientifold with intersecting D6-branes. The non-trivial K-theory conditions and tadpole cancellation conditions severely restrict the number of allowed models even for the case of rectangular two-tori. Using a supervised search algorithm, we find a few four-family models where the highest wrapping number is 2. For these models, we present the complete particle spectra and the gauge coupling relations at the string-scale.</description>

      <title>String loops and gravitational positivity bounds: imprint of light particles at high energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study loop corrections to positivity bounds on effective field theories in the context of $2\to 2$ scattering in gravitational theories, in the presence of light particles. It has been observed that certain negative contributions at low energies are enhanced by inverse powers of a small mass $m$ and are nontrivial to cancel against other low-energy contributions. These originate from near the forward limit of diagrams involving graviton exchange. We observe that scattering in this kinematics domain remains infrared-sensitive even at high center-of-mass energy. By considering a string-inspired model in which high-energy loops can be calculated using unitarity and Regge behavior of tree amplitudes, we uncover a natural mechanism through which $1/m$-enhanced terms perfectly cancel between low and high energy contributions. This concretely explains possible positivity violations in the presence of gravity from the high-energy viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalars in de Sitter space, computed in standard perturbation theory, are hindered by time-dependent infrared divergences in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing the expansion of space. It has often been pointed out that loop corrections to these correlation functions make their divergence even stronger. In this note, we argue that this is not the case: Loop corrections can be treated systematically with standard perturbative techniques (such as dimensional regularization) without necessarily introducing new $\ln a(t)$ dependencies. To be concrete, we focus on correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this case, divergences from loops can be removed systematically with counterterms order by order, and one finds that observable loop-corrected correlation functions are indistinguishable from their tree-level form. By adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we further point out that our results favor the use of physical cutoffs (as opposed to comoving cutoffs) to regularize infrared divergences in general diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops and vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the chiral separation effect (CSE) in QCD by using the gauge/gravity duality. In QCD, this effect arises from a combination of chiral anomalies and the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Due to the axial gluon anomaly, the value of the CSE conductivity is not determined by the anomalies of QCD but receives radiative corrections, which leads to nontrivial dependence on temperature and density. To analyze this dependence, we use different variants of V-QCD, a complex holographic model, carefully fitted to QCD data. We find our results for the anomalous CSE conductivity at small chemical potential and nonzero temperature to be in good qualitative agreement with recent results from lattice QCD simulations. We furthermore give predictions for the behavior of the conductivity at finite (vectorial and axial) chemical potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of three nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.</description>

      <title>Dark matter capture in celestial objects: Improved treatment of multiple scattering and updated constraints from white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.04204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit dark matter (DM) capture in celestial objects, including the impact of multiple scattering, and obtain updated constraints on the DM-proton cross section using observations of white dwarfs. Considering a general form for the energy loss distribution in each scattering, we derive an exact formula for the capture probability through multiple scatterings. We estimate the maximum number of scatterings that $can$ take place, in contrast to the number $required$ to bring a dark matter particle to rest. We employ these results to compute a "dark" luminosity $L_{\rm DM}$, arising solely from the thermalized annihilation products of the captured dark matter. Demanding that $L_{\rm DM}$ not exceed the luminosity of the white dwarfs in the M4 globular cluster, we set a bound on the DM-proton cross section: $\sigma_{p} \lesssim 10^{-44} {\rm cm}^2$, almost independent of the dark matter mass between 100 GeV and 1 PeV and mildly weakening beyond. This is a stronger constraint than those obtained by direct detection experiments in both large mass $\left(M \gtrsim 5 \,\,\rm TeV\right)$ and small mass $\left(M \lesssim 10\,\, \rm GeV\right)$ regimes. For dark matter lighter than 350 MeV, which is beyond the sensitivity of present direct detection experiments, this is the strongest available constraint.</description>

      <title>Majorana Phase And Matter Effects In Neutrino Chiral Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to finite masses and mixing, for neutrinos propagation in space-time, there is a chiral oscillation between left- and right- chiral neutrinos, besides the usual oscillation between different generations. The probability of chiral oscillation is suppressed by a factor of $m^2/E^2$ making the effect small for relativistic neutrinos. However, for non-relativistic neutrinos, this effect can be significant. In matter, the equation of motion is modified. When neutrinos produced in weak interaction pass through the matter, the eigen-energies are split into two different ones depending on the helicity of the neutrino. This results in different oscillation behavior for neutrinos with different helicity, in particular there is a new resonant effect related to the helicity state of neutrino different than the usual MSW effect. For Majorana neutrinos, chiral oscillation also depends on Majorana phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the striking similarity between the cosmic abundances of baryons and dark matter, despite their very different astrophysical behavior, strongly motivates the scenario in which dark matter resides within a rich dark sector parallel in structure to that of the standard model. The near cosmic coincidence is then explained by an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry between the two sectors, where dark matter consists of stable dark neutrons, with matter and dark matter asymmetries arising via parallel WIMP baryogenesis mechanisms. Taking a top-down perspective, we point out that an adequate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry necessitates solving the electroweak hierarchy problem in each sector, without our committing to a specific implementation. A higher-dimensional realization in the far UV is presented, in which the hierarchical couplings of the two sectors and the requisite $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking structure arise naturally from extra-dimensional localization and gauge symmetries. We trace the cosmic history, paying attention to potential pitfalls not fully considered in previous literature. Residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking can very plausibly give rise to the asymmetric reheating of the two sectors, needed to keep the cosmological abundance of relativistic dark particles below tight bounds. We show that, despite the need to keep inter-sector couplings highly suppressed after asymmetric reheating, there can naturally be order-one couplings mediated by TeV scale particles which can allow experimental probes of the dark sector at high energy colliders. Massive mediators can also induce dark matter direct detection signals, but likely at or below the neutrino floor.</description>

      <title>Electric Dipole Moments in 5+3 Flavor Weak Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fully generic treatment of electric dipole moments (EDMs) is presented in the CP-violating and flavor-conserving weak effective field theory (WET) with five flavors of quarks and three flavors of leptons. We systematically analyze leading contributions to EDMs originating from QCD and QED renormalization group running between the electroweak scale and low energy scales of about 2 GeV. We include the full one-loop anomalous dimension and a subset of two-loop corrections, as well as threshold corrections at the bottom, charm and $\tau$ masses. This allows us to derive master formulae in the space of generic WET for the neutron and proton EDMs, for EDMs of diamagnetic atoms, and the precession frequencies constrained in molecular EDM experiments, from which bounds on the electron EDM are extracted. In particular, our master formulae capture the contributions of WET CP-violating operators with heavy quark and lepton flavors. As an application, we study EDM constraints on the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson, in both the linear and non-linear realizations of electroweak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that unlike the SM in the flavor spin theories (theories with non- Euclidean/pseudo-unitary signature of the kinematic quadratic term of the Lagrangian) the Yukawa mass matrices are not arbitrary. This restricts the possible textures of both lepton and quark flavor mixing matrices to the experimentally observed form and reduces the number of real mixing parameters by two. In addition, some pairs of elements of V_CKM and separately U_PMNS are forced to have the same absolute values, which is experimentally confirmed within the error bounds. Apart from the flavor mixing the change in the signature imprints no changes in the SM.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated two distinct models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in scattering processes of $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$. We verified that employing the model with dual electromagnetic tensor $(\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu})$ led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. Conversely, utilizing the model with nonminimal coupling with $(F_{\mu\nu})$ preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. Consequently, this could hold promising implications, considering that the nonminimal coupling model with dual electromagnetic tensor $\tilde {F}_{\mu\nu}$ appeared potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we anticipate that these findings might offer a valuable roadmap for further exploration into the investigation of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with phenomenological implications that are certainly not trivial.</description>

Abstract: We study the contribution of Scalar Leptoquark (SLQ) loops to the two photon scattering cross section at high energies. The leading order helicity amplitudes are discussed at coupling O(e4) for Standard Model (SM) fermions, weak bosons and SLQs. Helicity amplitudes for the different types of loops are calculated for photon center of mass energies being much higher than weak boson mass scale but still much lower than the predicted Leptoquark mass scales. Finally, the cross section due to the SLQ loops is presented in conjunction with the known SM contribution.</description>

      <title>The magic of entangled top quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This raises the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>

      <title>Sliding Dumbbell Method to search for the CME in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CME, observed as back-to-back charge separation along the magnetic field axis, is investigated using the newly developed Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) applied to Au+Au events at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}_{\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV generated by the AMPT model with string melting configuration. The CME-like signal is externally injected in events by flipping charges of pairs of the particles perpendicular to the reaction plane. The study reports a significant enhancement of the CME-sensitive 3-particle $\gamma$ correlator in events with high back-to-back charge separation, in a given collision centrality. Additionally, a linear relationship is observed between the $\sqrt{|\gamma|}$ correlator for same-sign charge pairs and positive charge asymmetry ($\langle A{^+}\rangle$) across the dumbbell in CME-enriched sub-samples. Furthermore, the fraction of CME in $\Delta\gamma$ (difference between opposite and same sign $\gamma$ correlators) is presented across different collision centralities having different percentages of externally injected CME-like signal. Overall, the research aims to understand and detect the Chiral Magnetic Effect through innovative experimental method and detailed analysis of event structure.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the response of a Storage Ring Gravitational-Wave Observatory (SRGO) to astrophysical millihertz (mHz) gravitational waves (GWs), numerically obtaining its sensitivity curve and optimal choices for some controllable experiment parameters. We also generate synthetic noisy GW data and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to perform parameter estimation of the source properties and their degeneracies. We show that a single SRGO could potentially localize the GW source in the sky using Earth's rotation. We also study the source sky localization area, mass and distance estimation errors as functions of noise, data sampling rate, and observing time. Finally, we discuss, along with its implications, the capacity of an SRGO to detect and constrain the parameters of millihertz GW events.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent measures of correlations between mean transverse momentum and harmonic flow in heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow coefficients is an observable which is of great interest; it is sensitive to shape fluctuations in the initial state of a relativistic nuclear collision. The measurement of that correlation coefficient in central collisions allows one to infer about the intrinsic deformation of the colliding nuclei. We propose to study the momentum dependent covariance and correlation coefficient between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow in a given transverse momentum bin. Two possible constructions of such observables are provided and predictions are obtained from a viscous hydrodynamic model. We find that such momentum dependent correlation coefficients between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow show a strong and nontrivial momentum dependence. We also explore the effects of granularity (nucleon width) in the initial state, the nuclear deformation, and the shear viscosity on this momentum dependent correlation coefficient. The shape of the momentum dependence of the correlation coefficient for the triangular flow is found to be sensitive to the size of small scale fluctuations in the initial state. On the other hand, the shape of the momentum dependence of the covariance between the mean transverse momentum and the harmonic flow coefficients is found to be sensitive to the value of the shear viscosity and to the granularity of the initial state.</description>

      <title>Feature Learning and Generalization in Deep Networks with Orthogonal Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully-connected deep neural networks with weights initialized from independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network. However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth, to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that, at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$, rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations. We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed in deep networks with depth comparable to width. We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Extreme Axions Unveiled: a Novel Fluid Approach for Cosmological Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that solve some of the problems in the clustering of large scale structure in cosmology. ALPs are often described by a simplified quadratic potential to specify the dynamics of the axion field, and are included in cosmological analysis codes using a modified fluid prescription. In this paper we consider the extreme axion: a version of the axion with a high initial field angle that produces an enhancement (rather than a suppression) of structure on small scales around the Jeans length, which can be probed by measurements of clustering such as the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We present a novel method of modeling the extreme axion as a cosmological fluid, combining the Generalized Dark Matter model with the effective fluid approach presented in the \texttt{axionCAMB} software, as well as implementing a series of computational innovations to efficiently simulate the extreme axions. We find that for axion masses between $10^{-23} \mathrm{\ eV} \lesssim m_\mathrm{ax} \lesssim 10^{-22.5} \mathrm{\ eV}$, constraints on the axion fraction imposed by the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest can be significantly weakened by allowing them to be in the form of extreme axions with a starting angle between $\pi - 10^{-1} \lesssim \theta_i \lesssim \pi - 10^{-2}$. This work motivates and enables a more robust hydrodynamical analysis of extreme axions in order to compare them to high-resolution Ly-$\alpha$ forest data in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiativegravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for cosmic ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of this association to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, considering cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, including energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Asymptotic Behavior of S-matrix Elements from their Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic kinematic limits of S-matrices are dominated by large logarithms which, roughly speaking, fall into two categories: those which are controlled by a renormalization group (RG) scale, which we may think of as logs involving ratios of invariant mass scales, and those which are functions of ratios of rapidities, so called "rapidity logs". It has been pointed out by Caron-Huot and Wilhlem [1] that RG anomalous dimension can be extracted from the phase of the S-matrix, which can greatly simplify calculations via unitarity methods. In this paper we generalize the results of [1] to show that the phase can be used to reconstruct rapidity anomalous dimensions, by performing a complex boost. The methodology introduced here also allows one to calculate without the need for a rapidity regulator. We demonstrate the use of this method to derive the rapidity anomalous dimensions in the Sudakov form factor, the two parton soft function and the Regge trajectory in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the high-redshift universe have uncovered a significant number of active galactic nuclei, implying that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) would have to have been formed at much earlier times than expected. Direct collapse of metal-free gas clouds to SMBHs after recombination could help explain the early formation of SMBHs, but this scenario is stymied by the fragmentation of the clouds due to efficient molecular hydrogen cooling. We show that a subdominant population of tiny, evaporating primordial black holes, with significant clustering in some gas clouds, can heat the gas sufficiently so that molecular hydrogen is not formed, and direct collapse to to black holes is possible even at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of IR divergences and holography in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a renormalisation procedure for IR divergences of tree-level in-in late-time de Sitter correlators. These divergences are due to the infinite volume of spacetime and are analogous to the divergences that appear in AdS dealt with by holographic renormalisation. Regulating the theory using dimensional regularisation, we show that one can remove all infinities by adding local counterterms at the future boundary of dS in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral. The counterterms amount to renormalising the late-time bulk field. We frame the discussion in terms of bulk scalar fields in dS, using tree-level correlators of massless and conformal scalars for illustration. The relation to AdS via analytic continuation is discussed, and we show that different versions of the analytic continuation appearing in the literature are equivalent to each other. In AdS, one needs to add counterterms that are related to conformal anomalies, and also to renormalise the source part of the bulk field. The analytic continuation to dS projects out the traditional AdS counterterms, and links the renormalisation of the sources to the renormalisation of the late-time bulk field. We use these results to establish holographic formulae that relate tree-level dS in-in correlators to CFT correlators at up to four points, and we provide two proofs: one using the connection between the dS wavefunction and the partition function of the dual CFT, and a second by direct evaluation of the in-in correlators using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. The renormalisation of the bulk IR divergences is mapped by these formulae to UV renormalisation of the dual CFT via local counterterms, providing structural support for a possible duality. We also recast the regulated holographic formulae in terms of the AdS amplitudes of shadow fields, but show that this relation breaks down when renormalisation is required.</description>

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the theoretical and experimental progress in the investigation of novel high-temperature quantum chromodynamics phenomena in small systems at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. We highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with studying small systems, by which we generally mean collision systems that involve at least one light ion or even a photon projectile. We discuss perspectives on possible future research directions to better understand the underlying physics at work in the collisions of small systems.</description>

      <title>A proposal to improve the accuracy of cosmological observables and address the Hubble tension problem</title>

Abstract: (abridged)Cosmological observational programs often compare their data not only with $\Lambda$CDM, but also with extensions applying dynamical models of dark energy (DDE), with a time-dependent equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$. We found a degeneracy in the customary computational procedure for the expansion history, once DDE models are applied. This degeneracy provides an infinite number of cosmological models reproducing the Planck-measured CMB spectrum. Moreover, this degeneracy biases the comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with DDE extensions. We present a complementary computational approach, which breaks this degeneracy: the ``fixed early densities (EDs) approach'' evolves cosmological models from the early Universe to the present, in contrast to the customary ``fixed $H_0$ approach'' which evolves cosmological models in reverse order. We find the EDs are accurately approximated by the $\Lambda$CDM model. We implement a refined procedure, appyling both approaches, in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on representative DDE models using the CPL parametrization. Our results reveal that the CPL model $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find that combining both approaches, while requesting to yield consistent results and being in agreement with observations across cosmic time, can serve as a kind of consistency check for cosmological models. Moreover, our proposed consistency check applied within current data analysis methods will increase the accuracy of inferred cosmological parameters significantly, in particular for $\Lambda$CDM extensions. We find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of cosmological models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates and a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, by ongoing and future observational programs.</description>

      <title>Finite density QCD equation of state: critical point and lattice-based $T'$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel construction of the QCD equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon density. Our work combines a recently proposed resummation scheme for lattice QCD results with the universal critical behavior at the QCD critical point. This allows us to obtain a family of equations of state in the range $0 \leq \mu_B \leq 700$ MeV and 25 MeV $\leq T \leq 800$ MeV, which match lattice QCD results near $\mu_B=0$ while featuring a critical point in the 3D Ising model universality class. The position of the critical point can be chosen within the range accessible to beam-energy scan heavy-ion collision experiments. The strength of the singularity and the shape of the critical region are parameterized using a standard parameter set. We impose stability and causality constraints and discuss the available ranges of critical point parameter choices, finding that they extend beyond earlier parametric QCD EoS proposals. We present thermodynamic observables, including baryon density, pressure, entropy density, energy density, baryon susceptibility and speed of sound, that cover a wide range in the QCD phase diagram relevant for experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the presence of $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and $\omega(782)$ in $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ at Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of a partial-wave analysis of $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ using data from the Belle experiment at the KEKB $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collider. We validate our model with a model-independent analysis. We see the $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and a G-parity-violating $1^-[\omega(782)\pi]_\mathrm{P}$ wave in tauon decays. Our results will improve models used in simulation studies necessary for measuring the electric and magnetic dipole moments and Michel parameters of the $\tau$.</description>
