      <title>Failures of Compositionality: A Short Note on Cohomology, Sheafification and Lavish Presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many sciences one often builds large systems out of smaller constituent parts. Mathematically, to study these systems, one can attach data to the component pieces via a functor F. This is of great practical use if F admits a compositional structure which is compatible with that of the system under study (i.e. if the local data defined on the pieces can be combined into global data). However, sometimes this does not occur. Thus one can ask: (1) Does F fail to be compositional? (2) If so, can this failure be quantified? and (3) Are there general tools to fix failures of compositionality? The kind of compositionality we study in this paper is one in which one never fails to combine local data into global data. This is formalized via the understudied notion of what we call a lavish presheaf: one that satisfies the existence requirement of the sheaf condition, but not uniqueness. Adapting \v{C}ech cohomology to presheaves, we show that a presheaf has trivial zeroth presheaf-\v{C}ech cohomology if and only if it is lavish. In this light, cohomology is a measure of the failure of compositionality. The key contribution of this paper is to show that, in some instances, cohomology can itself display compositional structure. Formally, we show that, given any Abelian presheaf F : C^op --&gt; A and any Grothendieck pretopology J, if F is flasque and separated, then the zeroth cohomology functor H^0(-,F) : C^op --&gt; A is lavish. This follows from observation that, for separated presheaves, H^0(-,F) can be written as a cokernel of the unit of the adjunction given by sheafification. This last fact is of independent interest since it shows that cohomology is a measure of ``distance'' between separated presheaves and their closest sheaves (their sheafifications). On the other hand, the fact that H^0(-,F) is a lavish presheaf has unexpected algorithmic consequences.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>

      <title>Constructing Noncatenary Quasi-Excellent Precompletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a local (Noetherian) ring and let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be prime ideals of $T$. We find sufficient conditions for there to exist a quasi-excellent local subring $B$ of $T$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) the completion of $B$ at its maximal ideal is isomorphic to the completion of $T$ at its maximal ideal, (2) $B \cap Q_1 = B \cap Q_2$, (3) the set of prime ideals of $T/(Q_1 \cap Q_2)$ of positive height is the same as the set of prime ideals of $B/(B \cap Q_1)$ of positive height when viewed as partially ordered sets, and (4) for $i = 1$ and for $i = 2$, there is a coheight preserving bijection between the minimal prime ideals of $T_{Q_i}$ and the minimal prime ideals of $B_{B \cap Q_1}$. Intuitively, this means that $T$ contains a quasi-excellent local subring in which $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are "glued together" and such that both the completion and desirable properties of the prime spectrum are preserved. We use this result to show that certain complete local rings are the completion of a quasi-excellent local ring whose prime spectrum, when viewed as a partially ordered set, contains interesting noncatenary finite subsets.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Unimodality, and Lefschetz Properties for Graded Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Weak Lefschetz Properties for modules whose minimal free resolutions are given by generalized Kosuzl complexes in dimension three through a careful study of their Betti numbers and the symmetry and unimodality of their Hilbert functions. We also study the non-Lefschetz locus for finite length modules in arbitrary dimension, and are able to generalize several previous results on the non-Lefschetz locus in this setting. Along the way, we find several connections with a Gorenstein analogue for finite length modules and Artin level modules that are both interesting and useful throughout this paper.</description>

      <title>The miniversal deformation of certain complete intersection monomial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an explicit basis of the miniversal deformation of a monomial curve defined by a free semigroup -- these curves make up a notable family of complete intersection monomial curves. First, we dispense a general decomposition result of a basis of the miniversal deformation of any complete intersection monomial curve. As a consequence, we explicitly calculate this basis in the particular case of a monomial curve defined from a free semigroup. This explicit computation yields some estimates for the dimension of the moduli space of these family of curves.</description>
