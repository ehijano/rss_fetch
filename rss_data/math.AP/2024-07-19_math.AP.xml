      <title>Large-Time Behavior of Solutions to Compressible Navier-Stokes System in Unbounded Domains with Degenerate Heat-Conductivity and Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the large-time behavior of solutions to the initial and initial boundary value problems with large initial data for the compressible Navier-Stokes system with degenerate heat-conductivity describing the one-dimensional motion of a viscous heat-conducting perfect polytropic gas in unbounded domains. Both the specific volume and temperature are proved to be bounded from below and above independently of both time and space. Moreover, it is shown that the global solution is asymptotically stable as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Regularized 13-Moment Equations with Onsager Boundary Conditions in the Linear Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the time-dependent regularized 13-moment equations for general elastic collision models under the linear regime. Detailed derivation shows the proposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the moment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager boundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of undesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows is conducted to verified our model.</description>

      <title>Isolated steady solutions of the 3D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exist closed three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds where the incompressible Euler equations exhibit smooth steady solutions that are isolated in the $C^1$-topology. The proof of this fact combines ideas from dynamical systems, which appear naturally because these isolated states have strongly chaotic dynamics, with techniques from spectral geometry and contact topology, which can be effectively used to analyze the steady Euler equations on carefully chosen Riemannian manifolds. Interestingly, much of this strategy carries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker result that there exist analytic steady solutions on $\mathbf{T}^3$ such that the only analytic steady Euler flows in a $C^1$-neighborhood must belong to a certain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any $C^k$-neighborhood of a shear flow there are infinitely many linearly independent analytic shears.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain improved Strichartz estimates for solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation on compact manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvatures which are related to the classical universal results of Burq, G\'erard and Tzvetkov [11]. More explicitly, we are able refine the arguments in the recent work of Blair and the authors [3] to obtain no-loss $L^p_tL^{q}_{x}$-estimates on intervals of length $\log \lambda\cdot \lambda^{-1} $ for all {\em admissible} pairs $(p,q)$ when the initial data have frequencies comparable to $\lambda$, which, given the role of the Ehrenfest time, is the natural analog in this setting of the universal results in [11]. We achieve this log-gain over the universal estimates by applying the Keel-Tao theorem along with improved global kernel estimates for microlocalized operators which exploit the geometric assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We classify the solutions of the planar weighted Allen-Cahn equation arising from the critical equivariant $SO(4)$ Yang-Mills problem. We first give a complete classification for radially symmetric solutions, and then without symmetry assumptions, we show bounded classical solutions are radially symmetric and also classify them.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic lower bound for the radius of spatial analyticity for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov and modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem (IVP) for the 2D generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \partial_{t}u+\partial_{x}\Delta u+\mu \partial_{x}u^{k+1}=0, \,\;\; (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2, \, t \in \mathbb{R},\\ u(x,y,0)=u_0(x,y), \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Delta=\partial_x^2+\partial_y^2$, $\mu=\pm 1$, $k=1,2$ and the initial data $u_0$ is real analytic in a strip around the $x$-axis of the complex plane and have radius of spatial analyticity $\sigma_0$. For both $k=1$ and $k=2$ we prove that there exists $T_0&gt;0$ such that the radius of spatial analyticity of the solution remains the same in the time interval $[-T_0, T_0]$. We also consider the evolution of the radius of spatial analyticity when the local solution extends globally in time. For the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation ($k=1$), we prove that, in both focusing ($\mu=1$) and defocusing ($\mu=-1$) cases, and for any $T&gt; T_0$, the radius of analyticity cannot decay faster than $cT^{-4+\epsilon}$, $\epsilon&gt;0$, $c&gt;0$. For the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation ($k=2)$ in the defocusing case ($\mu=-1$), we prove that the radius of spatial analyticity cannot decay faster than $cT^{-\frac{4}{3}}$, $c&gt;0$, for any $T&gt;T_0$. These results on the algebraic lower bounds for the evolution of the radius of analyticity improve the ones obtained by Shan and Zhang in [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 501 (2021) 125218] and by Quian and Shan in [Nonlinear Analysis, 235 (2023) 113344] where the authors have obtained lower bounds involving exponential decay.</description>

      <title>On the Hardy-H\'enon heat equation with an inverse square potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Cauchy problem for the Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation with an inverse square potential, namely, \[\partial_tu -\Delta u+a|x|^{-2} u= |x|^{\gamma} F_{\alpha}(u),\] where $a\ge-(\frac{d-2}{2})^2,$ $\gamma\in \mathbb R$, $\alpha&gt;1$ and $F_{\alpha}(u)=\mu |u|^{\alpha-1}u, \mu|u|^\alpha$ or $\mu u^\alpha$, $\mu\in \{-1,0,1\}$. We establish sharp fixed time-time decay estimates for heat semigroups $e^{-t (-\Delta + a|x|^{-2})}$ in weighted Lebesgue spaces, which is of independent interest. As an application, we establish:
  $\bullet$ Local well-posedness (LWP) in scale subcritical and critical weighted Lebesgue spaces.
  $\bullet$ Small data global existence in critical weighted Lebesgue spaces.
  $\bullet$ Under certain conditions on $\gamma$ and $\alpha,$ we show that local solution cannot be extended to global one for certain initial data in the subcritical regime. Thus, finite time blow-up in the subcritical Lebesgue space norm is exhibited.
  $\bullet$ We also demonstrate nonexistence of local positive weak solution (and hence failure of LWP) in supercritical case for $\alpha&gt;1+\frac{2+\gamma}{d}$ the Fujita exponent. This indicates that subcriticality or criticality are necessary in the first point above.
  In summary, we establish a sharp dissipative estimate and addresses short and long time behaviors of solutions. In particular, we complement several classical results and shed new light on the dynamics of the considered equation.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of least energy positive solutions to critical Schr\"{o}dinger systems with Hardy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the following coupled Schr\"{o}dinger system with Hardy potential in the critical case \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u_{i}-\frac{\lambda_{i}}{|x|^2}u_{i}=|u_i|^{2^*-2}u_i+\sum_{j\neq i}^{3}\beta_{ij}|u_{j}|^{\frac{2^*}{2}}|u_i|^{\frac{2^*}{2}-2}u_i, ~x\in \mathbb{R}^N, u_i\in D^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^N),\,\, N\geq 3,\,\, i=1,2,3, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$, $\lambda_i\in (0,\Lambda_N), \Lambda_N:= \frac{(N-2)^2}{4}$, $\beta_{ij}=\beta_{ji}$ for $i \neq j$. By virtue of variational methods, we establish the existence and nonexistence of least energy solutions for the purely cooperative case ($\beta_{ij}&gt; 0$ for any $i\neq j$) and the simultaneous cooperation and competition case ($\beta_{i_{1}j_{1}}&gt;0$ and $\beta_{i_{2}j_{2}}&lt;0$ for some $(i_{1}, j_{1})$ and $(i_{2}, j_{2})$). Moreover, it is shown that fully nontrivial ground state solutions exist when $\beta_{ij}\ge0$ and $N\ge5$, but {\bf NOT} in the weakly pure cooperative case ($\beta_{ij}&gt;0$ and small, $i\neq j$) when $N=3,4$. We emphasize that this reveals that the existence of ground state solutions differs dramatically between $N=3, 4$ and higher dimensions $N\geq 5$. In particular, the cases of $N=3$ and $N\geq 5$ are more complicated than the case of $N=4$ and the proofs heavily depend on the dimension. Some novel tricks are introduced for $N=3$ and $N\ge5$.</description>

      <title>Global Stability of the Boltzmann Equation for a Polyatomic Gas with Initial Data Allowing Large Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Boltzmann equation for a polyatomic gas. We establish that the mild solution to the Boltzmann equation on the torus is globally well-posed, provided the initial data that satisfy bounded velocity-weighted $L^{\infty}$ norm and the smallness condition on the initial relative entropy. Furthermore, we also study the asymptotic behavior of solutions, converging to the global Maxwellian with an exponential rate. A key point in the proof is to develop the pointwise estimate on the gain term of non-linear collision operator for Gr\"{o}nwall's argument.</description>

      <title>Regularity of unconstrained $p$-harmonic maps from curved domain and application to critical $n$-Laplace systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $p\geq 2$ and a map $g : B^n(0,1)\to S_n^{++}$, where $S_n^{++}$ is the group of positively definite matrices, we study critical points of the following functional: $$ v\in W^{1,p}\left(B^n(0,1);\mathbb{R}^N \right) \mapsto \int_{B^n(0,1)} |\nabla v|^p_g\, d\mathrm{vol}_g = \int_{B^n(0,1)} \left( g^{\alpha\beta}(x) \left\langle \partial_\alpha v(x), \partial_\beta v(x) \right\rangle \right)^{\frac{p}{2}}\, \sqrt{\det g(x)}\, dx. $$ We show that if $g$ is uniformly close to a constant matrix, then $v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. If $g$ is H\"older-continuous, we show that $\nabla v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. As an application, we specialize to the case $p=n$ and we prove that any continuous solution to $|\Delta_{g,n}u|\lesssim |\nabla u|^n_g$ satisfies additional regularity properties depending on the regularity of $g$.</description>

      <title>Existence, non-existence and degeneracy of limit solutions to $p$-Laplace problems involving Hardy potentials as $p\to1^+$. The case of a critical drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behaviour as $p\to 1^+$ of solutions $u_p$ to $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{rclr} -\Delta_pu&amp;=&amp;\lambda|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\cdot\frac{x}{|x|^2}+ f&amp;\quad \mbox{ in } \Omega,\\ u_p&amp;=&amp;0 &amp;\quad \mbox{ on }\partial\Omega, \end{array}\right. $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with Lipschitz boundary containing the origin, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, and $f$ is a nonnegative datum in $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$. As a consequence, under suitable smallness assumptions on $f$ and $\lambda$, we show sharp existence results of bounded solutions to the Dirichlet problems $$\begin{cases}
  \displaystyle - \Delta_{1} u = \lambda\frac{D u}{|D u|}\cdot \frac{x}{|x|^2}+f &amp; \text{in}\, \Omega,
  u=0 &amp; \text{on}\ \partial \Omega, 
  \end{cases} $$
  where $\displaystyle \Delta_{1}u=\hbox{div}\,\left(\frac{Du}{|Du|}\right) $ is the $1$-Laplacian operator. The case of a generic drift term in $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$ is also considered.
  Explicits examples are given in order to show the optimality of the main assumptions on the data.</description>

      <title>The long way of a viscous vortex dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a viscous vortex dipole in $R^2$ originating from a pair of point vortices with opposite circulations. At high Reynolds number $Re &gt;&gt; 1$, the dipole can travel a very long way, compared to the distance between the vortex centers, before being slowed down and eventually destroyed by diffusion. In this regime we construct an accurate approximation of the solution in the form of a two-parameter asymptotic expansion involving the aspect ratio of the dipole and the inverse Reynolds number. We then show that the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations remains close to the approximation on a time interval of length $O(Re^\sigma)$, where $\sigma &lt; 1$ is arbitrary. This improves upon previous results which were essentially restricted to $\sigma = 0$. As an application, we provide a rigorous justification of an existing formula which gives the leading order correction to the translation speed of the dipole due to finite size effects.</description>

      <title>On global dynamics of $3$-D irrotational compressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider global-in-time evolution of irrotational, isentropic, compressible Euler flow in $3$-D, for a broad class of $H^4$ classical Cauchy data without assuming symmetry, prescribed on an annulus surrounded by a constant state in the exterior. By giving a sufficient condition on the initial data and using the nonlinear structure of the compressible Euler equations, we show that the decay rate of the first order transversal derivative of the normalized density is better than that of the same derivative of a free wave, provided that the perturbation arising from the tangential derivatives can be properly controlled for all $t$ by using a bootstrap argument. Based on this key analysis, we construct global exterior solutions in $H^4$ for the broad class of data, with a rather general subclass forming rarefaction at null infinity. Our result does not require smallness on the transversal derivatives of classical data, thus applies to data with a total energy of any size.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Control for Diffusion Aggregation system with Coulomb Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean field control problem for a multi-dimensional diffusion-aggregation system with Coulomb interaction is considered. The existence of optimal control is proved through the Gamma convergence of the control problem of a regularized particle control problem. The optimal control problem on the particle level is studied by using the corresponding Liouville equation. Because of strong aggregation effect, additional difficulties arises from control function in the well-posedness theory, so that the known method for multi-dimensional Keller-Segel equation can not be directly applied. We use a combination of local existence result and boot-strap argument to obtain the global solution with small initial data. Since we obtain a strong propagation of chaos result by combining the convergence in probability and relative entropy method, the compact support requirement for control functions, which has been often used in the literature, is not need.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich. Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau, we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the ST-CMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: One of the most celebrated problems in Euclidean Harmonic analysis is the Carleson's problem: determining the optimal regularity of the initial condition $f$ of the Schr\"odinger equation given by \begin{equation*}\begin{cases} i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =\Delta u\:,\: (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \\ u(0,\cdot)=f\:, \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^n \:, \end{cases}\end{equation*} in terms of the index $\alpha$ such that $f$ belongs to the inhomogeneous Sobolev space $H^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ , so that the solution of the Schr\"odinger operator $u$ converges pointwise to $f$, $\lim_{t \to 0+} u(x,t)=f(x)$, almost everywhere. In this article, we consider the Carleson's problem for the Schr\"odinger equation with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces and obtain the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\alpha \ge 1/4$, which agrees with the classical Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Dispersive decay estimates for Dirac equations with a domain wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersive time-decay estimates are proved for a one-parameter family of one-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonians with dislocations; these are operators which interpolate between two phase-shifted massive Dirac Hamiltonians at $x=+\infty$ and $x=-\infty$. This family of Hamiltonians arises in the theory of topologically protected states of one-dimensional quantum materials. For certain values of the phase-shift parameter, $\tau$, the Dirac Hamiltonian has a {\it threshold resonance} at the endpoint of its essential spectrum. Such resonances are known to influence the time-decay rate. Our main result explicitly displays the transition in time-decay rate as $\tau$ varies between resonant and non-resonant values. Our results appear to be the first dispersive time-decay estimates for Dirac Hamiltonians which are not a relatively compact perturbation of a free Dirac operator.</description>

Abstract: A celebrated result by Gidas, Ni &amp; Nirenberg asserts that classical positive solutions to semilinear equations $- \Delta u = f(u)$ in a ball vanishing at the boundary must be radial and radially decreasing. In this paper we consider small perturbations of this equation and study the quantitative stability counterpart of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence and regularity of weak solutions for the following system \begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\mbox{div}(M(x)\nabla u) + g(x,u,v) = f \ \ \mbox{in} \ \ \Omega\\ -\mbox{div}(M(x)\nabla v) = h(x,u,v) \ \ \mbox{in} \ \ \Omega\\ \ \ \ \ \ u=v=0 \ \ \mbox{on} \ \ \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \end{align*}
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$, for $N&gt;2$, $f\in L^m(\Omega)$, where $m&gt;1$ and $h,\ g$ are two Carath\'eodory functions. We prove that under appropriate conditions on $g$ and $h$ there exist solutions which escape the predicted regularity by the classical Stampacchia's theory causing the so-called regularizing effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Perron-Frobenius theory using a variational approach and extend it to a set of arbitrary matrices, including those that are neither irreducible nor essentially positive, and non-preserved cones. We introduce a new concept called a quasi-eigenvalue of a matrix, which is invariant under orthogonal transformations of variables, and has various useful properties, such as determining the largest value of the real parts of the eigenvalues of a matrix. We extend Weyl's inequality for the eigenvalues to the set of arbitrary matrices and prove the new stability result to the Perron root of irreducible nonnegative matrices under arbitrary perturbations. As well as this, we obtain new types of estimates for the ranges of the sets of eigenvalues and their real parts.</description>

      <title>Time-fractional discrete diffusion equation for Schr\"{o}dinger operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to investigate the semi-classical analog of the general Caputo-type diffusion equation with time-dependent diffusion coefficient associated with the discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator, $\mathcal{H}_{\hbar,V}:=-\hbar^{-2}\mathcal{L}_{\hbar}+V$ on the lattice $\hbar\mathbb{Z}^{n},$ where $V$ is a non-negative multiplication operator and $\mathcal{L}_{\hbar}$ is the discrete Laplacian. We establish the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the general Caputo-type diffusion equation with a regular coefficient in the associated Sobolev-type spaces. However, it is very weakly well-posed when the diffusion coefficient has a distributional singularity. Finally, we recapture the classical solution (resp. very weak) for the general Caputo-type diffusion equation in the semi-classical limit $\hbar\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Stability and instability of the quasilinear Gross--Pitaevskii dark solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity. In previous works, we obtained a continuous branch of traveling waves, given by dark solitons indexed by their speed. Neglecting the quasilinear term, one recovers the Gross--Pitaevskii equation, for which the branch of dark solitons is stable. Moreover, Z.~Lin showed that the Vakhitov--Kolokolov~(VK) stability criterion (in terms of the momentum of solitons) holds for general semilinear equations with nonvanishing conditions at infinity.
  In the quasilinear case, we prove that the VK stability criterion still applies, by generalizing Lin's arguments. Therefore, we deduce that the branch of dark solitons is stable for weak quasilinear interactions. For stronger quasilinear interactions, a cusp appears in the energy-momentum diagram, implying the stability of fast waves and the instability of slow waves.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity of the inverse for minimizers of the neo-Hookean energy satisfying condition INV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and regularity of minimizers of the neo-Hookean energy in the closure of classes of deformations without cavitation. The exclusion of cavitation is imposed in the form of the divergence identities, which is equivalent to the well-known condition INV with $\text{Det} = \det$. We show that the neo-Hookean energy admits minimizers in classes of maps that are one-to-one a.e. with positive Jacobians, provided that these maps are the weak limits of sequences of maps that satisfy the divergence identities. In particular, these classes include the weak closure of diffeomorphisms and the weak closure of homeomorphisms satisfying Lusin's N condition. Moreover, if the minimizers satisfy condition INV, then their inverses have Sobolev regularity. This extends a recent result by Dole\v{z}alov\'{a}, Hencl, and Molchanova by showing that the minimizers they obtained enjoy extra regularity properties, and that the existence of minimizers can still be obtained even when their coercivity assumption is relaxed.</description>

      <title>A fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality of Michael-Simon type on convex hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a fractional version of a Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type interpolation inequality on hypersurfaces $M\subset\R^{n+1}$ which are boundaries of convex sets. The inequality carries a universal constant independent of $M$ and involves the fractional mean curvature of $M.$ In particular, it interpolates between the fractional Micheal-Simon Sobolev inequality recently obtained by Cabr\'e, Cozzi, and the first author, and a new fractional Hardy inequality on $M$. Our method, when restricted to the plane case $M=\R^n$, gives a new simple proof of the fractional Hardy inequality. To obtain the fractional Hardy inequality on a hypersurface, we establish an inequality which bounds a weighted perimeter of $M$ by the standard perimeter of $M$ (modulo a universal constant), and which is valid for all convex hypersurfaces $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article continues the research initiated in [17]. We derive explicit formulae for the leading order profiles of eleven types of stationary solutions to a one-dimensional two-layer thin-film liquid model considered with an intermolecular potential depending on both layer heights. The found solutions are composed of the repeated elementary blocks (bulk, contact line and ultra-thin film ones) being consistently asymptotically matched together. We show that once considered on a finite interval with Neumann boundary conditions these stationary solutions are either dynamically stable or weakly translationally unstable. Other composite solutions are found to be numerically unstable and rather exhibit complex coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-unique ergodicity for deterministic and stochastic 3D Navier--Stokes and Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of infinitely many stationary solutions, as well as ergodic stationary solutions, to the three dimensional Navier--Stokes and Euler equations in both deterministic and stochastic settings, driven by additive noise. These solutions belong to the regularity class $C(\mathbb{R};H^{\vartheta})\cap C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{R};L^{2})$ for some $\vartheta&gt;0$ and satisfy the equations in an analytically weak sense. The solutions to the Euler equations are obtained as vanishing viscosity limits of stationary solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations. Furthermore, regardless of their construction, every stationary solution to the Euler equations within this regularity class, which satisfies a suitable moment bound, is a limit in law of stationary analytically weak solutions to Navier--Stokes equations with vanishing viscosities. Our results are based on a novel stochastic version of the convex integration method, which provides uniform moment bounds locally in the aforementioned function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an induction heating problem in a multi-component system containing a moving non-magnetic conductor. The electromagnetic process is described by the eddy current model, and the heat transfer process is governed by the convection-diffusion equation. Both processes are coupled by a restrained Joule heat source. A temporal discretization scheme is introduced to solve the corresponding variational system numerically. With the aid of the Reynolds transport theorem, we prove the convergence of the proposed scheme as well as the well-posedness of the variational problem. Some numerical experiments are also performed to assess the performance of the numerical scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the atomistic spin system in $\rm CrCl_{3}$, which exhibits topologically nontrivial meron structures within its layered hexagonal lattice framework. We analyze the complete model of discrete spin dynamics on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice and demonstrate its convergence to the continuum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the weak sense. The primary challenge lies in defining appropriate difference quotient and interpolation operators for the hexagonal lattice since the loss of symmetry. To address these, we utilized a one-step difference quotient for the 2nd nearest neighbors and introduced novel multi-step difference quotients for the 1st and 3rd nearest neighbors, enabling the integration by parts formula. Additionally, we generalized Ladysenskaya's interpolation operator for hexagonal lattices and provided an alternative strategy for the convergence procedure by applying an isometric mapping property. This work provides necessary tools for analyzing weak convergence in other atomistic nonlinear problems on hexagonal lattices towards the continuum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quaternionic Calabi conjecture, posed by Alesker and Verbitsky \cite{Alesker-Verbitsky (2010)}, predicts that the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation can always be solved on any compact HKT manifold. Motivated by this conjecture, we will introduce a quaternionic version of the Gauduchon conjecture on any compact $SL(n,\mathbb{H})$-manifold, specifically addressing the existence of quaternionic Gauduchon metrics with prescribed volume form. We reframe this question as a special case of fully nonlinear elliptic equations of second order and subsequently establish a uniform estimate for the potential function.</description>

      <title>Upper Semicontinuity of Index Plus Nullity for Minimal and CMC Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of bubble converging minimal hypersurfaces, or H-CMC hypersurfaces, in compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary, of dimension 4, 5, 6 or 7, and prove upper semicontinuity of index plus nullity, for such a bubble converging sequence. This complements the previously known lower semicontinuity of index obtained by Buzano--Sharp, and Bourni--Sharp--Tinaglia.
  The strategy of our proof is to analyse a weighted eigenvalue problem along our sequence of hypersurfaces. This strategy is inspired by the recent work of Da Lio--Gianocca--Rivi\`{e}re. A key aspect of our proof is making use of a Lorentz--Sobolev inequality to study the behaviour of these weighted eigenfunctions on the neck regions along the sequence, as well as the index and nullity of our non-compact bubbles.</description>
