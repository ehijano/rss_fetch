      <title>Game-Theoretic Coordination For Time-Critical Missions of UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative missions involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments pose significant challenges in ensuring both coordination and agility. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic approach for time-critical missions, where each UAV optimizes a cost function that incorporates temporal and mission-specific constraints. The optimization is performed within a one-dimensional domain, significantly reducing the computational cost and enabling real-time application to complex and dynamic scenarios. The framework is distributed in structure, allowing to achieve global, system-wide coordination (a Nash equilibrium) by using only local information. For ideal systems, we prove the existence and exponential stability of the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we invoke model predictive control (MPC) for non-ideal scenarios. In particular, we propose a discrete-time optimization approach that tackles path-following errors and communication failures, ensuring reliable and agile performance in dynamic and uncertain environments. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and agility of the approach in ensuring successful mission execution across diverse scenarios. Experiments using a motion capture system provide further validation under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Unification of Consensus-Based Multi-Objective Optimization and Multi-Robot Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems seeking consensus may also have other objective functions to optimize, requiring the research of multi-objective optimization in consensus. Several recent publications have explored this domain using various methods such as weighted-sum optimization and penalization methods. This paper reviews the state of the art for consensus-based multi-objective optimization, poses a multi-agent lunar rover exploration problem seeking consensus and maximization of explored area, and achieves optimal edge weights and steering angles by applying SQP algorithms.</description>

      <title>AgentDynEx: Nudging the Mechanics and Dynamics of Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model simulations have the potential to model complex human behaviors and interactions. If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</description>

      <title>PestMA: LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Informed Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective pest management is complex due to the need for accurate, context-specific decisions. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) open new possibilities for addressing these challenges by providing sophisticated, adaptive knowledge acquisition and reasoning. However, existing LLM-based pest management approaches often rely on a single-agent paradigm, which can limit their capacity to incorporate diverse external information, engage in systematic validation, and address complex, threshold-driven decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PestMA, an LLM-based multi-agent system (MAS) designed to generate reliable and evidence-based pest management advice. Building on an editorial paradigm, PestMA features three specialized agents, an Editor for synthesizing pest management recommendations, a Retriever for gathering relevant external data, and a Validator for ensuring correctness. Evaluations on real-world pest scenarios demonstrate that PestMA achieves an initial accuracy of 86.8% for pest management decisions, which increases to 92.6% after validation. These results underscore the value of collaborative agent-based workflows in refining and validating decisions, highlighting the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to automate and enhance pest management processes.</description>

      <title>Metropolis-Hastings Captioning Game: Knowledge Fusion of Vision Language Models via Decentralized Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Metropolis-Hastings Captioning Game (MHCG), a method to fuse knowledge of multiple vision-language models (VLMs) by learning from each other. Although existing methods that combine multiple models suffer from inference costs and architectural constraints, MHCG avoids these problems by performing decentralized Bayesian inference through a process resembling a language game. The knowledge fusion process establishes communication between two VLM agents alternately captioning images and learning from each other. We conduct two image-captioning experiments with two VLMs, each pre-trained on a different dataset. The first experiment demonstrates that MHCG achieves consistent improvement in reference-free evaluation metrics. The second experiment investigates how MHCG contributes to sharing VLMs' category-level vocabulary by observing the occurrence of the vocabulary in the generated captions.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Social Cost in Multi-Agent General Reinforcement Learning: Survey and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AI safety literature is full of examples of powerful AI agents that, in blindly pursuing a specific and usually narrow objective, ends up with unacceptable and even catastrophic collateral damage to others. In this paper, we consider the problem of social harms that can result from actions taken by learning and utility-maximising agents in a multi-agent environment. The problem of measuring social harms or impacts in such multi-agent settings, especially when the agents are artificial generally intelligent (AGI) agents, was listed as an open problem in Everitt et al, 2018. We attempt a partial answer to that open problem in the form of market-based mechanisms to quantify and control the cost of such social harms. The proposed setup captures many well-studied special cases and is more general than existing formulations of multi-agent reinforcement learning with mechanism design in two ways: (i) the underlying environment is a history-based general reinforcement learning environment like in AIXI; (ii) the reinforcement-learning agents participating in the environment can have different learning strategies and planning horizons. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed setup, we survey some key classes of learning algorithms and present a few applications, including a discussion of the Paperclips problem and pollution control with a cap-and-trade system.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: Advances, Expert Insights, and A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</description>

      <title>Attention-Augmented Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolutions for Multi-Agent Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.
  Multi-agent task allocation (MATA) plays a vital role in cooperative multi-agent systems, with significant implications for applications such as logistics, search and rescue, and robotic coordination. Although traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been shown to be promising, their effectiveness is hindered by a reliance on manually designed reward functions and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. In this paper, an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework is proposed, in which multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and graph attention mechanisms are incorporated to enhance reward function learning and task execution efficiency. Expert demonstrations are utilized to infer optimal reward densities, allowing dependence on handcrafted designs to be reduced and adaptability to be improved. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method over widely used multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms in terms of both cumulative rewards and task execution efficiency.</description>
