Abstract: An element $x$ of a lattice $L$ is modular if $L$ has no five-element sublattice isomorphic to the pentagon in which $x$ would correspond to the lonely midpoint. In the present work, we classify all modular elements of the lattice of all monoid varieties.</description>

      <title>Surjunctivity does not characterize cosoficity of invariant random subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group is surjunctive if every injective cellular automaton on it is also surjective. Gottschalk famously conjectured that all groups are surjunctive. This remains a central open problem in symbolic dynamics and descriptive set theory. Gromov and Weiss termed the notion of sofic groups, and proved that all such groups are surjunctive, providing the largest class of groups which satisfy Gottschalk's conjecture. It is still open to decide whether all groups are sofic. This became a major open problem in group theory, and is related to other well known problems such as the Aldous--Lyons conjecture in probability theory and to Connes' embedding problem in the theory of operator algebras.
  A complementary natural question to ask is: Does the reverse implication to Gromov and Weiss' result holds? Namely, are all surjunctive groups sofic? As currently there are no known non-sofic groups, answering this problem in the negative in the category of groups is still out of reach. This paper resolves this problem in the generalized setup of invariant random subgroups of free groups (IRSs), where non (co)sofic objects were recently shown to exist by Lubotzky, Vidick and the two authors. Specifically, we prove that there exists a surjunctive non (co)sofic IRS, resolving the aforementioned problem in the negative. Our proof uses a complexity theoretic approach, and in particular a recent development due to Manzoor, as well as the theory of Rokhlin entropy developed by Seward and others. As a byproduct of our proof technique, the non (co)sofic IRS we provide satisfies a condition stronger than surjunctivity; it satisfies a version of Seward's maximal Rokhlin entropy of Bernoulli Shifts (RBS) criterion.</description>

      <title>The growth of residually soluble groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of Wilson, we show that if $G$ is a finitely generated residually soluble group whose growth function $\gamma$ satisfies $(\log \gamma(n))/ n^{1/4} \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ then $G$ is virtually nilpotent. This shows that Grigorchuk's Gap Conjecture holds for all exponents $\beta &lt; 1/4$ within the class of residually soluble groups (improving Wilson's exponent $1/6$). We also discuss stronger versions of the Gap Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Endogenies and linearization in the non-virtually connected case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a linearization theorem for pre-rings of endogenies acting on a definable abelian group of finite dimension. Observe that no assumptions on the connectivity of A are made. We also prove a similar result when one of the two pre-rings is of quasi-endomorphisms. A corollary of these results is a generalization of Zilber's Field Theorem for finite-dimensional theories.</description>

      <title>A converse for a theorem of Gallagher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. Suppose $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Recall that Gallagher's theorem states that if $\chi \in {\rm Irr} (G)$ satisfies $\chi_N$ is irreducible, then $\chi \beta$ is irreducible and distinct for all $\beta \in {\rm Irr} (G/N)$. Furthermore, if $\theta = \chi_N$, then these are all of the irreducible constituents of $\theta^G$. We prove that the converse of this theorem holds. We also prove that a partial converse of the Brauer version of this theorem holds. Finally, we prove that an analog of Gallagher's theorem holds for Isaacs' $\pi$-partial characters and that a partial converse of that theorem is true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel connection between reductions of companion matrices associated with a symmetric family of certain binomial ideals in the coordinate ring of affine n-space and permutation matrices. Specifically, for fixed monomial orders, we observe that the reduced companion matrices yield permutation matrices satisfying group-theoretic relations. We explore the implications of these reductions, their connections to lattice ideals, and characterize the groups generated by these transformations.</description>

      <title>The limit cone and bounds on the growth indicator function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a real semisimple Lie group $G$ with finite center and a discrete subgroup $\Gamma \subset G$ whose limit cone is disjoint from two facets of the Weyl chamber we show that Quint's growth indicator function $\psi_\Gamma$ is bounded by the half sum of positive roots $\rho$, i.e. it has slow growth, implying that the representation $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$ is tempered. In particular, this holds for each $I$-Anosov subgroup provided that $I$ contains at least two distinct simple roots that are not interchanged by the opposition involution.</description>

      <title>Some explicit cocycles on the Furstenberg boundary for products of isometries of hyperbolic spaces and $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{K})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nicolas Monod showed that the evaluation map $H^*_m(G\curvearrowright G/P)\longrightarrow H^*_m(G)$ between the measurable cohomology of the action of a connected semisimple Lie group $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ and the measurable cohomology of $G$ is surjective with a kernel that can be entirely described in terms of invariants in the cohomology of a maximal split torus $A&lt;G$. In a recent paper we refine Monod's result and show in particular that the cohomology of non-alternating cocycles on $G/P$ is in general not trivial and lies in the kernel of the evaluation. In this paper we describe explicitly such non-alternating and alternating cocycles on $G/P$ in low degrees when $G$ is either a product of isometries of real hyperbolic spaces or $G=\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{K})$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is either the real or the complex field. As a consequence, we deduce that the comparison map $H^*_{m,b}(G)\rightarrow H^*_m(G)$ from the measurable bounded cohomology is injective in degree $3$ for nontrivial products of isometries of hyperbolic spaces. We get also another proof of the injectivity for $G=\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{K})$, when $\mathbb{K}$ is either the real field or the complex one.</description>

Abstract: We consider the cyclically presented groups defined by cyclic presentations with $2m$ generators $x_i$ whose relators are the $2m$ positive length three relators $x_ix_{i+1}x_{i+m-1}$. We show that they are hyperbolic if and only if $m\in \{1,2,3,6,9\}$. This completes the classification of the hyperbolic cyclically presented groups with positive length three relators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of abelian groups that exhibit a high degree of freeness while possessing no non-trivial homomorphisms to a canonical free object. Unlike prior investigations, which primarily focused on torsion-free groups, our work broadens the scope to include groups with torsion. Our main focus is on p-groups, for which we formulate and prove the Trivial Duality Conjecture. Key tools in our analysis include the multi black box method and the application of specific homological properties of relative trees.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which is in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an application, we prove that the critical exponent is lower semicontinuous in the Chabauty topology, in the following sense: if a sequence of Zariski dense discrete subgroups $\{\Gamma_{n}\}$ of $G$ converges in the Chabauty topology to a Zariski dense discrete subgroup $\Gamma$, then $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \delta(\Gamma_{n}) \geq \delta(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>On dense orbits in the space of subequivalence relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first explain how to endow the space of subequivalence relations of any non-singular countable equivalence relation with a Polish topology, extending the framework of Kechris' recent monograph on subequivalence relations of probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.) countable equivalence relations. We then restrict to p.m.p. equivalence relations and discuss dense orbits therein for the natural action of the full group and of the automorphism group of the relation. Our main result is a characterization of the subequivalence relations having a dense orbit in the space of subequivalence relations of the ergodic hyperfinite p.m.p. equivalence relation. We also show that in this setup, all full groups orbits are meager. We finally provide a few Borel complexity calculations of natural subsets in spaces of subequivalence relations using a natural metric we call the uniform metric. This answers some questions from an earlier version of Kechris' monograph.</description>

      <title>Property (T) group factors whose Jones index set equals all positive integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a m\'elange of techniques at the rich intersection of deformation/rigidity theory, finite index subfactor theory, and geometric group theory, we prove the existence of a continuum of property (T) factors that are pairwise non-stably isomorphic and whose Jones index sets consist of all positive integers. These factors are realized as group von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{L}(G)$ associated with property (T) generalized wreath-like product groups $G \in \mathscr{WR}(A, B \curvearrowright I)$ introduced in [CIOS23b], where $A$ is abelian, $B$ is a non-parabolic subgroup of a relatively hyperbolic group with residually finite peripheral structure, and $B \curvearrowright I$ is a faithful action with infinite orbits. Integer index subfactors of $\mathcal{L}(G)$ are constructed from extensions of $G$. This result advances an open question of P. de la Harpe [dlH95].</description>
