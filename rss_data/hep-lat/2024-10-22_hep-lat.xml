      <title>Quark mass effects in octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities via lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark mass dependence of octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities is examined at the level of individual quark-sector contributions in the uniform background-field approach of lattice QCD. The aim is to understand the direct impact of increasing the mass of a quark flavour on the magnetic polarisability and indirect or environmental effects associated with changing the mass of spectator quarks, insensitive to the background magnetic field. Noting the need to set the electric charge of some quark flavours to zero, a fractionally charged baryon formalism is introduced. We find that increasing the mass of the charged quark flavour directly causes its contribution to the magnetic polarisability to decrease. However, increasing the mass of the spectator quark flavour indirectly acts to increase the magnetic polarisability. To gain a deeper understanding of these effects, we evaluate the predictions of the constituent quark model in this context. While the model provides a compelling explanation for the environmental effect of varying the spectator quark mass, an explanation of the direct mass dependence is more complicated as competing factors combine in the final result. The lattice results indicate the key factor is a reduction in the constituent quark magnetic moment with increasing quark mass, as it governs the strength of the magnetic transition to the nearby decuplet baryon.</description>

      <title>Perturbative gradient flow coupling of the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with the numerical stochastic perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient flow scheme has emerged as a prominent nonperturbative renormalization scheme on the lattice, where flow time is introduced to define the renormalization scale. In this study we perturbatively compute the gradient flow coupling for the SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory in the large-$N$ limit in terms of the lattice bare coupling up to three-loop order. This is achieved by combining the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with the numerical stochastic perturbation theory. We analyze the flow time dependence of the perturbative coefficients to determine the perturbative beta function coefficients, successfully computing the one-loop coefficient in the large-$N$ limit using three matrix sizes $N=289,441,529$. However, the higher-order coefficients are affected by large statistical errors. We also explore the potential for reducing these statistical errors through variance reduction combined with the large-$N$ factorization property of the SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory, and estimate the required number of samples for the precise determination of the higher-order coefficients.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the mass spectra and electromagnetic properties of $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. In addition, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay width, shedding light on their inner structures within the constituent quark model framework. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays, by analyzing the $\bar K \bar K \pi$ invariant mass spectrum. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point from first principles through contours of constant entropy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the three-neutron quantization condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of the three-neutron quantization condition (QC) derived in previous work. We construct the matrices appearing in the QC and determine solutions numerically. The symmetries of the QC allow the projection onto irreducible representations of the appropriate little group (depending on frame momentum), restricting the size of the matrices and reducing computational complexity. In this initial study, we include only two-neutron interactions, which are modeled based on experimental data for $I=1$ scattering amplitudes. We show examples of the finite-volume spectrum in two frames and for a range of energies, illustrating the potential and also the challenges of using three-neutron spectroscopy to constrain the underlying interactions.</description>

      <title>Molecular charmed baryons and pentaquarks from light-meson exchange saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the $c qq$ baryons contains a few states whose nature is not clearly a three-quark composite and which might have a sizable baryon-meson component. Examples include the $\Sigma_c(2800)$ or the $\Lambda_c(2940)$. Here we explore the spectrum of two-body systems composed of a light, octet baryon and a charmed meson (or antimeson) within a simple contact-range theory in which the couplings are saturated by light-meson exchanges. This results in the prediction of a series of composite anticharmed pentaquarks ($\bar{c} q qqq $) and singly-charmed baryons ($c \bar{q} qqq $). Among the later we find $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\Xi D$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\Xi D^*$ bound states with masses matching those of the recently observed $\Omega_c(3185)$ and $\Omega_c(3327)$ baryons.</description>

      <title>A model independent description of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new parameterization of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ form factors using a partial-wave expansion and derive bounds on the series coefficients using analyticity and unitarity. This is the first generalization of the model-independent formalism developed by Boyd, Grinstein, and Lebed for $B \to D \ell \nu$ to semileptonic decays with multi-hadron final states, and enables data-driven form factor determinations with robust, systematically-improvable uncertainties. Using this formalism, we extract the form-factor parameters for $B \to D_2^\ast(\to D\pi) \ell \nu$ decays in a model-independent way from fits of data from the Belle Experiment, and, for the first time, study the two-pole structure in the $D\pi$ S-wave in semileptonic decays employing lineshapes from unitarized chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Thermal state preparation of the SYK model using a variational quantum algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting,we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. This application to the timelike region assumes an approximation based on unitarity and analyticity that is valid only in the large $q^2$ region. Using the recent data from BESIII we establish the regime of validity of this approximation. We report here that our results for the effective form factor (combination of $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$) are in good agreement with the data already for $q^2$ values above 15 GeV$^2$. In addition, a more conservative onset of the validity of the approximation is provided by the newly available $|G_E/G_M|$ data which suggest that our predictions may be compared against data for $q^2 \ge $ 20 GeV$^2$. This is expected in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Neutral Operators in scalar CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$ taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to neutral operators in the $\phi^4$ in $d=4-\epsilon$, $\phi^3$ in $d=6-\epsilon$, and $\phi^6$ in $d=3-\epsilon$ theories with $O(N)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>NETS: A Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</description>
