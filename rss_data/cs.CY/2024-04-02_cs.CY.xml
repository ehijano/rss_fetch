      <title>SA-LSPL:Sequence-Aware Long- and Short- Term Preference Learning for next POI recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation aims to recommend the next POI for users at a specific time. As users' check-in records can be viewed as a long sequence, methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently shown good applicability to this task. However, existing methods often struggle to fully explore the spatio-temporal correlations and dependencies at the sequence level, and don't take full consideration for various factors influencing users' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Sequence-Aware Long- and Short-Term Preference Learning (SA-LSPL) for next-POI recommendation. We combine various information features to effectively model users' long-term preferences. Specifically, our proposed model uses a multi-modal embedding module to embed diverse check-in details, taking into account both user's personalized preferences and social influences comprehensively. Additionally, we consider explicit spatio-temporal correlations at the sequence level and implicit sequence dependencies. Furthermore, SA-LSPL learns the spatio-temporal correlations of consecutive and non-consecutive visits in the current check-in sequence, as well as transition dependencies between categories, providing a comprehensive capture of user's short-term preferences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SA-LSPL over state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imposing evolution of artificial intelligence systems and, specifically, of Large Language Models (LLM) makes it necessary to carry out assessments of their level of risk and the impact they may have in the area of privacy, personal data protection and at an ethical level, especially on the weakest and most vulnerable. This contribution addresses human oversight, ethical oversight, and privacy impact assessment.</description>

      <title>Investigating Youths' Everyday Understanding of Machine Learning Applications: a Knowledge-in-Pieces Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent calls for including artificial intelligence (AI) literacy in K-12 education, not enough attention has been paid to studying youths' everyday knowledge about machine learning (ML). Most research has examined how youths attribute intelligence to AI/ML systems. Other studies have centered on youths' theories and hypotheses about ML highlighting their misconceptions and how these may hinder learning. However, research on conceptual change shows that youths may not have coherent theories about scientific phenomena and instead have knowledge pieces that can be productive for formal learning. We investigate teens' everyday understanding of ML through a knowledge-in-pieces perspective. Our analyses reveal that youths showed some understanding that ML applications learn from training data and that applications recognize patterns in input data and depending on these provide different outputs. We discuss how these findings expand our knowledge base and implications for the design of tools and activities to introduce youths to ML.</description>

      <title>Evaluatology: The Science and Engineering of Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluation is a crucial aspect of human existence and plays a vital role in various fields. However, it is often approached in an empirical and ad-hoc manner, lacking consensus on universal concepts, terminologies, theories, and methodologies. This lack of agreement has significant repercussions. This article aims to formally introduce the discipline of evaluatology, which encompasses the science and engineering of evaluation. We propose a universal framework for evaluation, encompassing concepts, terminologies, theories, and methodologies that can be applied across various disciplines.
  Our research reveals that the essence of evaluation lies in conducting experiments that intentionally apply a well-defined evaluation condition to diverse subjects and infer the impact of different subjects by measuring and/or testing. Derived from the essence of evaluation, we propose five axioms focusing on key aspects of evaluation outcomes as the foundational evaluation theory. These axioms serve as the bedrock upon which we build universal evaluation theories and methodologies. When evaluating a single subject, it is crucial to create evaluation conditions with different levels of equivalency. By applying these conditions to diverse subjects, we can establish reference evaluation models. These models allow us to alter a single independent variable at a time while keeping all other variables as controls. When evaluating complex scenarios, the key lies in establishing a series of evaluation models that maintain transitivity. Building upon the science of evaluation, we propose a formal definition of a benchmark as a simplified and sampled evaluation condition that guarantees different levels of equivalency. This concept serves as the cornerstone for a universal benchmark-based engineering approach to evaluation across various disciplines, which we refer to as benchmarkology.</description>

      <title>Hey, Teacher, (Don't) Leave Those Kids Alone: Standardizing HRI Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating a standardized introduction course becomes more critical as the field of human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes more established. This paper outlines the key components necessary to provide an undergraduate with a sufficient foundational understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of this field and provides proposed course content. It emphasizes the importance of creating a course with theoretical and experimental components to accommodate all different learning preferences. This manuscript also advocates creating or adopting a universal platform to standardize the hands-on component of introductory HRI courses, regardless of university funding or size. Next, it recommends formal training in how to read scientific articles and staying up-to-date with the latest relevant papers. Finally, it provides detailed lecture content and project milestones for a 15-week semester. By creating a standardized course, researchers can ensure consistency and quality are maintained across institutions, which will help students as well as industrial and academic employers understand what foundational knowledge is expected.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Writing Assistants: Exploring Perspectives on Sense of Ownership and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sense of ownership in writing confines our investment of thoughts, time, and contribution, leading to attachment to the output. However, using writing assistants introduces a mental dilemma, as some content isn't directly our creation. For instance, we tend to credit Large Language Models (LLMs) more in creative tasks, even though all tasks are equal for them. Additionally, while we may not claim complete ownership of LLM-generated content, we freely claim authorship. We conduct a short survey to examine these issues and understand underlying cognitive processes in order to gain a better knowledge of human-computer interaction in writing and improve writing aid systems.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for Public and Patient Involvement in Neurotechnology in the United Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurotechnologies are increasingly becoming integrated in our everyday lives, our bodies and minds. As the popularity and impact of neurotech grows, so does our responsibility to ensure we understand its particular ethical and societal implications. Enabling end-users and other stakeholders to participate in the development of neurotechnology, even at its earliest stages of conception, will help us better navigate our design around these serious considerations, and deliver more impactful technologies. There are many different terms and frameworks to articulate the concept of involving end users in the technology development lifecycle: 'Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement' (PPIE), 'lived experience', 'co-design', 'co-production'. What is lacking are clear guidelines for implementing a robust PPIE process in neurotechnology. While general advice is available online, it is down to individuals (and their funders) to carve up their own approach to meaningful involvement. Here we present guidance for UK-based researchers and engineers to conduct PPI for neurotechnology. The overall aim is the establishment of gold-standard PPIE methodologies in the neurotechnology space that bring patient and public insights at the forefront of our scientific inquiry and product development.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Foundation of Process Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process science is a highly interdisciplinary field of research. Despite numerous proposals, process science lacks an adequate understanding of the core concepts of the field, including notions such as process, event, and system. A more systematic framework to cope with process science is mandatory. We suggest such a framework using an example. The framework itself addresses three aspects: architecture, statics, and dynamics. Corresponding formal concepts, based on established scientific theories, together provide an integrated framework for understanding processes in the world. We argue that our foundations have positive implications not only for theoretical research, but also for empirical research, e.g., because hypothesized relationships can be explicitly tested. It is now time to start a discussion about the foundations of our field.</description>

      <title>Addressing Both Statistical and Causal Gender Fairness in NLP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical fairness stipulates equivalent outcomes for every protected group, whereas causal fairness prescribes that a model makes the same prediction for an individual regardless of their protected characteristics. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) is effective for reducing bias in NLP models, yet models trained with CDA are often evaluated only on metrics that are closely tied to the causal fairness notion; similarly, sampling-based methods designed to promote statistical fairness are rarely evaluated for causal fairness. In this work, we evaluate both statistical and causal debiasing methods for gender bias in NLP models, and find that while such methods are effective at reducing bias as measured by the targeted metric, they do not necessarily improve results on other bias metrics. We demonstrate that combinations of statistical and causal debiasing techniques are able to reduce bias measured through both types of metrics.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Privacy-Preserving Model Explanations: Privacy Risks, Attacks, and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the adoption of explainable AI (XAI) continues to expand, the urgency to address its privacy implications intensifies. Despite a growing corpus of research in AI privacy and explainability, there is little attention on privacy-preserving model explanations. This article presents the first thorough survey about privacy attacks on model explanations and their countermeasures. Our contribution to this field comprises a thorough analysis of research papers with a connected taxonomy that facilitates the categorisation of privacy attacks and countermeasures based on the targeted explanations. This work also includes an initial investigation into the causes of privacy leaks. Finally, we discuss unresolved issues and prospective research directions uncovered in our analysis. This survey aims to be a valuable resource for the research community and offers clear insights for those new to this domain. To support ongoing research, we have established an online resource repository, which will be continuously updated with new and relevant findings. Interested readers are encouraged to access our repository at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-privex.</description>

      <title>Survey of Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides an efficient and tailored method for assessing the proficiency of examinees, by dynamically adjusting test questions based on their performance. Widely adopted across diverse fields like education, healthcare, sports, and sociology, CAT has revolutionized testing practices. While traditional methods rely on psychometrics and statistics, the increasing complexity of large-scale testing has spurred the integration of machine learning techniques. This paper aims to provide a machine learning-focused survey on CAT, presenting a fresh perspective on this adaptive testing method. By examining the test question selection algorithm at the heart of CAT's adaptivity, we shed light on its functionality. Furthermore, we delve into cognitive diagnosis models, question bank construction, and test control within CAT, exploring how machine learning can optimize these components. Through an analysis of current methods, strengths, limitations, and challenges, we strive to develop robust, fair, and efficient CAT systems. By bridging psychometric-driven CAT research with machine learning, this survey advocates for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to the future of adaptive testing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniquness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Recognize Convincing Arguments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable and ever-increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their potential misuse for creating personalized, convincing misinformation and propaganda. To gain insights into LLMs' persuasive capabilities without directly engaging in experimentation with humans, we propose studying their performance on the related task of detecting convincing arguments. We extend a dataset by Durmus &amp; Cardie (2018) with debates, votes, and user traits and propose tasks measuring LLMs' ability to (1) distinguish between strong and weak arguments, (2) predict stances based on beliefs and demographic characteristics, and (3) determine the appeal of an argument to an individual based on their traits. We show that LLMs perform on par with humans in these tasks and that combining predictions from different LLMs yields significant performance gains, even surpassing human performance. The data and code released with this paper contribute to the crucial ongoing effort of continuously evaluating and monitoring the rapidly evolving capabilities and potential impact of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Metarobotics for Industry and Society: Vision, Technologies, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metarobotics aims to combine next generation wireless communication, multi-sense immersion, and collective intelligence to provide a pervasive, itinerant, and non-invasive access and interaction with distant robotized applications. Industry and society are expected to benefit from these functionalities. For instance, robot programmers will no longer travel worldwide to plan and test robot motions, even collaboratively. Instead, they will have a personalized access to robots and their environments from anywhere, thus spending more time with family and friends. Students enrolled in robotics courses will be taught under authentic industrial conditions in real-time. This paper describes objectives of Metarobotics in society, industry, and in-between. It identifies and surveys technologies likely to enable their completion and provides an architecture to put forward the interplay of key components of Metarobotics. Potentials for self-determination, self-efficacy, and work-life-flexibility in robotics-related applications in Society 5.0, Industry 4.0, and Industry 5.0 are outlined.</description>

      <title>Predictive Performance Comparison of Decision Policies Under Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive models are often introduced to decision-making tasks under the rationale that they improve performance over an existing decision-making policy. However, it is challenging to compare predictive performance against an existing decision-making policy that is generally under-specified and dependent on unobservable factors. These sources of uncertainty are often addressed in practice by making strong assumptions about the data-generating mechanism. In this work, we propose a method to compare the predictive performance of decision policies under a variety of modern identification approaches from the causal inference and off-policy evaluation literatures (e.g., instrumental variable, marginal sensitivity model, proximal variable). Key to our method is the insight that there are regions of uncertainty that we can safely ignore in the policy comparison. We develop a practical approach for finite-sample estimation of regret intervals under no assumptions on the parametric form of the status quo policy. We verify our framework theoretically and via synthetic data experiments. We conclude with a real-world application using our framework to support a pre-deployment evaluation of a proposed modification to a healthcare enrollment policy.</description>

      <title>Survey of Bias In Text-to-Image Generation: Definition, Evaluation, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of large and powerful models with Text-to-Image (T2I) generation abilities -- such as OpenAI's DALLE-3 and Google's Gemini -- enables users to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, it has become increasingly evident that even simple prompts could cause T2I models to exhibit conspicuous social bias in generated images. Such bias might lead to both allocational and representational harms in society, further marginalizing minority groups. Noting this problem, a large body of recent works has been dedicated to investigating different dimensions of bias in T2I systems. However, an extensive review of these studies is lacking, hindering a systematic understanding of current progress and research gaps. We present the first extensive survey on bias in T2I generative models. In this survey, we review prior studies on dimensions of bias: Gender, Skintone, and Geo-Culture. Specifically, we discuss how these works define, evaluate, and mitigate different aspects of bias. We found that: (1) while gender and skintone biases are widely studied, geo-cultural bias remains under-explored; (2) most works on gender and skintone bias investigated occupational association, while other aspects are less frequently studied; (3) almost all gender bias works overlook non-binary identities in their studies; (4) evaluation datasets and metrics are scattered, with no unified framework for measuring biases; and (5) current mitigation methods fail to resolve biases comprehensively. Based on current limitations, we point out future research directions that contribute to human-centric definitions, evaluations, and mitigation of biases. We hope to highlight the importance of studying biases in T2I systems, as well as encourage future efforts to holistically understand and tackle biases, building fair and trustworthy T2I technologies for everyone.</description>

      <title>Partial Mobilization: Tracking Multilingual Information Flows Amongst Russian Media Outlets and Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to disinformation and propaganda from Russian online media following the invasion of Ukraine, Russian media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik News were banned throughout Europe. To maintain viewership, many of these Russian outlets began to heavily promote their content on messaging services like Telegram. In this work, we study how 16 Russian media outlets interacted with and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. Leveraging the foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes processes, we trace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show that news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram but that they source material from the messaging platform. For example, across the websites in our study, between 2.3% (ura.news) and 26.7% (ukraina.ru) of articles discussed content that originated/resulted from activity on Telegram. Finally, tracking the spread of individual topics, we measure the rate at which news outlets and Telegram channels disseminate content within the Russian media ecosystem, finding that websites like ura.news and Telegram channels such as @genshab are the most effective at disseminating their content.</description>

      <title>Resolving Ethics Trade-offs in Implementing Responsible AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the operationalisation of high-level AI ethics principles into practical AI/ML systems has made progress, there is still a theory-practice gap in managing tensions between the underlying AI ethics aspects. We cover five approaches for addressing the tensions via trade-offs, ranging from rudimentary to complex. The approaches differ in the types of considered context, scope, methods for measuring contexts, and degree of justification. None of the approaches is likely to be appropriate for all organisations, systems, or applications. To address this, we propose a framework which consists of: (i) proactive identification of tensions, (ii) prioritisation and weighting of ethics aspects, (iii) justification and documentation of trade-off decisions. The proposed framework aims to facilitate the implementation of well-rounded AI/ML systems that are appropriate for potential regulatory requirements.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Safe Multi-Modal Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and integrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Transit Gap: A Comparative Study of On-Demand Bus Services and Urban Climate Resilience in South End, Charlotte, NC and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban design significantly impacts sustainability, particularly in the context of public transit efficiency and carbon emissions reduction. This study explores two neighborhoods with distinct urban designs: South End, Charlotte, NC, featuring a dynamic mixed-use urban design pattern, and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN, with a residential suburban grid layout. Using the TRANSIT-GYM tool, we assess the impact of increased bus utilization in these different urban settings on traffic and CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of urban design and planning in transit system efficiency. In South End, the mixed-use design led to more substantial emission reductions, indicating that urban layout can significantly influence public transit outcomes. Tailored strategies that consider the unique urban design elements are essential for climate resilience. Notably, doubling bus utilization decreased daily emissions by 10.18% in South End and 8.13% in Avondale, with a corresponding reduction in overall traffic. A target of 50% bus utilization saw emissions drop by 21.45% in South End and 14.50% in Avondale. At an idealistic goal of 70% bus utilization, South End and Avondale witnessed emission reductions of 37.22% and 27.80%, respectively. These insights are crucial for urban designers and policymakers in developing sustainable urban landscapes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and User Trust: Consequence of Self-Referential Learning Loop and the Deskilling of Healthcare Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolving relationship between clinician trust in LLMs, the transformation of data sources from predominantly human-generated to AI-generated content, and the subsequent impact on the precision of LLMs and clinician competence. One of the primary concerns identified is the potential feedback loop that arises as LLMs become more reliant on their outputs for learning, which may lead to a degradation in output quality and a reduction in clinician skills due to decreased engagement with fundamental diagnostic processes. While theoretical at this stage, this feedback loop poses a significant challenge as the integration of LLMs in healthcare deepens, emphasizing the need for proactive dialogue and strategic measures to ensure the safe and effective use of LLM technology. A key takeaway from our investigation is the critical role of user expertise and the necessity for a discerning approach to trusting and validating LLM outputs. The paper highlights how expert users, particularly clinicians, can leverage LLMs to enhance productivity by offloading routine tasks while maintaining a critical oversight to identify and correct potential inaccuracies in AI-generated content. This balance of trust and skepticism is vital for ensuring that LLMs augment rather than undermine the quality of patient care. Moreover, we delve into the potential risks associated with LLMs' self-referential learning loops and the deskilling of healthcare professionals. The risk of LLMs operating within an echo chamber, where AI-generated content feeds into the learning algorithms, threatens the diversity and quality of the data pool, potentially entrenching biases and reducing the efficacy of LLMs.</description>

      <title>You are a Bot! -- Studying the Development of Bot Accusations on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characterization and detection of bots with their presumed ability to manipulate society on social media platforms have been subject to many research endeavors over the last decade. In the absence of ground truth data (i.e., accounts that are labeled as bots by experts or self-declare their automated nature), researchers interested in the characterization and detection of bots may want to tap into the wisdom of the crowd. But how many people need to accuse another user as a bot before we can assume that the account is most likely automated? And more importantly, are bot accusations on social media at all a valid signal for the detection of bots? Our research presents the first large-scale study of bot accusations on Twitter and shows how the term bot became an instrument of dehumanization in social media conversations since it is predominantly used to deny the humanness of conversation partners. Consequently, bot accusations on social media should not be naively used as a signal to train or test bot detection models.</description>

      <title>Instructed to Bias: Instruction-Tuned Language Models Exhibit Emergent Cognitive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that instruction tuning (IT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) improve the abilities of large language models (LMs) dramatically. While these tuning methods can help align models with human objectives and generate high-quality text, not much is known about their potential adverse effects. In this work, we investigate the effect of IT and RLHF on decision making and reasoning in LMs, focusing on three cognitive biases - the decoy effect, the certainty effect, and the belief bias - all of which are known to influence human decision-making and reasoning. Our findings highlight the presence of these biases in various models from the GPT-3, Mistral, and T5 families. Notably, we find a stronger presence of biases in models that have undergone instruction tuning, such as Flan-T5, Mistral-Instruct, GPT3.5, and GPT4. Our work constitutes a step toward comprehending cognitive biases in instruction-tuned LMs, which is crucial for the development of more reliable and unbiased language models.</description>

      <title>Ensuring User-side Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User-side group fairness is crucial for modern recommender systems, aiming to alleviate performance disparities among user groups defined by sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age. In the ever-evolving landscape of user-item interactions, continual adaptation to newly collected data is crucial for recommender systems to stay aligned with the latest user preferences. However, we observe that such continual adaptation often exacerbates performance disparities. This necessitates a thorough investigation into user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems, an area that has been unexplored in the literature. This problem is challenging due to distribution shifts, frequent model updates, and non-differentiability of ranking metrics. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first principled study on ensuring user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems. We start with theoretical analyses on fine-tuning v.s. retraining, showing that the best practice is incremental fine-tuning with restart. Guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose FAir Dynamic rEcommender (FADE), an end-to-end fine-tuning framework to dynamically ensure user-side fairness over time. To overcome the non-differentiability of recommendation metrics in the fairness loss, we further introduce Differentiable Hit (DH) as an improvement over the recent NeuralNDCG method, not only alleviating its gradient vanishing issue but also achieving higher efficiency. Besides that, we also address the instability issue of the fairness loss by leveraging the competing nature between the recommendation loss and the fairness loss. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FADE effectively and efficiently reduces performance disparities with little sacrifice in the overall recommendation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, it presents a generalizable, novel framework dubbed \textit{toxicity rabbit hole} that iteratively elicits toxic content from a wide suite of large language models. Spanning a set of 1,266 identity groups, we first conduct a bias audit of \texttt{PaLM 2} guardrails presenting key insights. Next, we report generalizability across several other models. Through the elicited toxic content, we present a broad analysis with a key emphasis on racism, antisemitism, misogyny, Islamophobia, homophobia, and transphobia. Finally, driven by concrete examples, we discuss potential ramifications.</description>

      <title>Faster ISNet for Background Bias Mitigation on Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bias or spurious correlations in image backgrounds can impact neural networks, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans Effect) and hampering generalization to real-world data. ISNet, a recently introduced architecture, proposed the optimization of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP, an explanation technique) heatmaps, to mitigate the influence of backgrounds on deep classifiers. However, ISNet's training time scales linearly with the number of classes in an application. Here, we propose reformulated architectures whose training time becomes independent from this number. Additionally, we introduce a concise and model-agnostic LRP implementation. We challenge the proposed architectures using synthetic background bias, and COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, an application that commonly presents background bias. The networks hindered background attention and shortcut learning, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art models on out-of-distribution test datasets. Representing a potentially massive training speed improvement over ISNet, the proposed architectures introduce LRP optimization into a gamut of applications that the original model cannot feasibly handle.</description>

      <title>MONAL: Model Autophagy Analysis for Modeling Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing significance of large models and their multi-modal variants in societal information processing has ignited debates on social safety and ethics. However, there exists a paucity of comprehensive analysis for: (i) the interactions between human and artificial intelligence systems, and (ii) understanding and addressing the associated limitations. To bridge this gap, we propose Model Autophagy Analysis (MONAL) for large models' self-consumption explanation. MONAL employs two distinct autophagous loops (referred to as ``self-consumption loops'') to elucidate the suppression of human-generated information in the exchange between human and AI systems. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets, we evaluate the capacities of generated models as both creators and disseminators of information. Our key findings reveal (i) A progressive prevalence of model-generated synthetic information over time within training datasets compared to human-generated information; (ii) The discernible tendency of large models, when acting as information transmitters across multiple iterations, to selectively modify or prioritize specific contents; and (iii) The potential for a reduction in the diversity of socially or human-generated information, leading to bottlenecks in the performance enhancement of large models and confining them to local optima.</description>

      <title>UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Fair Feature Selection in Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the universal adoption of machine learning in healthcare, the potential for the automation of societal biases to further exacerbate health disparities poses a significant risk. We explore algorithmic fairness from the perspective of feature selection. Traditional feature selection methods identify features for better decision making by removing resource-intensive, correlated, or non-relevant features but overlook how these factors may differ across subgroups. To counter these issues, we evaluate a fair feature selection method that considers equal importance to all demographic groups. We jointly considered a fairness metric and an error metric within the feature selection process to ensure a balance between minimizing both bias and global classification error. We tested our approach on three publicly available healthcare datasets. On all three datasets, we observed improvements in fairness metrics coupled with a minimal degradation of balanced accuracy. Our approach addresses both distributive and procedural fairness within the fair machine learning context.</description>
