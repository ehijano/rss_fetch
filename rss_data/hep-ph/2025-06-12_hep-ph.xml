      <title>Equivalence of two component spinor mechanism and four component spinor mechanism in top quark pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the $S$-matrix elements for the process $e^{+} e^{-}\rightarrow t \bar{t}$ mediated by SM photon, $Z$ boson and an additional $Z^{'}$ boson indicating the contribution from new physics. We calculate the amplitude square using two component spinor formalism and four component spinor formalism and show the equivalance of the results using the two formalisms. We also establish the relations between the couplings of $Z^{'}$ boson to fermions in the two component spinor formalism and in the four component spinor formalism.</description>

      <title>The Primakoff effect: axion-photon mixing in the context of axion electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this work the study of the production of axions in stellar plasma medium through an external magnetic field. In the background field approximation, we can show that the presence of the external magnetic field induces a mixing between the photon and the axion, i.e. the so called Primakoff effect. Since the axion is one of the greatest candidates for dark matter, for being a neutral pseudo-scalar field, the Primakoff process constitutes a mechanism (or portal) to access the dark sector, which in turn provides us new perspectives beyond the standard model. In the high energies limit, observables like probabilities transitions and particles production rates were computed.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators: A Journey From Theory to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collider experiments offer a unique opportunity to explore the Standard Model (SM), and to search for new physics, new interactions, and new principles of nature. The theoretical abstraction of a collider, namely the study of correlations in asymptotic fluxes, provides one of the most basic examples of an observable in quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum gravity. Energy flux is described in QFT by energy flow operators, a particular example of light-ray operators. In addition to their central role in the theoretical description of collider physics, energy flow operators play an important role in diverse areas of formal QFT and gravity, providing a connection between real world collider phenomenology, and the deep underlying principles of QFT.
  Recently it has become possible to measure correlation functions of energy flow operators in a wide variety of collider experiments, providing an exciting new connection between collider physics and formal theory. In this review, we provide a survey of recent progress in our understanding of energy operators and their correlators, highlighting their importance in both formal theory and collider phenomenology, and in particular, their great potential for bridging these areas to provide new ways to understand the real world. We intend this article as a resource for both formal theorists interested in understanding how light-ray operators are being applied in particle and nuclear physics, as well as for experimentalists interested in the theoretical motivation for these observables. Most importantly, we aim to stimulate further interaction between the formal, phenomenological and experimental communities through the common lens of energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Precision $e^+e^-$ Hemisphere Masses in the Dijet Region with Power Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive high-precision results for the $e^+e^-$ heavy jet mass (HJM) $d \sigma/d \rho$ and dihemisphere mass (DHM) $d^2\sigma/(d s_1 d s_2)$ distributions, for $s_1\sim s_2$, in the dijet region. New results include: i) the N$^3$LL resummation for HJM of large logarithms $\ln^n(\rho)$ at small $\rho$ including the exact two-loop non-global hemisphere soft function, the 4-loop cusp anomalous dimension and the 3-loop hard and jet functions, ii) N$^3$LL results for DHM with resummation of logarithms $\ln(s_{1,2}/Q^2)$ when there is no large separation between $s_1$ and $s_2$, iii) profile functions for HJM to give results simultaneously valid in the peak and tail regions, iv) a complete two-dimensional basis of non-perturbative functions which can be used for double differential observables, that are needed for both HJM and DHM in the peak region, and v) an implementation of renormalon subtractions for large-angle soft radiation to ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ together with a resummation of the additional large $\ln(Q\rho/\Lambda_{QCD})$ logarithms. Here $Q$ is the $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energy. Our resummation results are combined with known fixed-order ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ results and we discuss the convergence and remaining perturbative uncertainty in the cross section. We also prove that, at order $1/Q$, the first moment of the HJM distribution involves an additional non-perturbative parameter compared to the power correction that shifts the tail of the spectrum (where $1\gg \rho\gg \Lambda_{QCD}/Q$). This differs from thrust where a single non-perturbative parameter at order $1/Q$ describes both the first moment and the tail, and it disfavors models of power corrections employing a single non-perturbative parameter, such as the low-scale effective coupling model. In this paper we focus only on the dijet region, not the far-tail distribution for $\rho \gtrsim 0.2$.</description>

      <title>Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an "Ultra Violet"$-$"Dark"$-$"Infra Red" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Histories in Neutrino Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the diverse cosmological histories of a dark sector that is connected to the Standard Model (SM) via a Dirac sterile neutrino. The dark sector consists of a complex scalar and a Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a global $U(1)$ stabilizing symmetry. Assuming the dark sector has negligible initial abundance and is populated from reactions in the SM thermal plasma during the radiation era, we show that the cosmological histories of the dark sector fall into four qualitatively distinct scenarios, each one characterized by the strengths of the portal couplings involving the sterile neutrino mediator. By solving Boltzmann equations, both semi-analytically and numerically, we explore these thermal histories and transitions between them in detail, including the time evolution of the temperature of the dark sector and the number densities of its ingredients. We also discuss how these various histories may be probed by cosmology, direct detection, indirect detection, collider searches, and electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibals with Low-reheating Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freeze-in mechanism provides a compelling framework for dark matter (DM) production, particularly suited to scenarios involving feeble interactions with the Standard Model (SM). In this work, we highlight a possible interplay of a non-instantaneous reheating phase and dark sector self-interactions, specifically $2 \to 3$ and $3 \to 2$ cannibalization processes. As an example we study the freeze-in production of a complex scalar DM candidate stabilized by a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry permitting cubic self-couplings, enabling number-changing interactions that drive internal thermalization and significantly modify the dark sector number density and temperature evolution. We numerically solve the coupled Boltzmann equations for the DM number density and temperature alongside the evolving SM bath, accurately capturing the dynamics of a prolonged reheating epoch. Our analysis reveals a rich and distinctive phenomenology arising from the interplay between the Universe's thermal history, Higgs portal mediated production, and cannibalistic self-interactions. Compared to scenarios with instantaneous reheating or negligible self-interactions, our framework opens new viable regions in parameter space, particularly for light DM, potentially within reach of future probes.</description>

      <title>Does the existence of $f_0$ meson enlarge the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay probability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate a possible contribution of the two-pion system $f_0(500)$ wide resonance to the decay probability of the super rare decay $K^+ \to 3\pi^0 e^+ \nu$. We vary the width of the resonance from 0.01 MeV to 1000 MeV. We found that the contribution of the narrow resonance in a system of several final state particles into the decay probability is proportional to its width. However it never exceeds the value of the decay probability calculated on free final state particles neglecting the resonance contribution.</description>

      <title>Exotic multistrange-anticharm baryon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exotic baryon systems composed of anticharmed mesons and strange baryons using the extended local hidden gauge approach. By solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation with interaction kernels from vector meson exchange, we explore the formation of hadronic molecular states in sectors with strangeness $S = -1$, $-2$, $-3$ and $-4$. A bound state with a mass of 2888 MeV is found in the $S = -1$ sector with the channels $\bar{D}_s N, ~\bar{D} \Lambda, ~\bar{D} \Sigma$. In the $S = -2$ sector, a bound state appears at 3057 MeV with the channels $\bar{D}_s \Lambda, ~\bar{D} \Xi$. No bound states are generated in the $S = -3$ ($\bar{D}_s \Xi$) and in the $S=-4$ sector ($\bar{D}_s \Omega$) because the interaction is repulsive in both cases. We also investigate vector-baryon systems with $\bar{D}^*$ and $\bar{D}_s^*$ mesons, finding similar but more deeply bound states. The results show that bound exotic states are more likely when one or two strange quarks are present. These results highlight the strangeness dependence of the molecular formation mechanism and provide theoretical predictions that can guide future experimental searches for exotic multistrange-anticharm baryon systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Left-Right Breaking from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early universe can generate stochastic gravitational waves (GWs), offering a unique probe of high-scale particle physics. The Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which restores parity symmetry at high energies and naturally incorporates the seesaw mechanism, allows for such transitions -- particularly during the spontaneous breaking of $SU(2)_R \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L} \to SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. This initial step, though less studied, is both theoretically motivated and potentially observable via GWs. In this work, we investigate the GW signatures associated with this first-step phase transition in the minimal LRSM. Due to the complexity and dimensionality of its parameter space, traditional scanning approaches are computationally intensive and inefficient. To overcome this challenge, we employ a Machine Learning Scan (MLS) strategy, integrated with the high-precision three-dimensional effective field theory framework -- using PhaseTracer as an interface to DRalgo -- to efficiently identify phenomenologically viable regions of the parameter space. Through successive MLS iterations, we identify a parameter region that yields GW signals detectable at forthcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as BBO and DECIGO. Additionally, we analyse the evolution of the MLS-recommended parameter space across iterations and perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters in the model. Our findings underscore both the observational prospects of gravitational waves from LRSM phase transitions and the efficacy of machine learning techniques in probing complex beyond the Standard-Model landscapes.</description>

      <title>Searching for beyond-Standard-Model solar neutrino interactions using directional detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are a class of technologies that enable the full three-dimensional spatial reconstruction of ionisation tracks from nuclear and electron recoils in gas. Anticipating near-future 30 m$^3$-scale time projection chambers with MPGD-based readout, we forecast the sensitivity of such directionally-sensitive low-energy recoil detectors to neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model. We work in the framework of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs), and calculate the combined recoil energy-angle distributions of the electron recoil signal generated by solar neutrinos in atmospheric-pressure He:CF$_4$ gas. We estimate the expected exclusion limits that such an experiment could place on various NSI parameters, as well as the mass and coupling of a new light mediator that interacts with electrons and neutrinos. We find that with an achievable background reduction of around a factor of ten from current estimates for a 30 m$^3$ optical-readout detector using this gas mixture, sensitivity to NSI parameters would already approach Borexino's sensitivity. Directionality also allows for event-by-event neutrino energy reconstruction, which would provide a means to resolve some parameter degeneracies present in the modified neutrino cross section in this formalism. Our results strongly motivate the development of small-scale directionally-sensitive gas detectors for neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of Quarkonia: A Possible Probe of a Deconfined QCD matter in Heavy-ion Collisions at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of deconfined QCD matter on quarkonium spin alignment in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We estimate the spin alignment of charmonium ($J/\psi$, and $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), and $\Upsilon$(2S)) states by calculating the energy eigenvalues in a thermal rotating medium. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a medium-modified color-singlet potential considering the coupling of spin with vorticity and magnetic field. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of medium temperature, vorticity, magnetic field, and momentum-space anisotropy on the elements of the spin density matrix. Our findings reveal that vorticity increases the spin alignment, while the magnetic fields and anisotropy modify the observables in a state-dependent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of quarkonium spin alignment in an anisotropic magneto-vortical thermal medium, shedding light on spin transport phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have considered $J/\Psi$ is a normal charmonium meson, while $\Psi(2S)$ is a mixed hybrid charmonium meson. Similarly $\Upsilon(1S)$ and$\Upsilon(2S)$ are normal upsilon mesons, while $\Upsilon(3S)$ is a mixed hybrid upsilon meson. We discuss the differential rapidity cross sections for $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon(3S)$ production via p-p, and O-O collisions at proton-proton energy $\equiv \sqrt{s_{pp}}$= 5.44 TeV. The rapidity taken for the present study goes from y=-1 to 1.</description>

      <title>New resonances at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large QCD background, the tt spectroscopy is poorly doing at LHC with the exception of a toponium type candidate observed with high statistical significance by CMS. Our previous work offers an alternate interpretation of this narrow resonance as a Kaluza Klein graviton. For heavy scalars, following ATLAS, we describe how the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms could produce a dip rather than a bump in the mass distribution, which further complicates searches for scalar resonances. It seems that A(420) and H(650) resonances, indicated by other channels, as described in our previous work, start to be visible in the tt channel in RUN2 analyses presented by ATLAS and CMS. An NMSSM interpretation does not seem excluded, although the mass difference between these two resonances comes as a surprise. The KK graviton scenario is updated from our previous work, already offering promising discoveries at RUN3. This scenario also offers excellent prospects for producing new narrow resonances at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. The present note summarizes these arguments and describes available indications, complementing our collection of evidences for BSM resonances in view of electing a future collider.</description>

      <title>Improving the description of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions using the SACOT-$\chi$ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimuon production in deeply inelastic scattering between neutrinos and nuclei plays an important role in constraining the strange-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs). Here, we present a self-contained calculation of this process consisting of a next-to-leading order semi-inclusive charmed-hadron production in the SACOT-$\chi$ general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme, followed by a semi-leptonic decay of the charmed hadron. We find that invoking the SACOT-$\chi$ scheme introduces modifications up to $20 \, \%$ in comparison to our previous esimates, where only kinematic mass effects were considered through the slow-rescaling variable. We reiterate our earlier observation that the effective acceptance correction - typically used in global PDF fits as a simplifying approximation - depends on the perturbative order, PDFs, scales, and also on the treatment of heavy-quark effects. We find good agreement with the corresponding data from the NuTeV experiment.</description>

      <title>Hard bremsstrahlung for the production of prompt photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical calculation of helicity amplitudes for hard photon and gluon bremsstrahlung radiation are described using the spinor formalism for processes of the type $\bar{q} q \to g \gamma$ and $q g \to q \gamma$. The presented amplitudes are expressed in terms of field strength bivectors, with allowance for the dependence on the helicities and masses of all particles. Numerical calculations have been performed for the quark-antiquark annihilation process $\bar{c}c$ at the center-of-mass energies of 24, 91, and 500 GeV, considering various combinations of helicities of the quarks and the photon in the final state. This study is part of the ongoing development of theoretical support, based on the SANC system, for the analysis of polarized observables in proton collisions at the NICA collider.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji: Ultralight Dark Matter versus Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is an attractive candidate for cold dark matter, one of the main mysterious components of the Universe. Recent studies suggest that gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers can also detect bosonic ULDM fields, which would produce monochromatic signals resembling those from gravitational waves (GWs). Distinguishing between these potential origins therefore would be essential. In this work, we develop a method to address this challenge for space-based GW interferometers (such as LISA and Taiji) by utilizing the null-response channel (NRC) in interferometric combinations, a channel constructed to have zero response to a specific type of source from a given direction. We find that while the GW NRC remains blind to GWs from a specific direction, it still responds to ULDM, particularly at frequencies above the interferometer's critical frequency. The ULDM NRC exhibits similar behavior. Based on these observations, we outline a test procedure to discriminate between signal origins. Our method provides a new diagnostic tool for analyzing monochromatic signals in space-based GW interferometers, potentially expanding the scientific scope of future missions.</description>

      <title>Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes and $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <title>Inclusive open charm photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC with G$\gamma$A-FONLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive $D^{0}$ production cross section in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC as a function of the $D^{0}$ transverse momentum and rapidity. These calculations are carried out within the new G$\gamma$A-FONLL (Generalized Photon-Nucleus FONLL) framework, which can predict photonuclear cross sections for charm and beauty hadrons in electron-proton, electron-nucleus, and ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. The framework relies on FONLL (Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm) to model heavy-quark production in photonuclear collisions and employs a photon-flux reweighting procedure to describe the production cross sections in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. The G$\gamma$A calculations are first validated against the photoproduction cross sections of $D^{*}$ in electron-proton collisions at HERA. The predictions for the $D^{0}$ production cross section in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC are then presented and compared to the first experimental results obtained by CMS at $\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV. The predictions are benchmarked against different choices of nuclear parton distribution functions, fragmentation functions, and renormalization and factorization scales.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaling entropy in charged hadron multiplicity distributions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the scaling behavior of the entropy associated with the charged hadron multiplicity distribution P(N) in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the growth of this entropic indicator as a function of the Bjorken x variable exhibits a universal behavior, consistent with observations from deep inelastic scattering (DIS). This universality suggests that the entropy scaling is a property of the initial state and reflects the diffusive nature of gluon dynamics at small x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-multiplicity events are not accurately described by traditional KNO scaling and require a more precise description based on a diffusion scaling framework. This new scaling emerges naturally from the universal growth of partonic entropy and offers a deeper insight into the dynamics of particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Laurent expansion of rational functions using p-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for reconstructing Laurent expansion of rational functions using $p$-adic numbers. By evaluating the rational functions in $p$-adic fields rather than finite fields, it is possible to probe the expansion coefficients simultaneously, enabling their reconstruction from a single set of evaluations. Compared with the reconstruction of the full expression, constructing the Laurent expansion to the first few orders significantly reduces the required computational resources. Our method can handle expansions with respect to more than one variables simultaneously. Among possible applications, we anticipate that our method can be used to simplify the integration-by-parts reduction of Feynman integrals in cutting-edge calculations.</description>

      <title>The geometric bookkeeping guide to Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on three improvements in the context of Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations: Firstly, we show that with a specific choice of prefactors, we trivialise the $\varepsilon$-dependence of the integration-by-parts identities. Secondly, we observe that with a specific choice of order relation in the Laporta algorithm, we directly obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equation on the maximal cut is in Laurent polynomial form with respect to $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a particular filtration. Thirdly, we prove that such a differential equation can always be transformed to an $\varepsilon$-factorised form. This provides a systematic algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for any Feynman integral. Furthermore, the choices for the prefactors and the order relation significantly improve the efficiency of the reduction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron star mergers: prospects for unique identification using multi-wavelength signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can result in the formation of long-lived magnetar remnants which can enhance neutrino and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In this work, we study the resulting multi-wavelength EM emissions and the prospects of their detectability in the current and upcoming EM telescopes. We model the pulsar-wind neubla system where the long-lived pulsar with dipolar magnetic fields of $10^{13} - 10^{15}$ G (magnetar) spins down and is surrounded by an outward expanding nebula and kilonova ejecta. Although at early times post the merger, the EM signatures are unobservable due to heavy attenuation, they become observable on timescales of $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ days after the merger. We find that the survey and follow-up observations have horizon distances $\gtrsim 1\ \rm Gpc$ for most of the wavebands and conclude that the detection prospects for such long-lived remnants in the electromagnetic channel are promising. This is of crucial importance for multi-messenger observations from BNS mergers to constrain the physical parameters of the remnants. Furthermore, we highlight how observations across the electromagnetic band can uniquely identify magnetar-powered transients resulting from BNS mergers and establish concrete associations of the detected gravitational wave signatures with such transients.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ and $\eta'$ meson production in $J/\psi$ radiative decays from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the computation of amplitudes describing the radiative decay processes $J/\psi \to \gamma \, \eta$ and $J/\psi \to \gamma \, \eta'$ from first principles via lattice QCD. Using lattices with two degenerate flavors of light quark and a heavier strange quark where $m_\pi \sim 391$ MeV, we compute three-point correlation functions using optimized meson operators with a range of momenta. The use of optimized operators allows access to the $\eta'$, even though it appears as an excited state, lying above the ground-state $\eta$ in the isoscalar pseudoscalar channel. Statistically precise signals are obtained in this disconnected process by averaging over large numbers of kinematically equivalent correlators. We determine transition form-factors as a function of photon virtuality across the timelike region, which describe also the 'Dalitz' processes $J/\psi \to e^+ e^- \, \eta^{(\prime)}$. Significantly lower magnitudes of transition form-factor for both the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are found than those extracted from experimental data, and possible explanations for this observation are presented.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ and $\eta'$ production in $J/\psi$ radiative decays from quantum chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first principles calculation within quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of the radiative decays of the $J/\psi$ into the light pseudoscalar mesons $\eta$ and $\eta'$. Within a lattice computation we obtain the transition form-factors as a function of photon virtuality from the timelike region, accessible experimentally via the 'Dalitz' decay $J/\psi \to e^+ e^-\, \eta^{(\prime)} $, through to the real photon point corresponding to $J/\psi \to \gamma\, \eta^{(\prime)} $. This is the first calculation in lattice QCD with two (heavier than physical) degenerate flavors of light quark and a heavier strange quark, in which the $\eta'$ appears as the first-excited state with pseudoscalar isoscalar quantum numbers. We access it reliably by using variationally optimized operators, use of which also improves the purity of the $J/\psi$ and $\eta$ signals, reducing systematic uncertainties. High quality results at a large number of kinematic points are obtained in a typically noisy disconnected process by using a novel correlator averaging procedure. Our results show the expected enhanced production of the $\eta'$ over the $\eta$ in this process, and suggest that the demonstrated lattice technology is suitable for future calculations considering processes in which light meson resonances are produced.</description>

      <title>Holography for QCD(Adj) and QCD(Adj)+F</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in SU(Nc) gauge theories with fermions in the adjoint representation. There has been considerable work on studying these theories compactified on a small circle (with compactification scale 1/L large relative to the strong coupling scale of the theory). The weakly coupled IR theory of photons exhibits confinement through a density of magnetically charged instanton configurations. As the compactification scale 1/L approaches the strong coupling scale, the IR theory becomes strongly coupled. In this regime we propose a holographic description of the IR degrees of freedom. The instanton condensation scale can be associated with a scale at which the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is violated in the model and the glueball spectrum computed. We can also introduce the adjoint fermions which holographically display a BF bound violation associated to their running anomalous dimension. Very naively extending the perturbative results to the non-perturbative regime suggests that chiral symmetry breaking might occur ahead of confinement, but equally they may be joined phenomena. If the two phenomena are separate, then it would be useful to be able to enlarge the gap in scales. We propose adding fermions in the fundamental representation as well, which in a holographic model (that favours this separation) can greatly enlarge the gap to an order of magnitude. These results challenge the lattice community to seek such scale gaps (or their absence) to further understand the confining and chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.</description>

      <title>QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</description>

      <title>A new approach to quark mass determination using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine quark masses using ratios of the vacuum-expectation values (VEVs) of flowed quark bilinear operators. They can be expressed as functions of the flow time $t$ and the ${\overline {\rm MS}}$ quark mass $\overline{m}$, which can then be determined by matching with the corresponding lattice results. Motivated by this, we evaluate these VEVs perturbatively through next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We provide the results as expansions in the limits of small and large $\overline{m}^2 t$. To this end, we develop a new expansion technique based on the Laplace transform. Additionally, we present numerical results with the exact mass dependence over a wide range of $\overline{m}^2t$. We discuss the expected perturbative precision for the mass determination based on our next-to-leading order perturbative calculations, and possible non-perturbative corrections.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sometimes a local minimum is known to be a metastable vacuum inside the low-energy EFT, but the true vacuum lies outside, and the bounce solution mediating the decay cannot be found. For single-field decay, Espinosa has proposed a family of configurations called ``pseudo-bounces'' as a way to constrain the decay rate. They are parametrized by the central field value $\Phi_0$ and constructed without the knowledge of the true vacuum. We prove that the pseudo-bounce family has a monotonically decreasing decay exponent whose end point and minimum is the bounce action, and this continues to hold when gravitational effects are non-negligible. We then use this to estimate the decay rate (in the radion direction) of the promised AdS$_3$ vacuum of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Partial Rate Matrix for Dark Matter Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and a parameter which describes their interactions. In addition, fitting our analytical results on lattice data, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <title>Higgs couplings in SMEFT via Zh production at the HL-LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Higgs couplings involved in the $Zh$ associated production mode at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in presence of Higgs-gauge boson coupling modifiers via $\kappa$ framework, and dimension 6 Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT) operators. The analysis is performed mainly in context of the HL-LHC (with $\sqrt{s}=$14 TeV and luminosity 3000 $fb^{-1}$) setup using cut based as well as machine learning techniques. The analysis shows significant betterment in the signal significance by using the machine learning technique. We also do a $\chi^2$ analysis, which reveals an appreciable change in the sensitivity of the coupling modifiers due to the presence of effective operators, in particular due to the $qqZh$ Higgs-current interactions. The dipole operators concerning the same vertex, combine quarks of different chiralities and does not interfere with the SM diagrams, hence contributing only at $\mathcal{O} (\Lambda^{-4})$. In order to observe better sensitivity for this class of operators, we need to move to higher center-of-mass energy, where the effects of both Higgs-current and dipole 4-point interactions are more prominent.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics to the hadron resonance gas at finite baryon, strangeness, and electric charge densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through model-to-data comparisons from heavy-ion collisions, it has been shown that the Quark Gluon Plasma has an extremely small shear viscosity at vanishing densities. At large baryon densities, significantly less is known about the nature of the shear viscosity from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Within heavy-ion collisions, there are three conserved charges: baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). Here we calculate the shear viscosity in two limits using perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas at finite BSQ densities. We then develop a framework that interpolates between these two limits such that shear viscosity is possible to calculate across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. We find that the pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence such that a rather non-trivial shear viscosity appears at finite densities.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>

Abstract: Parametrization of cascading hadronic reactions is a central tool in hadron spectroscopy for modeling matrix elements and extracting parameters of hadronic states. Implementing the helicity formalism consistently presents challenges, particularly for particles with spin, due to the need to match spin states of final-state particles, an operation known as the Wigner rotation. This paper discusses these challenges in detail and offers solutions, including a practical method for implementation. Equipped with a general algorithm for computing Wigner rotations, we extend the studies to alternative amplitude formulations, the minus-phi and canonical conventions.</description>

      <title>New Angles on Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales as $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of $M^2 \log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this improved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions, and higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge theories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive visualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for different jet samples. We propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behavior.</description>

Abstract: The decay $H \to ZZ \to 4\ell$, with $\ell = e,\mu$, can be used to test quantum interference in analogy to the famous double-slit experiment. The observations corresponding to `covering a slit' can be extracted from data in the $ee\mu\mu$ channel, while the observations when both `slits' are open, which include the interference, are measured in the $4e/4\mu$ channels. In this way, this process offers a unique opportunity to investigate identical-particle effects at high energies, and provide the first evidence of identical-particle behaviour for muons. Sensitivity at the $4\sigma$ level could be achieved at the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) may appear in the form of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). We have studied neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in presence of NSI. We obtain that in this scenario, nucleon matrix elements depend not only on the isovector axial nucleon form factor but also on the isoscalar one. For the axial form factors we consequently rely on the quark flavor decomposition performed by QCD simulations in the lattice (LQCD). We have examined cross sections and polarization observables. For the current bounds on diagonal muon flavor NSI couplings we find substantial deviations from the SM predictions in cross sections and transverse polarizations of the outgoing nucleons. In view of the progress in the precision of LQCD determinations of nucleon properties, modern measurements of neutral current (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering will be in the position to discover or significantly constrain NSI.</description>

Abstract: We show the first use of generative transformers for generating calorimeter showers as point clouds in a high-granularity calorimeter. Using the tokenizer and generative part of the OmniJet-${\alpha}$ model, we represent the hits in the detector as sequences of integers. This model allows variable-length sequences, which means that it supports realistic shower development and does not need to be conditioned on the number of hits. Since the tokenization represents the showers as point clouds, the model learns the geometry of the showers without being restricted to any particular voxel grid.</description>

      <title>Conformal Freeze-in Dark Matter: 5D Dual and Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal Freeze-in (COFI) scenario postulates a dark sector described by a conformal field theory (CFT) at energies above the ``gap scale" in the keV$-$MeV range. At the gap scale, the dark CFT undergoes confinement, and one of the resulting bound states is identified as the dark matter candidate. In this paper, we study this model in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence with a focus on the mechanism of the infrared (IR) breaking of conformal invariance in the dark sector. We construct the holographic dual to the conformal dark sector, given by a Randall-Sundrum-like model in 5D, where the Standard Model (SM) fields and the dark matter candidate are placed on the ultraviolet (UV) and IR branes respectively. The separation between the UV and IR branes is stabilized by a bulk scalar field, naturally generating a hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the gap scale. We find that the parameter space of COFI comprises two distinct branches of CFT's living on the Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) boundary, each corresponding to a different UV boundary condition. The two branches of CFT's result in different radion potentials. The confinement of the CFT is dual to the spontaneous symmetry breaking by the 5D radion potential. We then use this dual 5D setup to study the cosmological confining phase transition in the dark sector. We find the viable parameter space of the theory which allows the phase transition to complete promptly without significant supercooling.</description>

      <title>NNPDFpol2.0: a global determination of polarised PDFs and their uncertainties at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NNPDFpol2.0, a new set of collinear helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton based on legacy measurements of structure functions in inclusive neutral-current longitudinally polarised deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and of W -boson, single-inclusive, and di-jet production asymmetries in longitudinally polarised proton-proton collisions. The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Generic two-loop results for trilinear and quartic scalar self-interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the shape of the Higgs potential realised in Nature is a central part of the physics programme at the LHC and future colliders. In this context, accurate theoretical predictions for trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present results that enable significant progress in the automation of these calculations at the two-loop level in a wide range of models. Specifically, we calculate the generic two-loop corrections for scalar n-point functions with n&lt;=4 assuming that all external scalars are identical. Working in the zero-momentum approximation, we express the results in terms of generic couplings and masses. Additionally, by exploiting permutation invariances, we reduce the number of Feynman diagrams appearing to a substantially smaller set of basis diagrams. To ease the application of our setup, we also provide routines that allow to map our generic results to scalar two-loop amplitudes generated with the package FeynArts. We perform a series of calculations to cross-check our results with existing results in the literature. Moreover, we present new two-loop results for the trilinear Higgs coupling in the general singlet extension of the Standard Model. We also present the public Python package Tintegrals, which allows for fast and stable evaluations of all relevant two-loop integrals with vanishing external momenta.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves and Laboratory Searches as Complementary Probes of Right-handed Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses in the range $0.1$-$10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. Additionally we use LIGO data to put upper bounds on the reheating temperature after inflation, for a given blue-tilted GW spectrum. We find complementarity between GW signals and laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$-$2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.</description>

Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Sea quark-gluon effect on the magnetic octupole deformation of decuplet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic octupole moment of $J^P= \frac{3}{2}^+$ decuplet baryons are discussed in the statistical framework, treating baryons as an ensembles of quark-gluon Fock states. The probabilities associated with multiple strange and non-strange Fock states depict the importance of sea in spin, flavor $\&amp;$ color space, which are further merged into statistical parameters. The individual contribution of valence and sea (scalar, vector and tensor) to the magnetic octupole moment is calculated. The symmetry breaking in both sea and valence is experienced by a suppression factor $k(1-C_l)^{n-1}$ and a mass correction parameter 'r', respectively. The factor $k(1-C_l)^{n-1}$ systematically reduces the probabilities of Fock states containing multiple strange quark pairs. The octupole moment value is obtained -ve for $\Delta^{++}, \Delta^+, \Sigma^{*+}$ and +ve for $\Delta^{-}, \Sigma^{*-}, \Xi^{*-}, \Omega^-$ baryons with the domination of scalar (spin-0) sea. The computed results are compared with existing theoretical predictions, demonstrating good consistency. These predictions may serve as valuable inputs for future high-precision experiments and theoretical explorations in hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Pion-Nucleon Scattering in Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory combined with the ${ 1/N_c}$ Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work implements the combined BChPT and 1/Nc expansions for pion-nucleon elastic scattering. The effective theory is based on the baryon sector dynamical spin-flavor SU(4) symmetry emergent in the large Nc limit, whose breaking is controlled by the $1/N_c$ expansion. The non-commutativity of the chiral and 1/Nc expansions in unitarity corrections (loops) requires a linking of both expansions. As it was shown in the case of baryon masses and currents, the natural linking is the $\xi$-expansion, in which $O(p) = O(1/Nc ) = O(\xi)A$. The spin-flavor symmetry requires that the ground state baryons span an SU(4) symmetric irreducible representation which implies that in particular $N$ and $\Delta$ are active degrees of freedom in the effective theory. The scattering amplitude is expanded to the next-to-next-to leading order in the $\xi$ expansion, corresponding to the one-loop contributions with the LO Lagrangian. The results are given for generic $N_c$ in order to demonstrate the consistency of the framework. The spin-flavor symmetry plays a central role in maintaining the consistency of the effective theory with respect to the $1/N_c$ expansion. This consistency manifests itself in an improvement in the convergence of the low energy expansion with respect to the case of the ordinary BChPT without an explicit dynamical $\Delta$, which is known to be inconsistent with the constraints of $N_c$ scaling. Fits to the $\pi N \to \pi N$ S, P and D partial wave amplitudes from the SAID data base are finally used to test the framework and to determine the energy range of its applicability.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two classes of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources are presented. The asymptotic regime is extracted, with attention to quasilocal gravitational energy, shear and angular momentum related by the Raychaudhuri equation. At outer boundaries the quasilocal angular momentum and energy densities vanish, defining novel geometric structures - the vortex surface and the rotosurface. Solutions with a rotosurface present a new notion of asymptotic flatness: vorticity, shear and Kretschmann scalars vanish at a finite radial distance from the symmetry centre. Synthetic rotation curves for the Milky Way are presented, fit to GAIA-DR3 data, and potential astrophysical signatures are suggested. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Standard Model is accompanied by a new pseudo-scalar degree of freedom, $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson, which cancels the topological susceptibility of the electroweak vacuum and gets its mass from this effect. The prediction is based on the analyticity properties of the Chern-Simons correlator combined with the basic features of gravity. Depending on the quality level of the $U(1)_{B+L}$-symmetry, $\eta_{\rm w}$ emerges as a $B+L$ pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a St\"uckelberg $2$-form of the electroweak gauge redundancy. An intriguing scenario of the first category is the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ in the form of the phase of a $U(1)_{B+L}$-violating fermion condensate triggered by the instantons, somewhat similar to $\eta'$-meson in QCD. Regardless of its origin, the presence of $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson in the theory appears to be a matter of consistency.</description>

Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}$=0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

Abstract: Some recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large-scale structure of the Universe imply cosmic parity violation. Among possible parity-violating sources, helical primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are of particular interest, as they inherently violate parity symmetry and can explain the observed magnetic fields, especially in void regions. PMFs, if generated in the early universe, can source curvature perturbations, which evolve into the present density fluctuations observed in CMB and galaxy surveys. Motivated by this, we study the imprint of helical PMFs on the trispectrum of the sourced primordial curvature perturbations, which is a leading-order scalar statistics sensitive to parity-violating signals. We derive full expressions for the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations sourced by both the helical and non-helical PMFs and reduce them to computationally-feasible ones using a proper approximation. From numerical works, we confirm that parity-odd signals are efficiently enhanced and surpass parity-even ones in specific momentum and parameter spaces. Parity-violating signatures found in this paper are partially testable with observational implications reported so far. Assuming nearly scale-invariant PMF power spectra and the PMF strength of $B_{r}=4.7 \, {\rm nG}$, we obtain a rough upper bound on the helical-to-non-helical power ratio as $r_H\lesssim 4\times 10^{-4}$. Our findings highlight the primordial trispectrum as a promising probe of helical PMFs and provide a theoretical basis for future precise observations of higher-order statistics in the CMB anisotropies and the galaxy clustering.</description>
