      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Non-Hermitian Spectral Topology in Hyperbolic Lattices with Non-Abelian Translation Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic lattice (HBL) has emerged as a compelling platform for exploring matter in non-Euclidean space. Among its notable features, the breakdown of the conventional Bloch theorem stands out, prompting a reexamination of band theory, with the determination of spectra for non-Hermitian systems being a prominent example. Here, we develop an approach to determining the spectra under open boundary conditions (OBCs), one of the foundations in non-Hermitian lattices, from the reciprocal space of HBLs. By introducing supercells to encompass states that are allowed by non-Abelian translational groups, we perform analytic continuation and base on the point gap topology to acquire uniform spectra, the universal OBC spectral range. Applying this method to a single-band nonreciprocal model and a reciprocal non-Abelian semimetal model, we reveal higher-dimensional skin effects and topological phase transitions, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of our method in predicting spectral topology and investigating non-Hermitian physics in HBLs.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Electro-Optic Modulators based on Epsilon-Near-Zero Materials: Comparing the Classical Drift-Diffusion and Schr\"odinger-Poisson Coupling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design, modeling, and optimization of high-performance plasmonic electro-optic modulators leveraging voltage-gated carrier density in indium tin oxide (ITO) where the gated carrier density is modeled using both the Classical Drift-Diffusion (CDD) and Schr\"odinger-Poisson Coupling (SPC) methods. The latter ensures a more detailed and precise description of carrier distributions under various gate voltages which gains particular significance when applied to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) medium such as ITO. Combining the nanoscale confinement and field enhancement enabled by surface plasmon polaritons with the ENZ effect in ITO, modulator designs integrated with silicon waveguides and optimized for operation at {\lambda}0 = 1550 nm achieve a 3-dB bandwidth of 210 GHz, an insertion loss of 3 dB, and an extinction ratio of 5 dB for an overall length of &lt; 4 {\mu}m as predicted by the SPC model. Our results illustrate trade-offs between high-speed modulator operation and low insertion loss, vs. extinction ratio, and the need for precise modelling of carrier distributions in ENZ materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal coherent states in an infinite array of boson sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regular coherent state (CS) is a special type of quantum state for boson particles placed in a single site. The defining feature of the CS is that it is an eigenmode of the annihilation operator. The construction easily generalizes to the case of a finite number of sites. However, the challenge is altogether different when one considers an infinite array of sites. In this work we demonstrate a mathematically rigorous construction that resolves the latter case. The resulting nonlocal coherent states (NCS) are simultaneous eigenmodes for all of the infinitely many annihilation operators acting in the infinite array's Fock space. Our construction fundamentally relies on Dirichlet series-based analysis and number theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse. The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>
