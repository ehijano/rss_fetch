      <title>Speeding up deferred acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A run of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm may contain proposals that are sure to be rejected. We introduce the accelerated deferred acceptance algorithm that proceeds in a similar manner to DA but with sure-to-be rejected proposals ruled out. Accelerated deferred acceptance outputs the same stable matching as DA but does so more efficiently: it terminates in weakly fewer rounds, requires weakly fewer proposals, and final pairs match no later. Computational experiments show that these efficiency savings can be strict.</description>

      <title>Strictly Proper Scoring Mechanisms Without Expected Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When eliciting forecasts from a group of experts, it is important to reward predictions so that market participants are incentivized to tell the truth. Existing mechanisms partially accomplish this but remain susceptible to groups of experts colluding to increase their expected reward, meaning that no aggregation of predictions can be fully trusted to represent the true beliefs of forecasters. This paper presents two novel scoring mechanisms which elicit truthful forecasts from any group of experts, even if they can collude or access each other's predictions. The key insight of this approach is a randomization component which maintains strict properness but prevents experts from coordinating dishonest reports in advance. These mechanisms are strictly proper and do not admit expected arbitrage, resolving an open question in the field.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Game Dynamics Applied to Strategic Adoption of Immersive Technologies in Cultural Heritage and Tourism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive technologies such as Metaverse, AR, and VR are at a crossroads, with many actors pondering their adoption and potential sectors interested in integration. The cultural and tourism industries are particularly impacted, facing significant pressure to make decisions that could shape their future landscapes. Stakeholders' perceptions play a crucial role in this process, influencing the speed and extent of technology adoption. As immersive technologies promise to revolutionize experiences, stakeholders in these fields weigh the benefits and challenges of embracing such innovations. The current choices will likely determine the trajectory of cultural preservation and tourism enhancement, potentially transforming how we engage with history, art, and travel. Starting from a decomposition of stakeholders' perceptions into principal components using Q-methodology, this article employs an evolutionary game model to attempt to map possible scenarios and highlight potential decision-making trajectories. The proposed approach highlights how evolutionary dynamics lead to identifying a dominant long-term strategy that emerges from the complex system of coexistence among various stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Reforms meet fairness concerns in school and college admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many matching systems around the world have been reformed. These reforms responded to objections that the matching mechanisms in use were unfair and manipulable. Surprisingly, the mechanisms remained unfair even after the reforms: the new mechanisms may induce an outcome with a blocking student who desires and deserves a school which she did not receive. However, as we show in this paper, the reforms introduced matching mechanisms which are more fair compared to the counterfactuals. First, most of the reforms introduced mechanisms that are more fair by stability: whenever the old mechanism does not have a blocking student, the new mechanism does not have a blocking student either. Second, some reforms introduced mechanisms that are more fair by counting: the old mechanism always has at least as many blocking students as the new mechanism. These findings give a novel rationale to the reforms and complement the recent literature showing that the same reforms have introduced less manipulable matching mechanisms. We further show that the fairness and manipulability of the mechanisms are strongly logically related.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Fair Rank-Minimizing Mechanisms with Agent Refusal Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines strategic issues in fair rank-minimizing mechanisms, which choose an assignment that minimizes the average rank of object types to which agents are assigned and satisfy a fairness property called equal treatment of equals. As one of these fair mechanisms, the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is considered. We focus on the case where agents can refuse their assignment and obtain the outside option instead. Without the refusal option, truth-telling is not strategically dominated by any strategies if a fair rank-minimizing mechanism is used. However, if agents have the option and the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is used, then a strategy called an outside option demotion strategy strategically dominates truth-telling. Moreover, we show that adopting this strategy may lead to inefficient assignments. To counter this, we propose a modification of the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism, though it may lead agents to strategically reduce the number of acceptable types.</description>

      <title>How to Make an Action Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two actions in a decision problem, a and b, each of which that produces a state-dependent monetary reward, we study how to robustly make action a more attractive. Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at which a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is preferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in money). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications in politics, bilateral trade and insurance.</description>
