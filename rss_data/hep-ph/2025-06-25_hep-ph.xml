      <title>IBIS: Inverse BInomial sum Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In higher-loop calculations, Mellin-Barnes representations are used to simplify the denominators encountered in Feynman parameter integrals. The contour integral of these representations yield sums over residues. We extend the classes of such sums that can be calculated, to include those involving inverse binomials. Our results are expressed in terms of so-called $S$-sums, where the dependence on the upper limit of the sum is analytic. This is accomplished by deriving several new recursion relations, obtained from telescoping series and repeated synchronization. We make our results available through IBIS ("Inverse BInomial sum Solver"), a FORM program to perform such inverse binomial sums. It expresses them in terms of $S$-sums, which can be handled by XSUMMER. To illustrate the efficiency of our code: sums up to weight 6 can be carried out in less than a second. We show in an example how inverse binomial sums arise, though in many instances these are nested with binomial sums, beyond the cases studied here. Our work thus provides a starting point for studying such sums, that will open up new avenues in higher-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>First High-Throughput Evaluation of Dark Matter Detector Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first high-throughput search and evaluation of materials that can serve as excellent low-mass dark matter detectors. Using properties of close to one thousand materials from the Materials Project database, we project the sensitivity in dark matter parameter space for experiments constructed from each material, including both absorption and scattering processes between dark matter and electrons. Using the anisotropic materials in the dataset, we further compute the level of daily modulation in interaction rates and the resulting directional sensitivities, highlighting materials with prospects to detect the dark matter wind. Our methods provide the basic tools for the data-driven design of dark matter detectors, and our findings lay the groundwork for the next generation of highly optimized direct searches for dark matter as light as the keV scale.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Road through Dark$\nu$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Domain Walls from Super-Cooling First Order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion is a well-motivated hypothetical particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) and a compelling dark matter candidate. Its relic abundance is highly sensitive to the thermal history of the universe when the temperature is around the QCD confinement scale. Meanwhile, the NANOGrav Collaboration has reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background, which could originate from a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) with a nucleation temperature around the O(MeV-GeV) scale. We explore how such an FOPT might alter the evolution of the QCD axion. Our findings suggest that it could induce the axion to go through a short stage of mini kinetic misalignment. Moreover, in some parameter regime, the formation of QCD axion domain walls becomes generically expected. This has intriguing implications for both the existence of the QCD axion and the FOPT interpretation of the NANOGrav signal.</description>

      <title>Graph theory inspired anomaly detection at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing model-independent anomaly detection algorithms for analyzing LHC data remains a central challenge in the search for new physics, due to the high dimensionality of collider events. In this work, we develop a graph autoencoder as an unsupervised, model-agnostic tool for anomaly detection, using the LHC Olympics dataset as a benchmark. By representing jet constituents as a graph, we introduce a method to systematically control the information available to the model through sparse graph constructions that serve as physically motivated inductive biases. Specifically, (1) we construct graph autoencoders based on locally rigid Laman graphs and globally rigid unique graphs, and (2) we explore the clustering of jet constituents into subjets to interpolate between high- and low-level input representations. We obtain the best performance, measured in terms of the Significance Improvement Characteristic curve for an intermediate level of subjet clustering and certain sparse unique graph constructions. We further investigate the role of graph connectivity in jet classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging graph-theoretic insights to refine and increase the interpretability of machine learning tools for collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutral and Charged Current Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering at NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (SIDIS) provides important probes of parton distributions and fragmentation functions. We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) massless QCD corrections to the full set of SIDIS coefficient functions in analytical form, accounting for electroweak neutral current and charged current exchange. Focusing on the kinematical setting of SIDIS measurements at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we quantify the impact of these corrections on the phenomenological predictions and their associated uncertainties. We investigate the impact of electroweak interference in the neutral current SIDIS process and investigate lepton polarisation asymmetries designed to enhance the sensitivity on charged current SIDIS.</description>

      <title>Heavy scalar molecule $B_{c}^{+} B_{c}^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass and full width of the heavy scalar molecule $\mathcal{M}$ composed of the mesons $B_{c}^{+}$ and $B_{c}^{-}$ are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. To find its mass and current coupling we apply the two-point sum rule method. The width of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M} =B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$ is evaluated by taking into account its dissociation to $\eta_c\eta_{b}, J/\psi \Upsilon$, and $ B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-} $ mesons. Decays into $D$ and $B$ meson pairs with appropriate charges and quantum numbers triggered by $\overline{b}b$ and $ \overline{c}c$ annihilations to light quark-antiquarks are also included into analysis. Because the partial widths of $\mathcal{M}$ molecule's decay channels depend on the strong couplings at $\mathcal{M}$-meson-meson vertices, we estimate them by invoking tools of the three-point sum rule method. Our predictions $m=(12725 \pm 85)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{ M}]=(155 \pm 23)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ for the parameters of the molecule $\mathcal{ M}$ provide useful information for experimental studies of numerous heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Quantum Observables in $h\to WW^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay $h \to WW^* \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \ell'^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell'}$ provides a unique window into the structure of the Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and has recently gained attention for its potential to unveil quantum properties such as quantum entanglement between the intermediate gauge bosons. In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. Despite the impact of these higher-order effects, the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under higher-order corrections compared to the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay, better preserving the underlying two-qutrit quantum structure.</description>

      <title>WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which were formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may be in existence today and become a candidate for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via Hawking radiation of PBHs, and survived PBHs via the memory burden effect. In addition, feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are considered as an alternative to WIMPs. Various similar studies have been conducted either with or without considering the memory burden effect. In this study, we simultaneously account for thermally produced WIMPs or FIMPs and the memory burden effect of PBHs to explain the relic abundance of DM. We show that this abundance is highly sensitive to the memory burden effect in PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Standard Model fit to electroweak precision observables in using the latest data and the Particle Data Group (PDG) measurement of the W boson mass. The analysis is then repeated in light of the new W boson mass measurement from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration. We then introduce a dark photon to the model, placing constraints on the parameter space arising from these electroweak precision observables, both for the PDG and CDF values for the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.</description>

      <title>Mono-Higgs signature in a singlet fermionic dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark matter in association with a Higgs boson at the LHC within the singlet fermionic dark matter model. We focus on final states featuring a Higgs boson accompanied by large missing transverse momentum ($E^{\textrm{miss}}_{\textrm{T}}$), where the Higgs decays into a $b \bar{b}$ pair in the ATLAS analysis and into a $ZZ$ pair in the CMS analysis. Assuming light dark matter fermions with a mass of approximately 1 GeV, we find that the predicted production yields in this model are compatible with, or even exceed, those of the benchmark scenarios studied in the recent experimental analyses, particularly in the low $E^{\textrm{miss}}_{\textrm{T}}$ region, under parameter sets allowed by current collider bounds and dark matter constraints. Therefore, we expect that some exclusion limits on the model parameters introduced in this work may be derived from existing ATLAS and CMS mono-Higgs search results, and that the mono-Higgs production in this model can be directly probed at the future High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE together with the Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model (DCPC) to study the $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ production in $pp$ collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, in line with the LHCb observation of $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ in the $B^{-}\to D^{-}D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$ decays in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV [PRL 134(2025)101901]. The final hadronic states of the $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are first simulated by the PACIAE model. Three sets of $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ candidates are then recombined by the DCPC model using the constituent meson pair of $D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$, $D^{+}K^{-}$, and $D^{-}K^{+}$ based on the above simulated final hadronic states, respectively. We calculate their rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and angular distribution between the two component mesons, as well as angular distribution between $D$ component meson and $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$. Our results show that the yields of three $T_{cs0}^{*}(2870)^{0}$ candidates follow the magnitude order of $D^{+}K^{-}$ $&gt;$ $D^{-}K^{+}$ $\sim$ $D^{0}K^{0}_{S}$ (the latter two are nearly equal indeed). Similar ordering behavior is also observed in the aforementioned distributions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling dark Higgs mechanism via dark photon production at an e^+ e^- collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the phenomenology study of dark photon, its mass origin is usually not considered. But in the theory construction, its mass is often generated via a dark Higgs mechanism, which predicts a dark Higgs particle. In this work, we study the impact of such a light (non-decoupled) dark Higgs particle in the collider detection of the dark photon. Assuming both the dark photon and dark Higgs decay invisibly, the search for dark photon via its photon-associated production would be affected by the dark Higgs emission from the dark photon. To examine this effect, for the dark photon and dark Higgs not too light, the hard scattering process with one dark Higgs in the final-state is taken as the leading-order correction; while for their masses much lower than the collision energy, merging is performed in the dark sector to deal with infrared divergence. We find that the dark Higgs emission can affect the signal cross section and the kinematic variables such as the invisible mass. We recast the analysis from the BaBar collaboration and obtain a new exclusion limit for the invisible dark photon.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of anomalous magnetic moment in a low energy effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) are investigated in a 2-flavor low-energy effective theory within the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach under an external magnetic field. The Schwinger formalism is adopted for quark propagators, and Fierz-complete four-quark scatterings are self-consistently included through the renormalization group flows. We find that the quark AMMs are dynamically generated with the chiral symmetry breaking, and the magnitude of the AMM of the down quark is around 4 times larger than that of the up quark. The transverse AMMs and the longitudinal d-quark AMM monotonically decrease with the magnetic field strength, while the longitudinal u-quark AMM slightly increases with the magnetic field strength. At $B=0$, the magnetic moments of proton and neutron are computed using the constituent quark model, which are close to the experimental values.</description>

      <title>Investigating New Physics through the Observables of Semileptonic $B_{s}\to K^{\ast}(\to K \pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare four-fold decay $B_s \to K^*(\to K\pi)\mu^+\mu^- $, governed by the flavor-changing neutral current transition $b \to d\mu^+\mu^-$, provides a sensitive probe for testing the Standard Model (SM) and investigating signatures of new physics (NP). This work presents a comprehensive model-independent analysis of the decay using the framework of the weak effective field theory. We compute a set of key physical observables, including the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fraction, and several normalized angular coefficients $\langle I_i\rangle$, as a function of the dilepton invariant mass squared $q^2$. The impact of NP is explored via both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) scenarios involving NP Wilson coefficients $C_7^{\text{NP}}$, $C_9^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$, and $C_{10}^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$. Our findings reveal notable deviations from the SM predictions across multiple observables. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between different observables and their 2D contour plots which would be useful to further constrain the parametric space of possible NP contributions. This study reinforces the potential of $B_s \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay as a complementary channel in the search for physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Analytic formulation of Leptogenesis with neutrino oscillation data employing the general parametrization for neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry, unexplained by the Standard Model (SM), can both be accounted for by extending the SM to include Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Tiny neutrino masses naturally arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, which involves lepton number violation. Meanwhile, the baryon asymmetry can be generated via leptogenesis, where the out-of-equilibrium decay of RHNs produces a lepton asymmetry that is partially converted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The Dirac Yukawa couplings play the crucial role for both Type-I seesaw and leptogenesis. In this work, we derive an analytic expression for the CP asymmetry parameter in a general parametrization. Focusing on a hierarchical RHN mass spectrum, we evaluate the lowest mass of the lightest RHN that reproduce both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. We study the case with two and three generations of RHNs for both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios. Besides the standard Type-I seesaw involving SM Higgs doublet, we also examine the Type-I seesaw with a new neutrinophillic Higgs doublet. In this case for non-thermal leptogenesis, the minimum value for the lightest RHN mass can be as low as sphaleron decoupling temperature.</description>

      <title>Extracting the kinetic freeze-out properties of high energy pp collisions at the LHC with event shape classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event shape measurements are crucial for understanding the underlying event and multiple-parton interactions (MPIs) in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions. In this paper, the Tsallis Blast-Wave model with independent non-extensive parameters for mesons and baryons, was applied to analyze transverse momentum spectra of charged pions, kaons, and protons in pp collision events at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV classified by event shape estimators relative transverse event activity, spherocity, and flattenicity. Our analysis indicates that the transverse momentum spectra with different event shapes can be well described by this model. Events exhibiting higher activity or a greater degree of angular isotropy consistently show stronger radial flow and smaller non-extensive parameters across different event shape classifiers, reflecting the increasing role of soft quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. Compared to the charged multiplicity classified events for pp collisions and PbPb collisions, a universal scaling in the kinetic freeze-out temperature and non-extensive parameter across all collision system types and event shape measurements is observed, suggesting a unified partonic evolution stage governed by similar QCD dynamics. It has been shown that the introduction of event-shape observables in pp collisions has significantly expanded the accessible freeze-out parameter space, enabling a more comprehensive exploration of its boundaries. Among the event shape classifiers, flattenicity emerges as a unique observable for disentangling hard process contributions from additive MPI effects, allowing the isolation of collective motion effects encoded by the radial flow velocity. Through the analysis of the interplay between event-shape measurements and kinetic freeze-out properties, we gain deeper insights into the mechanisms responsible for flow-like signatures in pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Rank-Preserving Index-Dependent Matrix Transformations: Applications to Clockwork and Deconstruction Theory Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09033v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile framework of index-dependent element-wise matrix transformations, $b_{ij} = a_{ij} / g_f(i,j)$, with direct applications to hierarchy generating mass hierarchies in high-energy physics. This paper establishes the precise mathematical conditions on $g_f(i,j)$ that preserve the rank and nullity of the original matrix. Our study reveals that such transformations provide a powerful method for engineering specific properties of a matrix's null space; by appropriately selecting the function $g_f(i,j)$, one can generate null vectors (or eigenvectors) with diverse and controllable localization patterns. The broad applicability of this technique is discussed, with detailed examples drawn from high-energy physics. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to tailor 0-mode profiles and fermionic mass spectra in clockwork and dimensional deconstruction models, showing that the standard clockwork mechanism arises as a particular case $(g_f(i,j) = f^{(i-j)})$, thereby offering new tools for particle physics BSM model building. This work illustrates the potential of these transformations in model building across various fields where localized modes or specific spectral properties are crucial.</description>

      <title>Not-quite-primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo "direct collapse" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincar\'e patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincar\'e patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.</description>

      <title>New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consists of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165-240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consists of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195-325~nm and 123-200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the full ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $1.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Multi-Dimensional Integration with Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm that performs Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling (QAIS) for Monte Carlo integration of multidimensional functions, targeting in particular the computational challenges of high-energy physics. In this domain, the fundamental ingredients for theoretical predictions such as multiloop Feynman diagrams and the phase-space require evaluating high-dimensional integrals that are computationally demanding due to divergences and complex mathematical structures. The established method of Adaptive Importance Sampling, as implemented in tools like VEGAS, uses a grid-based approach that is iteratively refined in a separable way, per dimension. This separable approach efficiently suppresses the exponentially growing grid-handling computational cost, but also introduces performance drawbacks whenever strong inter-variable correlations are present. To utilize sampling resources more efficiently, QAIS exploits the exponentially large Hilbert space of a Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC) to manipulate a non-separable Probability Density Function (PDF) defined on a multidimensional grid. In this setting, entanglement within the PQC captures the correlations and intricacies of the target integrand's structure. Then, the PQC strategically allocates samples across the multidimensional grid, focusing the samples in the small subspace where the important structures of the target integrand lie, and thus generates very precise integral estimations. As an application, we look at a very sharply peaked loop Feynman integral and at multi-modal benchmark integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis investigates effective field and string theories in which supersymmetry is realized and broken in various ways. Chapter 1 addresses effective theories with nonlinearly realized supersymmetry, constructed using the formalism of constrained superfields. We establish a criterion for identifying inconsistent constraints, formulate their improved versions, and propose, along these lines, improved supergravity models of inflation. In Chapter 2, we discuss a peculiar application of this framework: the gravitational production of massive gravitinos in time-dependent backgrounds. We emphasize some physical subtleties in the standard description of this mechanism, which become particularly severe in the case of the gravitino. Next, the focus shifts to linear supersymmetry, and we investigate the leading-order coupling of the massive spin-2 field supermultiplet to pure supergravity in four dimensions. This analysis is carried out using the supercurrent superfield formalism, and it shows that only a single class of such couplings can be consistently defined. This is fundamentally distinct from the coupling obtained by compactifying higher-dimensional supergravities, and it has interesting connections to string theory and the string lamppost principle. Finally, in Chapter 3, we present a novel orientifold projection of type IIB string theory. This is a Scherk--Schwarz orientifold in which supersymmetry is entirely broken, and the O-planes couple only to the twisted sector of the theory. We argue that this model is invariant under S-duality and can be formulated as an F-theory compactification. We also analyze the D-brane spectrum of the theory and compare the results with earlier similar constructions. All original findings presented in this thesis are preceded by a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the general frameworks to which they belong.</description>

Abstract: We present the first lattice simulations of the nonlinear evolution after axion inflation by self-consistently incorporating currents arising from Schwinger pair production. The tachyonically amplified gauge fields trigger the growth of Schwinger currents, leading to universal values for the conductivity and magnetic field at the onset of strong backreaction and subsequent quenching of gauge field production. We show that the Schwinger effect (prematurely) saturates gauge field production, thereby diminishing the prospects of axion inflation magnetogenesis as a viable solution for blazar observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>

Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves (GWs) sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. This approach, however, does not reveal how these two contributions are distributed in this scenario. Meanwhile, the dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral GWs around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that captures the characteristics of the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis. With this approach, we try to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we observe that spin-2 nature seems to make the level-crossing inefficient, indicating that the chrial charge is likely to accumulate in the vacuum. On this basis, phenomenological implications for gravitational leptogenesis are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Special relativity allows massless particles to have states of different integer (or half-integer) helicities that mix under boosts, much like the spin-states of a massive particle. Such massless particles are known as continuous spin particles (CSPs), a term coined by Wigner, and they are notable for their infinite tower of spin polarizations. The mixing under boosts is controlled by a spin-scale $\rho$ with units of momentum. Normally, we assume $\rho=0$. The interactions of CSPs are known to satisfy certain simple properties, one of which is that the $\rho \rightarrow 0$ limit generically recovers familiar interactions of massless scalars, photons, or gravitons, with all other polarizations decoupling in this limit. Thus, one can ask if the photon of the Standard Model is a CSP at small but non-zero $\rho$. One concern about this possibility -- originally raised by Wigner -- is that the infinite tower of polarizations could pose problems for thermodynamics. To address this question, we study the thermal evolution of a CSP photon gas coupled to isothermal matter, across CSP helicity modes and phase space. We find that the structure of the interactions dictated by Lorentz symmetry imply well behaved thermodynamics. When the CSP photon's interactions to charged matter are turned on, the primary $h=\pm 1$ helicity modes thermalize quickly, while the other modes require increasingly long time-scales to thermalize, set by powers of $T/\rho$. In familiar thermal systems, the CSP photon behaves like the QED photon with small $\rho$- and time- dependent corrections to its effective relativistic degrees of freedom. Sizable departures from familiar thermal behavior arise at energy scales comparable to $\rho$ and could have testable experimental consequences.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Model of Heavy Vector Singlets for the LHC and Future Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a simplified model of two colourless heavy vector resonances in the singlet representation of $SU(2)_{L}$, with zero and unit hypercharge. We discuss mixing with the Standard Model gauge bosons due to electroweak symmetry breaking, semi-analytic formulae for production at proton colliders, requirements to obey the narrow width approximation and selected low energy constraints. We show current LHC constraints and sensitivity projections for the HL-LHC, HE-LHC, SPPC and FCC-hh on the charged and neutral heavy vectors. The utility of the simplified model Lagrangian is demonstrated by matching these results onto three explicit models: a weakly coupled abelian extension of the Standard Model gauge group, a weakly coupled non-abelian extension and a strongly coupled minimal composite Higgs model. All our results are presented in terms of physical resonance masses, using expressions which are accurate even at vector masses near the electroweak scale due to a parameter inversion we derive. We discuss the importance of this inversion and point out that its effect, and the effects of electroweak symmetry breaking, can remain important up to resonance masses of several TeV. Finally, we clarify the relation between this simplified model and the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) model, a simplified model for heavy $SU(2)_{L}$ triplets with zero hypercharge, and provide exact and approximate matching relations.</description>

      <title>Approximate magic symmetry in a cobimaximal scenario of Majorana neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The searches for an underlying pattern in neutrino masses have motivated different proposals for textures in the neutrino mass matrix, which is also related to particular arrangements of the mixing matrix. Current experimental determinations of neutrino mixings have restricted some of the most studied proposals. In this work, we propose a new combined constraint on the neutrino mass matrix arising from the cobimaximal mixing and the magic symmetry in a model-independent fashion. We show that both conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in an exact but rather in an approximate way. We have found that the Majorana CP phases are tightly restricted within this approach, leading to well-defined regions in the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude. The small symmetry breaking requirement allows us to determine the Majorana phases for specific values of the lightest neutrino mass, consistent with current bounds on the mixing angles, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and cosmology results.</description>

Abstract: By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, possible hadronic molecules in the $D^*\bar K$-$D\bar K^*$ coupled-channel system are investigated with the one-meson exchange potentials, where both vector and pseudoscalar mesons are considered as exchange particles. We find an S-wave virtual state with mass $M=2487$ MeV, and a resonance with $M=2759$ and width $\Gamma=18$ MeV. In the $D^* \bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears as a cusp at the $D^*\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially manifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\bar K \pi$ three-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay width for $\bar K^*$.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gluon polarization contribution to the spin alignment of vector mesons from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of vector mesons $\rho$, $\phi$, and $J/\Psi$ in both non-rotating and rotating thermal media using the soft-wall holographic QCD model with four flavours. By incorporating anisotropic backgrounds derived from the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton action, we incorporate rotational effects via a $U(1)$ gauge field, and the induced polarization of gluons is described by a rotation dependent dilation field. Spectral function analysis reveals that $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons exhibit broad peaks at lower temperatures, indicating their presence in the medium, while these peaks disappear at higher temperatures. Rotation delays this melting process, increasing the dissociation temperature. In contrast, the $J/\Psi$ meson, owing to its heavy charm quark content, demonstrating its resilience to thermal effects. We further explore the global spin alignment of these mesons in the event plane frame. For the $\phi$ meson, the averaged $\rho_{00}$ over the full range of azimuthal angle shows weak temperature dependence at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) but significant suppression at high $p_T$, aligning with experimental observations. Rotation enhances $\rho_{00}$ at high $p_T$, a phenomenon attributed to angular momentum transfer via spin-orbit coupling. The $J/\Psi$ meson, however, displays insensitivity to temperature and rotation up to $p_T=5$ GeV, with a very small suppression observed at higher $p_T$, likely due to its heavy quark nature. Although $\rho$ meson spin alignment is not yet experimentally measured, it exhibits behaviour qualitatively similar to the $\phi$ meson, with thermal fluctuations dampening alignment and rotation enhancing it.</description>

Abstract: Implementing the axion concept in the context of 3-3-1 extensions of the Standard Model (SM) leads to richer properties than in the simpler axion setups, and related to the Dirac neutrino seesaw mechanism. In this way the smallness of neutrino masses, the strong CP problem, the nature of dark matter and the number of families all have a common origin. Besides having an enhanced coupling to photons, our revamped axion can also be distinguished from DFSZ and KSVZ axions through its couplings to fermions. The latter lead to interesting phenomenological consequences, including flavor-changing axion-emitting two-body K, B and D meson decays.</description>

Abstract: Exclusive $J/\psi$ production is investigated in proton-proton collisions employing GPD approach with GK model. Three
  sets gluon density are used to calculate exclusive $J/\psi$ production. The survival factors and equivalent photon approximation
  are applied to predict the exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton collisions. The GPD method prediction gives a good
  agreement with the experimental data at LHCb.
  The exclusive $J/\psi$ production is given in proton-proton collisions at RHIC and NICA.
  These predictions of GPD approach can be employed to estimate the exclusive $J/\psi$ cross sections
  in future proton-proton collisions.</description>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and serves as the cornerstone of modern physics, supporting the constancy of the speed of light. A crucial implication of this principle is that no particle can propagate faster than this universal speed limit. In this study, we present a stringent neutrino-based test of Lorentz invariance, utilizing the highest-energy neutrino ever detected, known as event KM3-230213A. The detection of this neutrino, with measured energy of approximately 220 PeV, allows us to establish a lower bound on the scale of second-order Lorentz invariance violation, quantified as \(\Lambda_2&gt;5.0\times 10^{19}\) GeV at 90 \% confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on superradiant instabilities caused by an ultralight scalar field around spinning black holes (BHs). When the scalar couples to neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction, thermal corrections from the C$\nu$B induce a quartic self-interaction and an effective mass term for the scalar. We show that, for Yukawa couplings as small as $y_{\phi \nu} \sim 10^{-16}$ (for astrophysical BHs) or $10^{-20}$ (for supermassive BHs), the quartic term can quench the instability and set observable bounds, even if the scalar does not constitute dark matter. We assess the robustness of these constraints against several sources of uncertainty, including gravitational focusing of relic neutrinos, galactic clustering, and non-linear backreaction. An enhanced local neutrino density weakens the bounds by up to an order of magnitude compared to a uniform background, yet the induced self-interaction remains strong enough to significantly affect the superradiant dynamics. Our results open a new observational window on neutrino-coupled scalars via BH superradiance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore vector dark matter (DM) production in the early Universe focusing on a scenario with a low reheating temperature. One can achieve low reheat temperature in many ways, for example, by considering a longer lifetime of the inflaton field. We analyze the impact of various model parameters on DM production, including gauge coupling and reheat temperature, while incorporating all relevant constraints from DM relic density, collider bounds, and DM direct and indirect detection experiments. Our results reveal a strong correlation between DM mass and reheat temperature, with viable parameter space requiring $T_R/M_{W_D} \sim 0.1$. While DM production from decays is generally subdominant, we identify a regime where freeze-in production from decay is dominant due to the phase space suppression. For DM masses below 100 GeV, production is primarily driven by SM fermions, whereas higher masses come due to the Higgses annihilation. The enhanced coupling strength in our framework enables potential detection in direct and indirect detection and collider experiments. The direct detection experiments have already explored some parts of the region and future DARWIN will explore the further region whereas for indirect detection, the detection prospects for the present case are futile. We found that a very narrow region of the parameter space has been explored by the DM direct detection contrary to the WIMP DM case where most of the parameter space has been ruled out.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum Information Theory of Hadronization: Dihadron Fragmentation and Neutral Polarization in Heavy Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Production mechanism of hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}s}$ with strangeness $S=-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hidden-charm pentaquark states with strangeness $S=-1$ ($P_{c\bar{c}s}$) within an off-shell coupled-channel approach based on effective Lagrangians that respect heavy-quark spin symmetry, SU(3) flavor symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. All relevant meson-baryon two-body channels composed of low-lying anti-charmed mesons and singly-charmed baryons with $S=-1$, as well as the $J/\psi \Lambda$ channel, are included. We find a total of eleven negative-parity states and three positive-parity states. Among the negative-parity states, the $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)$ can possibly be interpreted as $\bar{D}\Xi_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ molecular states, respectively. We identify a second state, $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4472)$, located close to the $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)$ but with different spin and width, which may correspond to the structure observed by the Belle Collaboration. Both states are generated from the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ channel and can be interpreted as spin partners. Their properties are consistent with recent experimental observations, providing strong support for the molecular interpretation of the $P_{c\bar{c}s}$ states. We also observe a two-pole structure near the $\bar{D}_s^* \Lambda_c$ and $\bar{D}\Xi_c^{'}$ thresholds, and find virtual and resonance states in the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_{c}^{'}$ channel depending on spin-parity.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations of $B \to A$ form factors with higher-twist corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) approach, the next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are calculated with the twist-two and twist-three $B$ meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) at leading power in $\Lambda / m_b$. At one-loop level, the vacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation functions defined with interpolating currents for the $p$-wave axial-vector meson are factorized into short-distance coefficients and the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of the $B$ meson, among which the hard coefficients for A0-type currents and $\mu$ dependent jet functions entering correlation functions $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$, $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\delta\mu,\perp}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ are identical to the corresponding ones of $B \to V$ in SCET. In addition, $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(V-A)}$ and $\Pi_{\mu,\|}^{(T+\tilde{T})}$ coincide with the results of $B\to \pi,K$ under the limit $m_q \to 0$ up to one-loop accuracy. Then the subleading power corrections to $B \to A$ form factors are computed with the higher-twist $B$ meson LCDAs at tree level up to the twist-six accuracy. Furthermore, we predict the $q^2$ dependence of $B \to A$ form factors via the Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) $z$-series expanding parameterization to compute several physical observables including branching ratios of semileptonic $B\to A \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ and $B\to A \nu_{\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} $ processes, transverse asymmetries, forward-backward asymmetries and lepton flavor universality observables employing the given mixing angles $\theta_K=-34^\circ$, $\theta_{1_{P_1}}=28^\circ$, $\theta_{3_{P_1}}=23^\circ$. We also compare our theory calculations with the results from other methods.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HB$\chi$PT), a non-relativistic effective field theory that treats baryons as heavy static sources, to calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of spin-3/2 baryons in two sectors: the light-flavor decuplet baryons and singly heavy sextet baryons. We derive the analytical expressions up to $\mathcal{O}\left(p^3\right)$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections provide substantial contributions to the polarizabilities. In addition, magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the baryons can significantly affect the magnetic polarizabilities and may even reverse their signs. For the decuplet baryons, the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^0$ exhibit the largest electric polarizabilities. Their values, $\alpha_E(\Delta^+) = (17.4 \pm 9.5)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(\Delta^0) = (16.9 \pm 9.2)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$, significantly exceed those typically observed for nucleons. Meanwhile, the electric polarizabilities of spin-3/2 singly heavy baryons are comparable to those of their spin-1/2 partners.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) remains a critical challenge in designing and interpreting experiments aimed at discovering neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Here, we identify a class of observables, distinct from those employed in low-energy nuclear structure applications, that are strongly correlated with the NMEs: momentum correlations among hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. Focusing on the $^{150}$Nd$\rightarrow$$^{150}$Sm transition, we combine a Bayesian analysis of the structure of $^{150}$Nd with simulations of high-energy $^{150}$Nd+$^{150}$Nd collisions. We reveal prominent correlations between the NMEs and features of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these processes, such as spatial gradients and anisotropies, which are accessible via collective flow measurements. Our findings demonstrate collider experiments involving $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay candidates as a platform for benchmarking theoretical predictions of the NMEs.</description>

      <title>Projective Imaging of High-Energy Nuclei via Coherent Exclusive Vector Meson Production in Electron-Nucleus Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of modern nuclear experiments is to study the distributions of gluons inside nuclei at high energy. A key measurement is the coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive electron-nucleus collisions, where the gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the squared nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution. This research aims to overcome the two main obstacles of the $|t|$ measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$ arising from the momentum resolution of the outgoing electron and the overwhelming incoherent background. We demonstrate that by measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution along the direction perpendicular to the electron scattering plane, the effect of the outgoing electron's momentum resolution can be effectively mitigated, and the diffractive pattern is largely restored. Furthermore, we propose to measure the angular distribution of the VM's decay daughters to statistically remove the incoherent background.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

Abstract: Fermionic dark matter absorption on nuclear targets via neutral current interactions is explored using a non-relativistic effective field theory framework. An analysis of data from the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ bubble chamber sets leading constraints on spin-independent absorption for dark matter masses below 23 MeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and establishes the first limits on spin-dependent absorptive interactions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of bubble chambers to low-mass dark matter and underscore the importance of absorption searches in expanding the parameter space of direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>
