      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Quantifying Nonlinear Uncertainty Propagation in Eddy Identification Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean eddies are swirling mesoscale features that play a fundamental role in oceanic transport and mixing. Eddy identification relies on diagnostic criteria that are inherently nonlinear functions of the flow variables. However, estimating the ocean flow field is subject to uncertainty due to its turbulent nature and the use of sparse and noisy observations. This uncertainty interacts with nonlinear diagnostics, complicating its quantification and limiting the accuracy of eddy identification. In this paper, an analytically tractable mathematical and computational framework for studying eddy identification is developed. It aims to address how uncertainty interacts with the nonlinearity in the eddy diagnostics and how the uncertainty in the eddy diagnostics is reduced when additional information from observations is incorporated. The framework employs a simple stochastic model for the flow field that mimics turbulent dynamics, allowing closed-form solutions for assessing uncertainty in eddy statistics. It also leverages a nonlinear, yet analytically tractable, data assimilation scheme to incorporate observations, facilitating the study of uncertainty reduction in eddy identification, which is quantified rigorously using information theory. Applied to the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter, a widely used eddy diagnostic criterion, the framework leads to three key results. First, closed formulae reveal inhomogeneous spatial patterns in the OW uncertainty despite homogeneous flow field uncertainty. Second, it shows a close link between local minima of the OW expectation (eddy centers) and local maxima of its uncertainty. Third, it reveals a practical information barrier: the reduction in uncertainty in diagnostics asymptotically saturates, limiting the benefit of additional observations.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Urban Heat Mitigation: Attribution and Weighting of Multi-Scale Drivers</title>

Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forest regression (RFR) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RFR-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce uncertainties and test the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</description>
