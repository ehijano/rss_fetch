      <title>Single-SEM Schubert Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pattern-avoidance characterization of $w \in S_n$ such that the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w$ is a standard elementary monomial. This characterization tells us which quantum Schubert polynomials are easiest to compute. We solve a similar problem for complete homogeneous monomials.</description>

      <title>On the minimum Hamming distance between vectorial Boolean and affine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hamming distance between vectorial Boolean functions and affine functions. This parameter is known to be related to the non-linearity and differential uniformity of vectorial functions, while the calculation of it is in general difficult. In 2017, Liu, Mesnager and Chen conjectured an upper bound for this metric. We prove this bound for two classes of vectorial bent functions, obtained from finite quasigroups in characteristic two, and we improve the known bounds for two classes of monomial functions of differential uniformity two or four. For many of the known APN functions of dimension at most nine, we compute the exact distance to affine functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ be the maximum possible size of a point set in general position in the $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. In this note, we determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{3},p)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor by proving a balanced supersaturation result for the sets of $4$ points in the same plane.</description>

      <title>Tight upper bounds on the hop domination number of triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ is a {\it hop dominating set} of $G$ if every vertex not in $S$ has a $2$-step neighbor in $S$. The {\it hop domination number}, $\gamma_h(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a hop dominating set of $G$. In this paper, we show that for a connected triangle-free graph $G$ with $n\ge 15$ vertices, if $\delta(G)\ge 2$, then $\gamma_h(G)\le \frac{2n}{5}$, and the bound is tight. We also give some tight upper bounds on $\gamma_h(G)$ for {triangle-free} graphs $G$ that contain a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds in the Apex Minor Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $A$ is "apex" if $A-z$ is planar for some vertex $z\in V(A)$. Eppstein [Algorithmica, 2000] showed that for a minor-closed class $\mathcal{G}$, the graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ with bounded radius have bounded treewidth if and only if some apex graph is not in $\mathcal{G}$. In particular, for every apex graph $A$ and integer $r$, there is a minimum integer $g(A,r)$ such that every $A$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has treewidth at most $g(A,r)$. We show that if $t=|V(A)|$ then $g(A,r)\in O^\ast(r^9t^{18})$ which is the first upper bound on $g(A,r)$ with polynomial dependence on both $r$ and $t$. More precisely, we show that every $A$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has no $16rt^2 \times 16rt^2$ grid minor, which implies the first result via the Polynomial Grid Minor Theorem. A key example of an apex graph is the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,t}$, since $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs include and generalise graphs embeddable in any fixed surface. In this case, we prove that every $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graph with radius $r$ has no $4r(1+\sqrt{t})\times 4r(1+\sqrt{t})$ grid minor, which is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>On posets and polytopes attached to arbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the data of an arbor, which is a rooted tree with vertices decorated by disjoint sets, we introduce a lattice polytope and a partial order on its lattice points. We give recursive algorithms for various classical invariants of these polytopes and posets, using the tree structure. For linear arbors, we propose a conjecture exchanging the Ehrhart polynomial of the polytope with the Zeta polynomial of the poset for the reverse arbor. The general motivation comes from the action of a transmutation operator acting on M -triangles, which should link the posets considered here with some kinds of generalized noncrossing partitions and generalized associahedra. We give some evidence for this relationship in several cases, including notably some polytopes, namely halohedra and Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>

      <title>Existence of Deadlock-Free Routing for Arbitrary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a network of routing nodes, represented as a directed graph, we prove the following necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of deadlock-free message routing: The directed graph must contain two edge-disjoint directed trees rooted at the same node, one tree directed into the root node and the other directed away from the root node.
  While the sufficiency of this condition is known, its necessity, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously recognized or proven. Although not directly applicable to the construction of deadlock-free routing schemes, this result provides a fundamental insight into the nature of deadlock-free networks and may lead to the development of improved tools for designing and verifying such schemes.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Given an integer partition of $n$ into distinct parts, the sum of the reciprocal parts is an example of an egyptian fraction. We study this statistic under the uniform measure on distinct parts partitions of $n$ and prove that, as $n \to \infty$, the sum of reciprocal parts is distributed away from its mean like a random harmonic sum.</description>

      <title>Cell closures for two-row Springer fibers via noncrossing matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Springer fibers are a family of subvarieties of the flag variety parametrized by nilpotent matrices that are important in geometric representation theory and whose geometry encodes deep combinatorics. Two-row Springer fibers, which correspond to nilpotent matrices with two Jordan blocks, also arise in knot theory, in part because their components are indexed by noncrossing matchings. Springer fibers are paved by affines by intersection with appropriately-chosen Schubert cells. In the two-row case, we provide an elementary description of these Springer Schubert cells in terms of standard noncrossing matchings and describe closure relations explicitly. To do this, we define an operation called cutting arcs in a matching, which successively unnests arcs while ``remembering" the arc originally on top. We then prove that the boundary of the Springer Schubert cell corresponding to a matching consists of the affine subsets of cells corresponding to all ways of cutting arcs in that matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs represent an interesting and historically important class of integral graphs. Since the pioneering work of Klotz and Sander, numerous incarnations of these graphs have been explored in the literature. In this article, we define and establish some foundational properties of gcd-graphs defined over a general finite commutative ring. In particular, we investigate the connectivity and diameter of these graphs. Additionally, when the ring is a finite symmetric $\mathbb{Z}/n$-algebra, we give an explicit description of their spectrum using the theory of Ramanujan sums that gives a unified treatment of various results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We use the automatic theorem prover Walnut to resolve various open problems from the OEIS and beyond. Specifically, we clarify the structure of sequence A260311, which concerns runs of sums of upper Wythoff numbers. We extend a result of Hajdu, Tijdeman, and Varga on polynomials with nonzero coefficients modulo a prime. Additionally, we settle open problems related to the anti-recurrence sequences A265389 and A299409, as well as the subsumfree sequences A026471 and A026475. Our findings also give rise to new open problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we mutuate the concept of Ducci matrices to the $p$-adic setting, generalizing the classical Ducci sequences to the framework of $p$-adic numbers. The classical Ducci operator, which iteratively computes the absolute differences of neighboring elements in a sequence or matrix, is redefined using the $p$-adic absolute value $| \cdot |_p$. We investigate the dynamics of $p$-adic Ducci sequences for matrices over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, focusing on their convergence and periodicity properties.</description>

Abstract: We calculate an explicit closed formula for the action of the height 2 full Morava stabilizer group on the coefficient ring of height 2 Morava E-theory. In particular, this yields an explicit, surprisingly simple closed formula for the action of the automorphism group of a height 2 formal group law on its Lubin-Tate deformation ring. The formula is of a combinatorial nature, given by sums over certain labelled ordered rooted trees.</description>

      <title>A Three-Regime Theorem for Flow-Firing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical chip-firing is a discrete dynamical system where chips are placed on the vertices of a graph and exchanged via simple firing moves. Recent work has sought to generalize chip-firing on graphs to higher dimensions, wherein graphs are replaced by cellular complexes and chip firing becomes flow-rerouting along the faces of the complex. Given such a system, it is natural to ask (1) whether this firing process terminates and (2) if it terminates uniquely (e.g. is confluent). In the graphical case, these questions were definitively answered by Bjorner--Lovasz--Shor, who developed three regimes which completely determine if a given system will terminate. Building on the work of Duval--Klivans--Martin and Felzenszwalb-Klivans, we answer these questions in a context called flow-firing, where the cellular complexes are 2-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Truncated degree DP-colourability of $K_{2,4}$-minor free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a graph and $k$ is a positive integer. Let $f$ from $V(G)$ to $ N$ be defined as $f(v)$ is the minimum of $k$ and $d(v)$. If $G$ is $f$-DP-colourable (respectively, $f$-choosable), then we say $G$ is $k$-truncated degree DP-colourable (respectively, $k$-truncated degree-choosable). Hutchinson proved that 2-connected maximal outerplanar graphs other than the triangle are $5$-truncated degree-choosable, and asked whether the result can be extended to all outerplanar graphs, and the question remained open.
  This paper proves that 2-connected $K24$-minor free graphs other than cycles and complete graphs are $5$-truncated degree DP-colourable. This not only answers Hutchinson's question in the affirmative, but also extends to a larger family of graphs, and strengthens choosability to DP-colourability.</description>

      <title>Outerplanar graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that all simple outerplanar graphs $G$ with minimum degree at least $2$ and positive Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature on every edge have maximum degree at most $9$. Furthermore, if $G$ is maximally outerplanar, then $G$ has at most $10$ vertices. Both upper bounds are sharp.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of amorphic schemes and fusions of pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An association scheme is called amorphic if every possible fusion of relations gives rise to a fusion scheme. We call a pair of relations fusing if fusing that pair gives rise to a fusion scheme. We define the fusing-relations graph on the set of relations, where a pair forms an edge if it fuses. We show that if the fusing-relations graph is connected but not a path, then the association scheme is amorphic. As a side result, we show that if an association scheme has at most one relation that is neither strongly regular of Latin square type nor strongly regular of negative Latin square type, then it is amorphic.</description>

      <title>When do the Kahn-Kalai Bounds Provide Nontrivial Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), bounds the critical probability, $p_c(\mathcal{F})$, of the a non-trivial property $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^X$ that is closed under supersets by the product of a universal constant $K$, the expectation threshold of the property, $q(\mathcal{F})$, and the logarithm of the size of the property's largest minimal element, $\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. That is, the Park-Pham theorem asserts that $p_c(\mathcal{F})\leq Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. Since the critical probability $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ always satisfies $p_c(\mathcal{F})&lt;1$, one may ask when the upper bound posed by Kahn and Kalai gives us more information than this--that is, when is it true that $Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F}) &lt; 1$? In this short note, we provide a number of necessary conditions for this to happen and give a few sufficient conditions for the bounds to provide new (and, in fact, asymptotically perfect) information along the way. In the most interesting case where $\ell(\mathcal{F}_n)\rightarrow \infty$, we prove the following relatively strong necessary condition for the Kahn-Kalai bounds to provide nontrivial information: For every positive integer $t$, every collection of all-but-$t$ of the minimal elements of $\mathcal{F}_n$ may have nonempty intersection for only finitely many $n$. Consequently, not only must the number of minimal elements become arbitrarily large, but so too must the size of any cover. Intuitively, this means that such sequences $\mathcal{F}_n$ must occupy an ever-widening `wedge' in $2^{X_n}$: the further $\mathcal{F}_n$ climbs up $2^{X_n}$ in one area, the further it must spread down and across $2^{X_n}$ in another.</description>

      <title>Modular Golomb rulers and almost difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda)$-difference set in a group $G$ of order $v$ is a subset $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots,d_k\}$ of $G$ such that $D=\sum d_i$ in the group ring ${\mathbb{Z}}[G]$ satisfies $$D D^{-1} = n + \lambda G,$$ where $n=k-\lambda$. In other words, the nonzero elements of $G$ all occur exactly $\lambda$ times as differences of elements in $D$.
  A $(v,k,\lambda,t)$-almost difference set has $t$ nonzero elements of $G$ occurring $\lambda$ times, and the other $v-1-t$ occurring $\lambda+1$ times. When $\lambda=0$, this is equivalent to a modular Golomb ruler. In this paper we investigate existence questions on these objects, and extend previous results constructing almost difference sets by adding or removing an element from a difference set. We also show for which primes the octic residues, with or without zero, form an almost difference set, correcting an error in the literature.</description>

      <title>Correlation between residual entropy and spanning tree entropy of ice-type models on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, normalised by the number of vertices, is known as the residual entropy in studies of ice-type models on graphs. The spanning tree entropy depends similarly on the number of spanning trees. We demonstrate and investigate a remarkably strong, though non-deterministic, correlation between these two entropies. This leads us to propose a new heuristic estimate for the residual entropy of regular graphs that performs much better than previous heuristics. We also study the expansion properties and residual entropy of random graphs with given degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980, Gupta, Kahn and Robertson proved that every graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k\geq 2$ contains a cycle $C$ containing at least $k+1$ vertices each having at least $k$ neighbors in $C$ (so $C$ has at least $\frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{2}$ chords). In this work, we go further by showing that some of its edges can be contracted to obtain a graph with high minimum degree (we call such a minor of $C$ a \emph{cyclic minor}). We then investigate further cycles having cliques as cyclic minors, and show that minimum degree at least $O(k^2)$ guarantees a cyclic $K_k$-minor.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of t(3,n) and s(3,n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of vertices $X\subseteq V$ in a simple graph $G(V,E)$ is irredundant if each vertex $x\in X$ is either isolated in the induced subgraph $G[X]$ or else has a private neighbor $y\in V\setminus X$ that is adjacent to $x$ and to no other vertex of $X$. The \emph{mixed Ramsey number} $t(m,n)$ is the smallest $N$ for which every red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ has an $m$-element irredundant set in the blue subgraph or an $n$-element independent set in the red subgraph. The irredundant Ramsey number $s(m,n)$ is the smallest $N$ for which every red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ has an $m$-element irredundant set in the blue subgraph or an $n$-element irredundant set in the blue subgraph. In this paper, we determine $t(3,n)$ and $s(3,n)$ up to a constant factor by showing that $t(3,n)=O\left(n^{5/4}/{\log{n}}\right)$, which improved the best upper bound due to Rousseau and Speed in [Comb. Probab. Comput. 12 (2003), 653-660]. As an application, we verify a conjecture for $m=4$ proposed by Chen, Hattingh, and Rousseau in [J. Graph Theory 17(2) (1993), 193-206].</description>

      <title>New recursion formula for the interior polynomial based on non-expanding sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interior polynomial was originally defined for hypergraphs and later shown to coincide with the Ehrhart polynomial of the root polytope of an associated bipartite graph. In previous work, we derived an alternating cycle recursion formula for the interior polynomial. Here, we introduce a new, more transparent recursion formula based on the structure of non-expanding sets. This formula offers a clearer combinatorial interpretation of the interior polynomial and its connection to polyhedral geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. An $n$-element subset $A$ of $K$ is a $B_h$-set if every element of $K$ has at most one representation as the sum of $h$ not necessarily distinct elements of $A$. Associated to the $B_h$ set $A = \{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}$ are the $B_h$-vectors $\mathbf{a} = (a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ in $K^n$. This paper proves that ``almost all'' $n$-element subsets of $K$ are $B_h$-sets in the sense that the set of all $B_h$-vectors is a dense open subset of $K^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the K\H{o}nig type property for non-simple polyominoes. We prove that, for closed path polyominoes, the polyomino ideals are of K\H{o}nig type, extending the results of Herzog and Hibi for simple thin polyominoes. As an application of this result, we give a combinatorial interpretation for the canonical module of the coordinate ring of a sub-class of closed path polyominoes, namely circle closed path polyominoes. In this case, we compute also the Cohen-Macaulay type and we show that $K[\mathcal{P}]$ is a level ring.</description>

      <title>On the Frobenius Number and Genus of a Collection of Semigroups Generalizing Repunit Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A=(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ be a sequence of relative prime positive integers with $a_i\geq 2$. The Frobenius number $F(A)$ is the largest integer not belonging to the numerical semigroup $\langle A\rangle$ generated by $A$. The genus $g(A)$ is the number of positive integer elements not in $\langle A\rangle$. The Frobenius problem is to determine $F(A)$ and $g(A)$ for a given sequence $A$. In this paper, we study the Frobenius problem of $A=\left(a,h_1a+b_1d,h_2a+b_2d,\ldots,h_ka+b_kd\right)$ with some restrictions. An innovation is that $d$ can be a negative integer. In particular, when $A=\left(a,ba+d,b^2a+\frac{b^2-1}{b-1}d,\ldots,b^ka+\frac{b^k-1}{b-1}d\right)$, we obtain formulas for $F(A)$ and $g(A)$ when $a\geq k-1-\frac{d-1}{b-1}$. Our formulas simplify further for some special cases, such as Mersenne, Thabit, and repunit numerical semigroups. Finally, we partially solve an open problem for the Proth numerical semigroup.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

Abstract: We introduce an operation on skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ called switching, and also define a class of skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ referred to as modular Eulerian matrices. We then show that these are closely related to the graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at $\ell$-th roots of unity. As an application, we study the point simplicial complexes of skew polynomial algebras at cube roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Exercises in Iterational Asymptotics II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear recurrences we consider here include the functions $3x(1-x)$ and $\cos(x)$, which possess attractive fixed points $2/3$ and $0.739...$ (Dottie's number). Detailed asymptotics for oscillatory convergence are found, starting with a 1960 paper by Wolfgang Thron. Another function, $x/(1+x\ln(1+x))$, gives rise to a sequence with monotonic convergence to $0$ but requires substantial work to calculate its associated constant $C$.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a partition function on a finite version of this model and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition function and correlation function. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in several applications through its various scaling limits, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions G, H and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>A Purely Geometric Variant of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale--Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n - o(n)$, as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and at least $n/3$, for every $n$. Moreover, these can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>
