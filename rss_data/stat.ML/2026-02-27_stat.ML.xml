      <title>LoBoost: Fast Model-Native Local Conformal Prediction for Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-boosted decision trees are among the strongest off-the-shelf predictors for tabular regression, but point predictions alone do not quantify uncertainty. Conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage, yet split conformal uses a single global residual quantile and can be poorly adaptive under heteroscedasticity. Methods that improve adaptivity typically fit auxiliary nuisance models or introduce additional data splits/partitions to learn the conformal score, increasing cost and reducing data efficiency. We propose LoBoost, a model-native local conformal method that reuses the fitted ensemble's leaf structure to define multiscale calibration groups. Each input is encoded by its sequence of visited leaves; at resolution level k, we group points by matching prefixes of leaf indices across the first k trees and calibrate residual quantiles within each group. LoBoost requires no retraining, auxiliary models, or extra splitting beyond the standard train/calibration split. Experiments show competitive interval quality, improved test MSE on most datasets, and large calibration speedups.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching is Adaptive to Manifold Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a simulation-free alternative to diffusion-based generative modeling, producing samples by solving an ODE whose time-dependent velocity field is learned along an interpolation between a simple source distribution (e.g., a standard normal) and a target data distribution. Flow-based methods often exhibit greater training stability and have achieved strong empirical performance in high-dimensional settings where data concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold, such as text-to-image synthesis, video generation, and molecular structure generation. Despite this success, existing theoretical analyses of flow matching assume target distributions with smooth, full-dimensional densities, leaving its effectiveness in manifold-supported settings largely unexplained. To this end, we theoretically analyze flow matching with linear interpolation when the target distribution is supported on a smooth manifold. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the learned velocity field, and then propagate this estimation error through the ODE to obtain statistical consistency of the implicit density estimator induced by the flow-matching objective. The resulting convergence rate is near minimax-optimal, depends only on the intrinsic dimension, and reflects the smoothness of both the manifold and the target distribution. Together, these results provide a principled explanation for how flow matching adapts to intrinsic data geometry and circumvents the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>From Shallow Bayesian Neural Networks to Gaussian Processes: General Convergence, Identifiability and Scalable Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study scaling limits of shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) via their connection to Gaussian processes (GPs), with an emphasis on statistical modeling, identifiability, and scalable inference. We first establish a general convergence result from BNNs to GPs by relaxing assumptions used in prior formulations, and we compare alternative parameterizations of the limiting GP model. Building on this theory, we propose a new covariance function defined as a convex mixture of components induced by four widely used activation functions, and we characterize key properties including positive definiteness and both strict and practical identifiability under different input designs. For computation, we develop a scalable maximum a posterior (MAP) training and prediction procedure using a Nystr\"om approximation, and we show how the Nystr\"om rank and anchor selection control the cost-accuracy trade-off. Experiments on controlled simulations and real-world tabular datasets demonstrate stable hyperparameter estimates and competitive predictive performance at realistic computational cost.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Continual Learning for Amortized Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) enables efficient posterior estimation using generative neural networks trained on simulated data, but often suffers from performance degradation under model misspecification. While self-consistency (SC) training on unlabeled empirical data can enhance network robustness, current approaches are limited to static, single-task settings and fail to handle sequentially arriving data or distribution shifts. We propose a continual learning framework for ABI that decouples simulation-based pre-training from unsupervised sequential SC fine-tuning on real-world data. To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, we introduce two adaptation strategies: (1) SC with episodic replay, utilizing a memory buffer of past observations, and (2) SC with elastic weight consolidation, which regularizes updates to preserve task-critical parameters. Across three diverse case studies, our methods significantly mitigate forgetting and yield posterior estimates that outperform standard simulation-based training, achieving estimates closer to MCMC reference, providing a viable path for trustworthy ABI across a range of different tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond NNGP: Large Deviations and Feature Learning in Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wide Bayesian neural networks focusing on the rare but statistically dominant fluctuations that govern posterior concentration, beyond Gaussian-process limits. Large-deviation theory provides explicit variational objectives-rate functions-on predictors, providing an emerging notion of complexity and feature learning directly at the functional level. We show that the posterior output rate function is obtained by a joint optimization over predictors and internal kernels, in contrast with fixed-kernel (NNGP) theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting predictions accurately describe finite-width behavior for moderately sized networks, capturing non-Gaussian tails, posterior deformation, and data-dependent kernel selection effects.</description>

      <title>Kernel Integrated $R^2$: A Measure of Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce kernel integrated $R^2$, a new measure of statistical dependence that combines the local normalization principle of the recently introduced integrated $R^2$ with the flexibility of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed measure extends integrated $R^2$ from scalar responses to responses taking values on general spaces equipped with a characteristic kernel, allowing to measure dependence of multivariate, functional, and structured data, while remaining sensitive to tail behaviour and oscillatory dependence structures. We establish that (i) this new measure takes values in $[0,1]$, (ii) equals zero if and only if independence holds, and (iii) equals one if and only if the response is almost surely a measurable function of the covariates. Two estimators are proposed: a graph-based method using $K$-nearest neighbours and an RKHS-based method built on conditional mean embeddings. We prove consistency and derive convergence rates for the graph-based estimator, showing its adaptation to intrinsic dimensionality. Numerical experiments on simulated data and a real data experiment in the context of dependency testing for media annotations demonstrate competitive power against state-of-the-art dependence measures, particularly in settings involving non-linear and structured relationships.</description>

      <title>Regular Fourier Features for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating a Gaussian process requires sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which scales cubically with the number of sample locations. Spectral methods address this challenge by exploiting the Fourier representation, treating the spectral density as a probability distribution for Monte Carlo approximation. Although this probabilistic interpretation works for stationary processes, it is overly restrictive for the nonstationary case, where spectral densities are generally not probability measures. We propose regular Fourier features for harmonizable processes that avoid this limitation. Our method discretizes the spectral representation directly, preserving the correlation structure among spectral weights without requiring probability assumptions. Under a finite spectral support assumption, this yields an efficient low-rank approximation that is positive semi-definite by construction. When the spectral density is unknown, the framework extends naturally to kernel learning from data. We demonstrate the method on locally stationary kernels and on harmonizable mixture kernels with complex-valued spectral densities.</description>

      <title>Duel-Evolve: Reward-Free Test-Time Scaling via LLM Self-Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Truncation of Unbounded Data via Public Second Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data privacy is important in the AI era, and differential privacy (DP) is one of the golden solutions. However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.</description>

      <title>A 1/R Law for Kurtosis Contrast in Balanced Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|\kappa(y)|=O(\kappa_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_b\kappa_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim \kappa_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $\Omega(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Constrained Gibbs Measures: with Applications to High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a non-standard problem of generating samples from a low-temperature Gibbs distribution with \emph{constrained} support, when some of the coordinates of the mode lie on the boundary. These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics. Key examples of low-temperature Gibbs distributions include Bayesian posteriors, and we demonstrate our results on three canonical examples: a high-dimensional logistic regression model, a Poisson linear model, and a Gaussian mixture model.</description>

      <title>Sharp Convergence Rates for Masked Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Ranking Aggregation: Gossip Algorithms for Borda and Copeland Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.</description>

      <title>Effective sample size approximations as entropy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze alternative effective sample size (ESS) metrics for importance sampling algorithms, and discuss a possible extended range of applications. We show the relationship between the ESS expressions used in the literature and two entropy families, the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropy. The R\'enyi entropy is connected to the Huggins-Roy's ESS family introduced in \cite{Huggins15}. We prove that that all the ESS functions included in the Huggins-Roy's family fulfill all the desirable theoretical conditions. We analyzed and remark the connections with several other fields, such as the Hill numbers introduced in ecology, the Gini inequality coefficient employed in economics, and the Gini impurity index used mainly in machine learning, to name a few.
  Finally, by numerical simulations, we study the performance of different ESS expressions contained in the previous ESS families in terms of approximation of the theoretical ESS definition, and show the application of ESS formulas in a variable selection problem.</description>

      <title>A note on the area under the likelihood and the fake evidence for model selection</title>

Abstract: Improper priors are not allowed for the computation of the Bayesian evidence $Z=p({\bf y})$ (a.k.a., marginal likelihood), since in this case $Z$ is not completely specified due to an arbitrary constant involved in the computation. However, in this work, we remark that they can be employed in a specific type of model selection problem: when we have several (possibly infinite) models belonging to the same parametric family (i.e., for tuning parameters of a parametric model). However, the quantities involved in this type of selection cannot be considered as Bayesian evidences: we suggest to use the name ``fake evidences'' (or ``areas under the likelihood'' in the case of uniform improper priors). We also show that, in this model selection scenario, using a diffuse prior and increasing its scale parameter asymptotically to infinity, we cannot recover the value of the area under the likelihood, obtained with a uniform improper prior. We first discuss it from a general point of view. Then we provide, as an applicative example, all the details for Bayesian regression models with nonlinear bases, considering two cases: the use of a uniform improper prior and the use of a Gaussian prior, respectively. A numerical experiment is also provided confirming and checking all the previous statements.</description>

      <title>An automatic counting algorithm for the quantification and uncertainty analysis of the number of microglial cells trainable in small and heterogeneous datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.</description>

      <title>Low-degree Lower bounds for clustering in moderate dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of clustering $n$ points into $K$ groups drawn from a mixture of isotropic Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $\Delta$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $\Delta$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a "non-parametric rate". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>Regularized Online RLHF with Generalized Bilinear Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $\eta^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(\eta)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\eta d^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\eta r T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting In-Context Learning: A Theoretical Analysis of Linear Attention Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Zero-One Loss via Hypersimplex Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.</description>

      <title>Mean Estimation from Coarse Data: Characterizations and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]</description>

      <title>Approximation Error and Complexity Bounds for ReLU Networks on Low-Regular Function Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation of a large class of bounded functions, with minimal regularity assumptions, by ReLU neural networks. We show that the approximation error can be bounded from above by a quantity proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth. We inherit this approximation error bound from Fourier features residual networks, a type of neural network that uses complex exponential activation functions. Our proof is constructive and proceeds by conducting a careful complexity analysis associated with the approximation of a Fourier features residual network by a ReLU network.</description>

      <title>Representative, Informative, and De-Amplifying: Requirements for Robust Bayesian Active Learning under Model Misspecification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many settings in science and industry, such as drug discovery and clinical trials, a central challenge is designing experiments under time and budget constraints. Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a paradigm to pick maximally informative designs that has been increasingly applied to such problems. During training, BOED selects inputs according to a pre-determined acquisition criterion to target informativeness. During testing, the model learned during training encounters a naturally occurring distribution of test samples. This leads to an instance of covariate shift, where the train and test samples are drawn from different distributions (the training samples are not representative of the test distribution). Prior work has shown that in the presence of model misspecification, covariate shift amplifies generalization error. Our first contribution is to provide a mathematical analysis of generalization error that reveals key contributors to generalization error in the presence of model misspecification. We show that generalization error under misspecification is the result of, in addition to covariate shift, a phenomenon we term error (de-)amplification which has not been identified or studied in prior work. We then develop a new acquisition function that mitigates the effects of model misspecification by including terms for representativeness, informativeness, and de-amplification (R-IDeA). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than methods that target either only informativeness, representativeness, or both.</description>

      <title>On the Interpolation Error of Nonlinear Attention versus Linear Regression</title>

Abstract: Attention has become the core building block of modern machine learning (ML) by efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies among input tokens. Its inherently parallelizable structure allows for efficient performance scaling with the rapidly increasing size of both data and model parameters. Despite its central role, the theoretical understanding of Attention, especially in the nonlinear setting, is progressing at a more modest pace.
  This paper provides a precise characterization of the interpolation error for a nonlinear Attention, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and the embedding dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Under a signal-plus-noise data model and for fixed Attention weights, we derive explicit (limiting) expressions for the mean-squared interpolation error. Leveraging recent advances in random matrix theory, we show that nonlinear Attention generally incurs a larger interpolation error than linear regression on random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the input contains a structured signal, particularly if the Attention weights align with the signal direction. Our theoretical insights are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Sharing information from multiple distinct yet related physical systems can alleviate this ill-possendess. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard multi-system Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of a specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>One-Step Diffusion Samplers via Self-Distillation and Deterministic Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics. Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions. Our proposed sampler therefore achieves both fast sampling and stable evidence estimate in only one or few steps. Across challenging synthetic and Bayesian benchmarks, it achieves competitive sample quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer network evaluations while maintaining robust ELBO estimates.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Precision in High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-precision training is critical for optimizing the trade-off between model quality and training costs, necessitating the joint allocation of model size, dataset size, and numerical precision. While empirical scaling laws suggest that quantization impacts effective model and data capacities or acts as an additive error, the theoretical mechanisms governing these effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. By rigorously characterizing the complex interplay among model scale, dataset size, and quantization error, our work provides a principled theoretical basis for optimizing training protocols under practical hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=\sigma_k^{2}/(2\mu_k)$, with $\mu_k{=}\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $\sigma_k^2{=}\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/\mu_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\sum_k C_k \approx \mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\% over MI and 56.2\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured.</description>

      <title>Towards a Sharp Analysis of Offline Policy Learning for $f$-Divergence-Regularized Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many offline reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by $f$-divergence regularization, but their sample complexity *defined with respect to regularized objectives* still lacks tight analyses, especially in terms of concrete data coverage conditions. In this paper, we study the exact concentrability requirements to achieve the $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity for offline $f$-divergence-regularized contextual bandits. For reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one, we achieve an $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under single-policy concentrability for the first time via a novel pessimism-based analysis, surpassing existing $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. We also propose a near-matching lower bound, demonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability is necessary to maximally exploit the curvature property of reverse KL. Moreover, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL *does not* belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without pessimistic estimation or single-policy concentrability. We further corroborate our theoretical insights with numerical experiments and extend our analysis to contextual dueling bandits. We believe these results take a significant step towards a comprehensive understanding of objectives with $f$-divergence regularization.</description>

      <title>Using the Path of Least Resistance to Explain Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG), a widely used axiomatic path-based attribution method, assigns importance scores to input features by integrating model gradients along a straight path from a baseline to the input. While effective in some cases, we show that straight paths can lead to flawed attributions. In this paper, we identify the cause of these misattributions and propose an alternative approach that equips the input space with a model-induced Riemannian metric (derived from the explained model's Jacobian) and computes attributions by integrating gradients along geodesics under this metric. We call this method Geodesic Integrated Gradients (GIG). To approximate geodesic paths, we introduce two techniques: a k-Nearest Neighbours-based approach for smaller models and a Stochastic Variational Inference-based method for larger ones. Additionally, we propose a new axiom, No-Cancellation Completeness (NCC), which strengthens completeness by ruling out feature-wise cancellation. We prove that, for path-based attributions under the model-induced metric, NCC holds if and only if the integration path is a geodesic. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world image classification data, we provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical analysis and showing that GIG produces more faithful attributions than existing methods, including IG, on the benchmarks considered.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the regret-minimization algorithm for optimal design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting a subset of points from a dataset of $n$ unlabeled examples for labeling, with the goal of training a multiclass classifier. To address this, we build upon the regret minimization framework introduced by Allen-Zhu et al. in "Near-optimal design of experiments via regret minimization" (ICML, 2017). We propose an alternative regularization scheme within this framework, which leads to a new sample selection objective along with a provable sample complexity bound that guarantees a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution. Additionally, we extend the regret minimization approach to handle experimental design in the ridge regression setting. We evaluate the selected samples using logistic regression and compare performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a 50-class subset of ImageNet demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms competing approaches across most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery from Bivariate Continuous-Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the causal direction between a continuous variable $X$ and a discrete variable $Y$ from observational data. For the model $X \to Y$, we adopt the threshold model used in prior work. For the model $Y \to X$, we consider two cases: (1) the conditional distributions of $X$ given different values of $Y$ form a location-shift family, and (2) they are mixtures of generalized normal distributions with independently parameterized components. We establish identifiability of the causal direction through three theoretical results. First, we prove that under $X \to Y$, the density ratio of $X$ conditioned on different values of $Y$ is monotonic. Second, we establish that under $Y \to X$ with non-location-shift conditionals, monotonicity of the density ratio holds only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero in the parameter space. Third, we show that under $X \to Y$, the conditional distributions forming a location-shift family requires a precise coordination between the causal mechanism and input distribution, which is non-generic under the principle of independent mechanisms. Together, these results imply that monotonicity of the density ratio characterizes the direction $X \to Y$, whereas non-monotonicity or location-shift conditionals characterizes $Y \to X$. Based on this, we propose Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery (DRCD), a method that determines causal direction by testing for location-shift conditionals and monotonicity of the estimated density ratio. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DRCD outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Skewed Score: A statistical framework to assess autograders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity, or other factors. Here we propose a statistical framework based on Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to simultaneously assess their autograders while addressing their primary research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In addition, our method can be used to augment traditional metrics such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and clarifying sources of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling both performance analysis and bias detection.</description>

      <title>A comparison between geostatistical and machine learning models for spatio-temporal prediction of PM2.5 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ambient air pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges. Exposure to high concentrations of PM$_{2.5}$ have been linked to increased respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, more emergency department visits and deaths. Traditional air quality monitoring systems such as EPA-certified stations provide limited spatial and temporal data. The advent of low-cost sensors has dramatically improved the granularity of air quality data, enabling real-time, high-resolution monitoring. This study exploits the extensive data from PurpleAir sensors to assess and compare the effectiveness of various statistical and machine learning models in producing accurate hourly PM$_{2.5}$ maps across California. We evaluate traditional geostatistical methods, including kriging and land use regression, against advanced machine learning approaches such as neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines, as well as ensemble model. Our findings enhanced the predictive accuracy of PM2.5 concentration by correcting the bias in PurpleAir data with an ensemble model, which incorporating both spatiotemporal dependencies and machine learning models.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Joint Multi-State Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional joint modeling approaches generally characterize the relationship between longitudinal biomarkers and discrete event occurrences within terminal, recurring or competing risk settings, thereby offering a limited representation of complex, multi-state trajectories.
  We propose a general multi-state joint modeling framework that unifies longitudinal biomarker dynamics with multi-state time-to-event processes defined on arbitrary directed graphs. The proposed framework also accomodates nonlinear longitudinal submodels and scalable inference via stochastic gradient descent. This formulation encompasses both Markovian and semi-Markovian transition structures, allowing recurrent cycles and terminal absorptions to be naturally represented. The longitudinal and event processes are linked through shared latent structures within nonlinear mixed-effects models, extending classical joint modeling formulations.
  We derive the complete likelihood, model selection criteria, and develop scalable inference procedures based on stochastic gradient descent to enable high-dimensional and large-scale applications. In addition, we formulate a dynamic prediction framework that provides individualized state-transition probabilities and personalized risk assessments along complex event trajectories.
  Through simulation and application to the PAQUID cohort, we demonstrate accurate parameter recovery and individualized prediction.</description>

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity and High-Dimensional Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose \textit{DeepMartingale}, a deep-learning framework for the dual formulation of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems under continuous-time models. Leveraging a martingale representation, our method implements a \emph{pure-dual} procedure that directly optimizes over a parameterized class of martingales, producing computable and tight \emph{dual upper bounds} for the value function in high-dimensional settings without requiring any primal information or Snell-envelope approximation. We prove convergence of the resulting upper bounds under mild assumptions for both first- and second-moment losses. A key contribution is an expressivity theorem showing that \textit{DeepMartingale} can approximate the true value function to any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ using neural networks of size at most $\tilde{c} d^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, with constants independent of the dimension $d$ and accuracy $\varepsilon$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Since expressivity in this setting translates into scalability, our theory also motivates estimating the dimension scaling law to guide architecture design and the training setup in deep learning-based numerical computation and the choice of rebalancing frequency for the related hedging strategy. The learned martingale representation further yields a practical and dimension-scalable \emph{deep delta hedging strategy}. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional Bermudan option benchmarks confirm convergence, expressivity, scalable training, and the stability of the resulting upper bounds and hedging performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Answer from Correct Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). We formalize the problem as imitation learning (i.e., apprenticeship learning) in contextual bandits, with offline demonstrations from some expert (optimal, or very good) policy, without explicitly observed rewards. In contrast to prior work, which assumes the demonstrator belongs to a bounded-complexity policy class, we propose relying only on the underlying reward model (i.e., specifying which answers are correct) being in a bounded-complexity class, which we argue is a strictly weaker assumption. We show that likelihood-maximization methods can fail in this setting, and instead present an approach that learns to answer nearly as well as the demonstrator, with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class. Our method is similar to Syed and Schapire 2007, when adapted to a contextual bandit (i.e., single step) setup, but is a simple one-pass online approach that enjoys an "optimistic rate" (i.e., $1/\varepsilon$ when the demonstrator is optimal, versus $1/\varepsilon^2$ in Syed and Schapire), and works even with arbitrarily adaptive demonstrations.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Variance Path Principle for Accurate and Stable Score-Based Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based methods are powerful across machine learning, but they face a paradox: theoretically path-independent, yet practically path-dependent.
  We resolve this by proving that practical training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the score function.
  We propose the MVP (**M**imum **V**ariance **P**ath) Principle to minimize this path variance.
  Our key contribution is deriving a closed-form expression for the variance, making optimization tractable.
  By parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns data-adaptive, low-variance paths without heuristic manual selection.
  This principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks and providing a general framework for optimizing score-based interpolation.</description>

      <title>Learning Credal Ensembles via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Credal predictors are models that are aware of epistemic uncertainty and produce a convex set of probabilistic predictions. They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Random Network Distillation, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.</description>
