      <title>The Dual of Quantifier Elimination: Boolean Elimination over C and R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every finite Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities in C^n admits two uniform normal forms: an $\exists\forall$ form and a $\forall\exists$ form, each using a single polynomial equation. Both forms have one existentially quantified variable and one universally quantified variable; regardless of the complexity of the original formula, no longer quantifier blocks are needed. The constructions are explicit and have linear degree bounds. Optimality results demonstrate that no purely existential or universal normal form is possible over C.
  Over R, similar normal forms exist, including a singly-quantified $\exists$ form for Boolean combinations of equations and inequations, and $\exists^d$ and $\forall\exists$ forms for Boolean combinations involving order inequalities. Prior results establish the existence of a $\exists$ normal form for R by other methods. Finally, similar forms exist over Q as well.
  These results may be viewed as a dual to classical quantifier elimination: instead of removing quantifiers at the cost of increased Boolean complexity, they remove Boolean structure at the cost of a short, fixed quantifier prefix.</description>

      <title>Unorthodox Algebras and their associated Unorthodox Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper grew out of our investigation into a simple, but natural, question: Can 'F implies T' be distinct from F and T? To this end, we introduce five 'unorthodox' algebras that will play a major role, not only in providing a positive answer to the question, but also in their similarity to the 2-element Boolean algebra 2. Yet, they are remarkably dissimilar from 2 in many respects. In this paper, we will examine these five algebras both algebraically and logically. We define, and initiate an investigation into, a subvariety, called RUNO1, of the variety of De Morgan semi-Heyting algebras and show that RUNO1 is, in fact, the variety generated by the five algebras. Then several applications of this theorem are given. It is shown that RUNO1 is a discriminator variety and that all five algebras are primal. It is also shown that every subvariety of RUNO1 satisfies the Strong Amalgamation Property and the property that epimorphisms are surjective (ES). It is shown that the lattice of subvarieties of RUNO1 is a Boolean lattice of 32 elements. The bases for all the subvarieties of RUNO1 are also given. We introduce a new logic called mathcal{RUNO1} and show that it is algebraizable with the variety RUNO1 as its equivalent algebraic semantics. We then present axiomatizations for all 32 axiomatic extensions of mathcal{RUNO1} and deduce that all the axiomatic extensions are decidable. The paper ends with some open problems.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Fragment of Physical Propositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic analysis of the Operational Standard of Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, Vanzella (2024) showing that admissible measurement in Minkowski Spacetime yields only finite observational sequences and thereby restricts the class of physically meaningful propositions to those admitting terminating extraction procedures or uniform stability conditions. These correspond exactly to the arithmetical fragment $\Sigma^0_1 \cup \Pi^0_2$, and the induced realizability structure interprets $\Delta_0$ Heyting Arithmetic on the code of observational data. A diagonal argument then establishes an operational form of incompleteness: there exist true arithmetical propositions about admissible extraction that no sound, recursively axiomatizable theory of spacetime can decide. The result is structurally analogous to classical incompleteness but arises from the evidential limits of measurement rather than from ontological assumptions.</description>

      <title>Extended Contact Algebras: Algebraic analysis and duality theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ternary extended contact relation was introduced in (Ivanova, 2020) as a more expressive counterpart of the standard binary contact relation. The class of Boolean algebras expanded with the relation was named Extended Contact Algebras (ECAs). In this work, we take an algebraic perspective on ECAs, interpreting the ternary relation as a form of entailment. We introduce Pseudo-Inference Algebras, purely algebraic tructures where the ternary relation is replaced by a monotone ternary operator, capturing the logical character of extended contact. We show that the subclass of relational Pseudo-Inference Algebras corresponds precisely to ECAs and generates a subvariety of strict PSI-Algebras, which forms a discriminator variety. Furthermore, we extend Stone duality to this ternary context, introducing descriptive PSI-frames and establishing three interrelated dualities that differ in their morphisms while sharing the same class of topological objects. The framework developed in the paper provides a nified relational semantics for Boolean algebras equipped with monotone ternary operators, connecting spatial and logical notions within a categorical and topological setting.</description>

      <title>Weihrauch reducibility between Ramsey-type theorems and well-ordering principles at the level of $\Sigma^0_2$-induction: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relations under Weihrauch reducibility of the well-ordering preservation principle for the operator $X \mapsto X^\omega$ and the Ordered Ramsey Theorem. Both principles are known to be equivalent to $\Sigma^0_2$-induction in Reverse Mathematics.
  We show that the Ordered Ramsey Theorem is Weihrauch-equivalent to the parallel product of the well-ordering preservation principle for the operator $X \mapsto X^\omega$ and the Eventually Constant Tail principle.
  By previous work from Pauly, Pradic and Sold\`a, the Ordered Ramsey Theorem is known to be Weihrauch-equivalent to the parallel product of the Eventually Constant Tail principle and the parallelization of the jump of the Limited Principle of Omniscience. We show that the latter pinciple and the well-ordering preservation principle for $X \mapsto X^\omega$ are Weihrauch-incomparable.</description>

      <title>On BPI in Symmetric Extensions Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, proofs of $\mathrm{BPI}$ in models without choice have relied on a contradiction framework that was introduced by Halpern. We introduce the filter extension property for permutation models and symmetric extensions, which formalizes the na\"ive approach to extend arbitrary filters to ultrafilters by repeatedly extending filters by minimal increments. We use this framework to give the first direct proof of $\mathrm{BPI}$ in the generalized Cohen model $N(I,Q)$ -- a model that adds a Dedekind-finite set of mutually $Q$-generic filters over a ground model $M\vDash\mathrm{ZFC}$. In the case that the index set $I$ is large, we adapt Harrington's proof of the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem to prove the result. We then extend the results from Karagila and Schlicht to show that $I$ can be assumed to be large without loss of generality. The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension.</description>

      <title>Hall's Harem Theorem with controlled sizes of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new version of Hall's Harem Theorem, where the final matching is realized by a unary function with additional conditions on behavior of cycles. The present paper can be considered as a helpful companion of the paper of the author: arXiv:2105.06304, where a computable version of Hall's Harem Theorem with controlled sizes of cycles is proved. These two versions of Hall's Harem Theorem are independent: none of them follows from the other one.</description>

      <title>From coextensive varieties to the Gaeta topos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that in every coextensive variety V, the assignment that maps each algebra to its set of central elements is both functorial and representable. Furthermore, we prove that the full subcategory of finitely presented algebras in V is coextensive. Finally, we establish that if V is additionally (0, 1)-dense, the Gaeta topos classifies central-free V-models.</description>
