      <title>Stark Many-Body Localisation Under Periodic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stability of localisation under periodic driving in many-body Stark systems. We find that localisation is stable except near special resonant frequencies, where resonances cause delocalisation. We provide approximate analytical arguments and numerical evidence in support of these results. This shows that disorder-free broken ergodicity is stable to driving, opening up the way to studying nonequilibrium driven physics in a novel setting.</description>

      <title>Axial, Planar-Diagonal, Body-Diagonal Fields on the Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3: A Plethora of Ordered Phases under Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high-temperature disordered phase, for number of spin components n&gt;=3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. Furthermore, under application of a variety of uniform magnetic fields, a veritable plethora of phases are found. Under uniform magnetic fields, 15 different phases and two spin-glass phase diagram topologies, qualitatively different from the conventional spin-glass phase diagram topology, are seen. The chaotic rescaling behaviors and their Lyapunov exponents are calculated in each of these spin-glass phase diagram topologies. These results are obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the hypercubic spatial lattice. Axial, planar-diagonal, or body-diagonal finite-strength uniform fields are applied to n=2 and 3 component cubic-spin spin-glass systems in d=3.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mobility Rings in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through Avila global theorem, we analytically study the non-Hermitian mobility edge. The results show that the mobility edge in non-Hermitian systems has a ring structure, which we named as "mobility ring". Furthermore, we carry out numerical analysis of the eigenenergy spectra in several typical cases, and the consistence of the numerical results with the analytical expression proves the correctness and universality of the mobility ring theory. Further, based on the analytical expression, we discuss the properties of multiple mobility rings. Finally, we compare the results of mobility rings with that of dual transformations, and find that although the self-dual method can give the interval of real eigenvalues corresponding to the extended states, it can not fully display the mobility edge information in the complex plane. The mobility ring theory proposed in this paper is universal for all non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Extended unitarity and absence of skin effect in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking features of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems with arbitrarily small asymmetry in the hopping amplitudes and open boundaries is the accumulation of all the bulk eigenstates at one of the edges of the system, termed in literature as the skin effect, below a critical strength of the potential. In this Letter, we uncover that a time-periodic drive in such systems can eliminate the SE up to a finite strength of this asymmetry. Remarkably, the critical value for the onset of SE is independent of the driving frequency and approaches to the static behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We find that the absence of SE is intricately linked to the emergence of extended unitarity in the delocalized phase, providing dynamical stability to the system. Interestingly, under periodic boundary condition, our non-Hermitian system can be mapped to a Hermitian analogue in the large driving frequency limit that leads to the extended unitarity irrespective of the hopping asymmetry and the strength of the quasiperiodic potential, in stark contrast to the static limit. Additionally, we numerically verify that this behavior persists Based on our findings, we propose a possible experimental realization of our driven system, which could be used as a switch to control the light funneling mechanism.</description>

      <title>Canonical partition function and distance dependent correlation functions of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical $\,NLT\,$ partition function of a quasi-one dimensional (q1D) one-file system of equal hard disks [J. Chem Phys. \textbf{153}, 144111 (2020)] provides an analytical description of the thermodynamics and ordering in this system (a pore) as a function of linear density $\,Nd/L\,$ where $\,d\,$ is the disk diameter. We derive the analytical formulae for the distance dependence of the translational pair distribution function and the distribution function of distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use by calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks' separation. The correlation length presented for different pore widths and densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum at $\,Nd/L = 1\,$ and tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore width. The results indicate a special role of this density when the pore length $\,L\,$ is equal exactly to $N$ disk diameters. A comparison between the theoretical results for an infinite system and the results of a molecular dynamics simulation for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermally induced localization of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I unveil a novel variant of Anderson localization. This emergent phenomenon pertains to the motion of a dopant in a thermal spin lattice, rendered localized by thermal fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the intrinsic origin of localization for quenched disorder. The system of interest consists of spin-$1/2$ particles organized in a two-leg ladder with nearest neighbor Ising interactions $J$. The motion of a hole -- the dopant -- is initialized by suddenly removing a spin from the thermal spin ensemble, which then moves along the ladder via nearest neighbor hopping $t$. I find that the hole remains \emph{localized} for all values of $J/t$ and for \emph{all} nonzero temperatures. The origin is an effective disorder potential seen by the hole and induced by thermal spin fluctuations. Its length scale is found to match with the underlying spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$), the associated localization length of the hole increases with decreasing temperature and becomes proportional to the correlation length at low temperatures, asymptotically delocalizing at low temperatures. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$), there is a smooth crossover between thermal localization at high temperatures to localization driven by the antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. At infinite temperatures, the dynamics becomes independent of the sign of the spin coupling, whereby the localization length is a universal function of $|J|/t$, diverging as $(t/J)^{2}$ for $|J| \ll t$. Finally, I analyze a setup with Rydberg-dressed atoms, which naturally realizes finite range Ising interactions, accessible in current experimental setups. I show that the discovered localization phenomenon can be probed on experimentally accessible length- and timescales, providing a strong testing ground for my predictions.</description>
