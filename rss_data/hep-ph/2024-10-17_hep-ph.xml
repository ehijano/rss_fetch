      <title>A Study of Decay Rate of Bound Negative Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of experiments show that the decay lifetimes of muons bound to atomic nuclei are longer than the decay lifetimes of free muons. In this paper, a scheme of extending quantum mechanics (EQM) is proposed to resolve this problem. The Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger's equation is obtained to prove the validation of this attempt. The decay ratio of bound muons is also calculated in EQM, and the result is in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic neutrinos and the question of Dirac vs. Majorana neutrino nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments and with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

      <title>Cosmic neutrino background detection in the minimally extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of relic neutrino detection methods within the Standard Model, extended to include right-chiral neutrino singlets with Majorana mass terms. In particular, we study neutrino capture on unstable nuclei, the Stodolsky effect, coherent scattering, and an accelerator experiment. We demonstrate that the sensitivity transitions smoothly between Dirac and Majorana regimes, depending on the scale of lepton number violation. Importantly, neutral current interactions lead to transitions between the light and heavy neutrino states, necessitating the use of a density matrix formalism for accurate sensitivity calculations. As the oldest source of neutrinos in the universe, relic neutrinos would be able to provide an ultimate constraint on the lepton number violating scale, $m_R\gtrsim 10^{-33}~{\rm eV}$, below which neutrinos would behave as Dirac fermions for all practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Model independent bounds on heavy sterile neutrinos from the angular distribution of $\mathbf{B\to D^*\ell\nu}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the bounds that can be inferred on New Physics couplings to heavy sterile neutrinos $N$ from the recent measurements performed by the Belle collaboration of the angular analysis of $B\to D^*\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ decays, with $\ell=e,\mu$. Indeed, a sterile neutrino $N$ may lead to competing $B\to D^*\ell\bar N$ decays and Belle might have measured an incoherent sum of these two independent channels. After reviewing the theoretical formalism required to describe this phenomenon in full generality, we first perform a bump hunt in the $M_{\rm miss}^2$ Belle distribution to search for evidences of an additional massive neutrino. We found in such a way a small hint at $M_{\rm miss}^2 \sim (350\ {\rm MeV})^2$. However, the Belle angular analysis is sensitive to $N$ masses up to $\mathcal{O}$(50 MeV), preventing us to further inspect this hint. Nevertheless, we study the potential impact of this additional channel in the allowed mass range on the measured angular distributions and extract model-independent bounds on the new-physics couplings which could mediate such an interaction. In particular, in the mass window here inspected, we obtain the most stringent bounds for vector and left-handed scalar operators to date.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations for the hadronic VVA correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two types of dispersion relations for the hadronic vector-vector-axial-vector (VVA) correlator: one in generic three-point kinematics with fixed photon virtualities, the second in the kinematic limit of one soft photon. The VVA correlator enters in the electroweak contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and it also emerges as the leading term in the operator-product expansion for hadronic light-by-light scattering in the limit of two large photon momenta. Previously, this correlator was only described in terms of hadronic models. Our new dispersive treatments are in analogy to the established and the newly proposed dispersive approaches to hadronic light-by-light. The VVA correlator allows us to investigate the relation between the two types of dispersion relations in a simpler example and to elucidate the reshuffling of different hadronic contributions in this comparison. As a byproduct, we reduce the theoretical uncertainties on the first-family VVA contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment by combining the dispersive representation with both asymptotic and low-energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Pair production with capture by energetic cosmic ray nuclei in a photon background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ionization state of very energetic cosmic ray nuclei in photon fields, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in extragalactic propagation and the environment surrounding the acceleration site in astrophysical sources. We focus on the process of pair production with electron capture (PPC), where the interaction of a single photon with a nucleus produces an $e^\pm$ pair (similar to Bethe-Heitler process) with the subsequent capture of electron by the nucleus. This process effectively reduces the nucleus charge by one unit and counteracts the photo-ionization process. We show that during cosmological propagation, where the ultra-high energy cosmic rays interact predominantly with the CMB, ionization dominates over PPC for all the cases of practical interest. However, within the source environment and at sufficiently high energies, ionization and PPC processes can reach an equilibrium, leading to a significant fraction of dressed heavy nuclei. This provides a further limitation to the acceleration of high-$Z$ nuclei to very high energies in environments with hot and dense photon fields.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on low-lying hidden-bottom and double-bottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study on the spectrum of the low-lying hidden-bottom ($q\bar{q}b\bar{b}$ with $q=$ $u$, $d$ and $s$) and double-bottom ($q\bar{q}bb$) tetraquark states within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the instanton-induced interaction is taken as the residual spin-dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. All the model parameters are fixed by fitting the spectrum of the ground hadron states. The numerical results indicate that masses of several $X_{q\bar{q}}$, $Z_{b}$, and $Z_{bs}$ tetraquark states are below and near thresholds of corresponding meson-meson channels, thus these states may form components of exotic meson states with reasonable probabilities. Especially, in present model, masses of several obtained states with quantum number $I^G(J^P)=1^+(1^{+})$ are close to $Z_b^\pm(10610)$, so one may expect these states to be non-negligible components of the experimentally observed $Z_{b}$ states. Concerning to the double-bottom tetraquark states, the present results are in general consistent with other previous works. Two possible stable $T_{bb}$ states with quark content $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u$ or $d$ quark) lying at energies $10558$ MeV and $10650$ MeV are found, and one possible stable $bb\bar{n}\bar{s}$ state is found, whose energy is $\sim10687$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Testable leptogenesis and $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in extended seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of observable neutrinoless double beta decay $( 0 \nu \beta\beta)$ and viable leptogenesis within a low-scale extended inverse seesaw mechanism with additional sterile neutrinos. General effective field theory (EFT) considerations suggest that if there are experimentally observable signatures in $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay and a lepton asymmetry generated by heavy right-handed neutrino decays, thermal leptogenesis is likely to be unviable. However, in this work, we show that in the context of low-scale leptogenesis, one can obtain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and observable signatures of $0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay in the presence of additional sterile neutrinos. In this framework, the light neutrino masses are suppressed by the extended seesaw parameter, $\mu$, thereby allowing for $\mathcal{O}(10\, \mathrm{TeV})$ right-handed (RH) neutrinos, while avoiding small Yukawa couplings as in other neutrino mass models and near degeneracies in the RH neutrino spectrum as required by the low-scale leptogenesis paradigm. Contributions to the $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay rate from additional sterile neutrinos can be appreciable, while the corresponding contributions to the early universe lepton asymmetry washout rate are suppressed by other parameters not entering the $0 \nu \beta \beta$-decay amplitudes. We show that for keV-MeV scale, sterile neutrinos future ton-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments offer potential signals while maintaining viable leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate several femtoscopy correlation functions in the strangeness sectors $S=0$ and $S=-2$ for meson-baryon interactions. We combine the amplitudes of chiral perturbation theory at leading order with the TROY (T-matrix-based Routine for HadrOn femtoscopY) framework. We consider the correlation function for the $\pi^+$p and $\pi^-$p channels, which are currently under analysis by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC. Furthermore, we will show that analogous interactions can be used to reproduce the results for $K_S \Lambda$ correlation functions obtained by ALICE collaboration in PbPb collisions.</description>

      <title>Light new physics in the top quark sample from the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the general trend of looking for new physics at energies beyond the current reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), this article proposes a strategy to look for light new physics via a meticulous study of well known and well-measured kinematic distributions. In this article, we propose performing such a study in the top-quark sample since the LHC, being a top-quark factory, helps in precise measurement of several observables related to the properties of the top-quark. One such observable is the invariant mass $m_{b\ell}$ of the b-jet and the charged lepton obtained from fully leptonic decay of pair-produced $t \bar{t}$ events. Such a strategy can be employed to extract hints for any Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenario that allow for an exotic particle with mass close to the mass of top-quark ($m_t$) and can yield the same final state as fully leptonic decay of pair-produced top quarks. To provide a concrete study, we analyze a supersymmetric scenario with light right-handed stop quark with mass $\approx m_t$. The particle spectrum is such that the mass differences between the particles involved in the signal are small enough to lie in a potential blindspot and may be not yet firmly excluded by current LHC searches. Such spectra can yield a deviation from the Standard Model prediction in the lower region of the $m_{b\ell}$ distribution. This feature can be observed in any BSM framework that harbours light new physics that have so far escaped the LHC searches and hence can be used to extract light new physics signal irrespective of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Natural anomaly-mediation from the landscape with implications for LHC SUSY searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models with the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB) have run into serious conflicts with 1. LHC \textit{sparticle} and Higgs mass constraints, 2. constraints from wino-like WIMP dark matter searches and 3. bounds from naturalness. These conflicts may be avoided by introducing changes to the underlying phenomenological models providing a setting for natural anomaly-mediation (nAMSB). We examine spectra of nAMSB arising from string landscape. Here, we investigated LHC constraints on nAMSB models that allow $m_{3/2}$ to lie within 90$-$200 TeV which may soon be discovered or falsified by a combination of 1. soft OS dilepton plus jet+ MET (OSDLJMET) searches which arise from higgsino pair production, 2. non-boosted hadronically decaying wino pair production searches and 3. same-sign diboson + MET searches arising from wino pair production followed by wino decay to W +higgsino. Some excess above SM background in the OSDLJMET channel already seems to be present in both ATLAS and CMS data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the proton-antiproton scattering using a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the last experimental and theoretical advances in the analysis of possible baryonium resonances, the $X(1835)$ and their partners, we perform a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation of the proton-antiproton scattering in order to analyze the possible existence of bound states or near-threshold structures. The used $N\overline N$ potential is derived from a $G$-parity transformation of the quark-model-based $NN$ interaction which has described well deuteron properties, $NN$ phase shifts, and even hadron-hadron phenomenology. The additional $N\overline N$ annihilation is taken into account by a complex phenomenological potential whose real part is generated by one-pion and one-gluon exchange annihilation potentials and its imaginary part is an energy-independent potential of Gaussian form. Then, all the parameters of the interaction are constrained by the $NN$ sector except those determining the imaginary part of the annihilation potential. Our study concludes that the nucleon-antinucleon dynamics is complex and rich in scattering singularities near the proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron thresholds.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Fifth Force Using the Earth as a Spin and Mass Source from the Chinese Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment on the Chinese Space Station (CSS) to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. We demonstrate that the proposed experiment on the CSS offers several advantages compared to ground-based experiments. The high speed can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity allows efficient extraction of signals from background noises, thereby strengthening the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, one can improve the existing bounds on such interactions by up to five orders of magnitude. With advancements in sensor technology, we anticipate a further enhancement of four orders of magnitude, resulting in a total potential improvement of up to nine orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$ GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions and Big Bang nucleosynthesis, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>F\'eeton ($B-L$ Gauge Boson) Dark Matter Testable in Future Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the f\'eeton (gauge boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry) dark matter scenario, and first point out the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry can be a linear combination of the $B-L$ and the SM hypercharge gauge symmetries. With the redefinition of $B-L$ charge of fermions, the coupling between electron and f\'eeton can be enhanced. After showing the parameter space required from the DM stability and cosmic production, we discuss the potential for verifying them in dark matter direct detection experiments. The results show that future experiments, such as SuperCDMS, have a sensitivity to reach the f\'eeton DM region consistent with its cosmic production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly summarise the results for the four top-quark production process in the 4$\ell$ decay channel at NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD. We employ the narrow-width approximation for the treatment of the unstable particles, preserving spin correlations to NLO accuracy throughout our computations. The NLO QCD corrections are applied to both the production and decays of the four tops. We investigate the overall size of the NLO QCD corrections and the impact of neglecting higher-order effects in top-quark decays.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Aspects of Dark Matter Axions and Dark Photons Transitions within a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When axionic dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can convert into photons with energy near the axion's mass. Classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. However, one question remains: Does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? Answering this issue could lead to optimizations in searching for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity's quality factor $Q$; even if dark matter particles lack coherence, the conversion rate is still enhanced. Furthermore, the quantum perspective reveals an additional factor of $\pi/2$ in the transition rate compared to the classical result. Additionally, we also provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing $\tau$ lepton dipole moments at future Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moments of leptons represent excellent probes of the Standard Model and therefore also of possible new physics effects. In particular, the persisting hint of new physics in the muon $g$-2 motivates the investigation of similar effects also in the other leptonic dipoles. In this work, we examine the new physics sensitivity of the tau $g$-2 at future high-energy Muon Collider. We show that these facilities can access a number of processes like the Drell-Yan processes $\mu^+\mu^- \to \tau^+\tau^-(h)$, or vector-boson-fusion processes such as $\mu^+\mu^- \to \mu^+\mu^-\tau^+\tau^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu \tau^+\tau^-$ those can probe the tau $g$-2 at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-4})$, a resolution that is orders of magnitude better than the current bounds.</description>

      <title>Polarization options in inclusive DIS off tensor polarized deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near future, the Jefferson Lab $b_1$ experiment will provide the second measurement of tensor polarized asymmetries in inclusive DIS on the deuteron. In this asymmetry, 4 independent tensor polarized structure functions contribute. This necessitates systematic approximations in the extraction of the leading twist structure function $b_1$ from a single tensor asymmetry measurement. Contamination from higher twist structure functions and kinematic effects is discussed here. Using a deuteron convolution model, we quantify the systematic errors from these approximations for two different choices for the target polarization direction (momentum transfer, electron beam direction). For Jefferson Lab 12 GeV kinematics, the systematic error turns out to be comparable between the two polarization options, while at higher $Q^2$ values the momentum transfer direction is preferred.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflationary potential from NANOGrav 15-year Data: A robust study using Non-Bunch Davies initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the theoretical framework behind reconstruction of a generic class of inflationary potentials for canonical single-field slow-roll inflation in a model-independent fashion. The Non-Bunch Davies (NBD) initial condition is an essential choice to determine the structure of potential and to accommodate the blue-tilted tensor power spectrum feature recently observed in NANOGrav. Using the reconstruction technique we found the favoured parameter space which supports blue tilted tensor power spectrum. The validity of the EFT prescription in inflation is also maintained through the use of a new field excursion formula while keeping the necessary and sufficient conditions on the sub-Planckian field values in check. We find that the reconstructed potential display inflection point behaviour, which has deeper connection with high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Zeeman Effect: Relativistic Corrections Unveiled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the relativistic corrections to the Zeeman effect for hydrogen-like atoms based on the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We propose a relativistic GUP algebra using the Stetsko and Tkachuk approximation and incorporate these corrections into the Zeeman effect. In the relativistic limit, our results recover previously derived GUP corrections as well as the standard Lande energy shift expression when GUP effects are absent. This work presents a generalized expression that accounts for both relativistic and GUP corrections to the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety is a promising framework towards the understanding, in a non-perturbative way, of Quantum Gravity. It treats the Newton's constant G_N and the cosmological constant \Lambda as running coupling of an effective action. At the phenomenological point of view the values of G_N and \Lambda depend on the energy density of the system under consideration. This fact has interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences. The present work discusses the effects on the distance measurements from SNIa light curves and on the strong and weak gravitational lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicities of positive and negative pions, kaons and unidentified hadrons from deep-inelastic scattering of muons off a liquid hydrogen target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiplicities of positive and negative pions, kaons and unidentified hadrons produced in deep-inelastic scattering are measured in bins of the Bjorken scaling variable $x$, the relative virtual-photon energy $y$ and the fraction of the virtual-photon energy transferred to the final-state hadron $z$. Data were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration using a 160 GeV muon beam of both electric charges and a liquid hydrogen target. These measurements cover the kinematic domain with photon virtuality $Q^2 &gt; 1$ (GeV/$c)^2$, $0.004 &lt; x &lt; 0.4$, $0.1 &lt; y &lt; 0.7$ and $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.85$, in accordance with the kinematic domain used in earlier published COMPASS multiplicity measurements with an isoscalar target. The calculation of radiative corrections was improved by using the Monte Carlo generator DJANGOH, which results in up to 12\% larger corrections in the low-$x$ region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of divergent and collimated hot electrons via a novel multi-beam two-plasmon decay and stimulated Raman scattering mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions, the preheating risks associated with hot electrons generated by laser plasma instabilities (LPI) are contingent upon the angular characteristics of these hot electrons for a given total energy. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a novel multi-beam collaborative mechanism of two-plasmon decay (TPD) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and investigate the angular variations of hot electrons generated from this TPD-SRS instability (TSI) driven collectively by dual laser beams with varying incident angles $\theta_{in}$ ($24^{\circ}$ to $55^{\circ}$ at the incident plane) for typical ICF conditions. In the simulations with $\theta_{in}\gtrsim44^{\circ}$, TSI emerges as the dominant mechanism responsible for hot electron generation, leading to a wide angular distribution of hot electrons that exhibit both pronounced divergent and collimated components. The common Langmuir wave associated with TSI plays a crucial role in accelerating both components. By properly modeling the TSI common wave gains, we establish scaling relations between these gains and the energies of collimated and divergent hot electrons. These relations reveal that the divergent hot electrons are more sensitive to variations in gain compared to the collimated electrons. Additionally, the calculated gains qualitatively predict the asymmetry in hot electron angular distributions when the density gradients deviate from the bisector of the laser beams. Our findings offers insights for hot electron generation with multiple beams, potentially complementing previous experiments that underscore the critical role of overlapped intensity from symmetric beams within the same cone and the dominance of dual-beam coupling.</description>

      <title>Computing real-time quantum path integrals on Sewed, almost-Lefschetz thimbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of new tools, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $B_{c}$ meson decays to S-wave charmonia and $X(3872)$ within the covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semileptonic decays of $B_{c}$ meson to $\eta_{c}(1S,2S,3S)$, $\psi(1S,2S,3S)$ and $X(3872)$ within the framework of covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). We combine the helicity amplitudes via the corresponding form factors to obtain the branching ratios of the semileptonic decays $B_{c}\to \eta_{c}(1S, 2S, 3S)\ell\nu_{\ell}$, $B_{c}\to \psi(1S, 2S, 3S))\ell\nu_{\ell}$ and $B_{c}\to X(3872)\ell\nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=e,\mu,\tau$. In view of the $R_{J/\Psi}$ anomaly released by the LHCb collaboration, it is necessary to calculate the ratios $R_X$ with $X=\psi(1S,2S,3S),\eta_c(1S,2S,3S),X(3872)$ systematically, which are helpful to check the lepton flavor universality (LFU). Furthermore, we also take into account another two physical observables, one is the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_{L}$ and the other is the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, which can provide new clues to understand the $R_{J /\Psi}$ anomaly. Such theoretical predictions are necessary and interesting, which can be tested in the future LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Stabilization of Functional Renormalization Group Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit optimization of functional renormalization group flows by analyzing regularized loop integrals. This leads us to a principle, the Principle of Strongest Singularity, and a corresponding order relation which allows to order existing regularization schemes with respect to the stability of renormalization group flows. Moreover, the order relation can be used to construct new regulators in a systematic fashion. For studies of critical behavior, which require to follow renormalization group flows down to the deep infrared regime, such new regulators may turn out to be particularly useful. The general application of this principle is demonstrated with the aid of a scalar field theory which is solved over a wide range of scales with novel methods borrowed from numerical fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a factorization theorem was proposed for partonic flavor evolution as defined by the net flavor of the Winner-Take-All axis of a jet. We validate the factorization theorem through explicit calculation at two-loop order, and in the process extract all anomalous dimensions and renormalization factors for any ultraviolet-to-infrared flavor transition at this order. These results can then be used to extract the renormalized hard function for flavored jet production at next-to-next-to-leading order for any process of interest.</description>

      <title>Polarized and unpolarized off-shell $H^\ast\to ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ decay above the $2m_Z$ threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis of the off-shell $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ decay width is presented for both unpolarized and polarized $Z$ gauge bosons in the scenario with the most general $H^*ZZ$ vertex function, which is given in terms of two $CP$-even ($\hat b_Z$ and $\hat c_Z$) and one $CP$-odd ($\tilde b_Z$) anomalous couplings.
  The SM contributions to the $H^*ZZ$ coupling up to the one-loop level are also included. Explicit analytic results for the unpolarized and polarized $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ square amplitudes and the four-body phase space are presented, out of which several observable quantities can be obtained straightforwardly. As far as the numerical analysis is concerned, a cross-check is performed via \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, where our model was implemented with the aid of FeynRules. We then consider the most stringent bounds on anomalous complex $H^*ZZ$ couplings and analyze the effects of the polarizations of the $Z$ gauge bosons through the polarized $H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow \overline{\ell}_1\ell_1\overline{\ell}_2\ell_2$ decay width as well as left-right and forward-backward asymmetries, which are found to be sensitive to new-physics effects. Particular focus is put on the effects of the absorptive parts of the anomalous $H^*ZZ$ couplings, which have been largely overlooked up to now in LHC analyses. It is found that the studied observable quantities, particularly the left-right asymmetries, can be helpful to look for effects of $CP$-violation in the $H^*ZZ$ coupling and set bounds on the absorptive parts. For completeness, we also analyze the case of unpolarized $Z$ gauge bosons.</description>

Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and their multiplicity dependence serve as key tools for extracting parameters to be compared with theoretical models. Over the past decade, the scientific community has extensively studied the possibility of a system analogous to quark-gluon plasma, predicted in heavy nuclei collisions, also existing in collisions involving light nuclei and protons. We have reanalysed the data published by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. We present the dependence of the mean transverse momenta obtained in the soft and soft+hard (mixed) parts. Finally, we also discuss possible refinements of the analyses concerning the use of statistical parameters of higher order, aimed at a more detailed way of comparing the models with data.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in sterile neutrino dark matter in feeble gauged $B-L$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ model and examine the situation where the sterile neutrino is a dark matter candidate produced by the freeze-in mechanism. In our model, the dark matter $N$ is mainly produced by the decay of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scalar field $\phi$. We point out that the on-shell production of $\phi$ through annihilation of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge field $Z'$ plays an important role. We find that the single production of $Z'$ from the photon and the gluon bath can become the main production modes for $Z'$ in some parameter regions. To prevent $N$ from being overproduced, we show that the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge coupling constant $g_{B-L}$ must be as small as $10^{-14}$--$10^{-10}$. We also consider the case where the decay of $\phi$ into $N$ is kinematically forbidden. In this case, $N$ is generated by the scattering of $Z'$ and the $g_{B-L}$ takes values of $10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}$, which can be explored in collider experiments like FASER.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the strong azimuthal correlations, known as the alignment, in the families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. Results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for complex Stueckelberg dark photon dark matter. Such an effective construction can be realized by writing down a complete set of operators up to dimension six built with the complex dark photon and Standard Model fields. Classifying the effective operators, we find that in order to properly take into account the non-renormalizable nature of an interacting massive vector, the size of the Wilson coefficients should be naturally smaller than naively expected. This can be consistently taken into account by a proper power counting, that we suggest. First we apply this to collider bounds on light dark matter, then to direct detection searches by extending the list of non-relativistic operators to include the case of complex vectors. In the former we correctly find scaling limits for small masses, while in the latter we mostly focus on electric dipole interactions, that are the smoking gun of this type of dark matter. Simple UV completions that effectively realize the above scenarios are also outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos is considered, where the lightest neutrino is naturally massless. Instead of adopting texture zeros in the lepton Yukawa matrices, which cause both theoretical and experimental troubles, here we propose two-$\boldsymbol\epsilon$ textures, where $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is a small number. Combined with neutrino oscillation experimental data, we find that a large CP angle is preferred for the normal neutrino mass order. In contrast, the CP angle almost vanishes for the inverted order. This can be well-tested in near-future experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande. Besides, the predicted effective Majorana neutrino mass $m_{ee}$ and the total neutrino mass $\sum m^\nu_i$ are also within reach of ongoing or future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present the explicit form of the Regge trajectory relations for the triply heavy bottom-charm baryons, which can be applied to investigate both the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states. We estimate the masses of the $\lambda$-excited states and the $\rho$-excited states. The results are in agreement with other theoretical predictions. Both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. Moreover, the behaviors of the $\lambda$- and $\rho$-trajectories for various baryons are discussed. It is shown that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for baryons are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the light baryons are approximately linear and become concave as the masses of the light constituents are considered.</description>

      <title>Large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the complex 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19856v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As LHC's Run3 unfolds, we peer deeper into the couplings of the 125GeV Higgs ($h_{125}$) and also test for extra scalars. Even before such extra scalars are found, one can probe them by using the fact that theories with multiple Higgs doublets allow for substantial deviations of the couplings of $h_{125}$ from their SM values. Indeed, the observed couplings already place stringent limits on such theories. We investigate the curious possibility that $h_{125}$ couples to the top quark mostly as a scalar, while it couples to the bottom quark mostly as a pseudoscalar. This possibility was allowed by 2017 data for the so-called C2HDM; a two Higgs doublet model with a single source of explicit CP violation. It was shown recently that this possibility disappears when using the full experimental data of 2024. Here we discuss a three Higgs doublet with explicit CP violation (C3HDM), and show that the curious CP-even/CP-odd $t$/$b$ possibility is partly resuscitated, prompting further experimental exploration of this prospect.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal baryogenesis from MSSM flat direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inflection point inflation scenario where a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is identified with the inflaton. We focus on the case where the flat direction (inflaton) has non-zero baryon number, and consider a non-thermal baryogenesis scenario where the decay of the inflaton at the reheating directly generates baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Specifically, we consider a udd flat direction that is lifted by a superpotential operator of dimension 6, and show that inflection point inflation with the udd flat direction can be compatible with cosmological observations and can account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Charged pions asymmetry from the decay of light neutral axial mesons due to interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective three meson couplings, based in flavor U(3) quark-antiquark interactions, are considered to describe two light neutral axial meson Strong decays, $A \sim f_1(1285)$ and $f_{1S} (1420)$, and the charged rho meson decay in the following channels: $A \to \rho^\mp (770)+ \pi^\pm$, $A\to a_0^\mp (980) +\pi^\pm$ and $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$. By considering neutral meson mixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and $\eta-\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson interactions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a resulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions, $\Gamma_{\pi^+}/\Gamma_{\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be assumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons undergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other inelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic diffusion model for hadron production in p-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate charged-hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions of asymmetric systems within a nonequilibrium-statistical framework. Calculated centrality-dependent pseudorapidity distributions for p-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 and 8.16 TeV are compared with data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our approach combines a relativistic diffusion model with formulations based on quantum chromodynamics while utilizing numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation to account for the shift and broadening of the fragmentation sources for particle-production with respect to the stopping (net-baryon) rapidity distributions. To represent the centrality dependence of charged-hadron production in asymmetric systems over a broad region of pseudorapidities, the consideration and precise modelling of the fragmentation sources - along with the central gluon-gluon source - is found to be essential. Specifically, this results in an inversion of the particle-production amplitude from backward- to forward-dominance when transitioning from central to peripheral collisions, in agreement with recent ATLAS and ALICE p-Pb data at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>The Self-Organized Criticality of Dark Matter in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for dark matter freeze-out that results in the self-organized criticality in dark matter production, wherein the final relic abundance is independent of initial inputs, in analogy to scale invariance in other realms of non-equilibrium physics. The dynamic of self-organized is triggered through a semi-annihilation process $\chi \phi \to \phi \phi$ in the premise of the instability of dark partner $\phi$, where $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The relic abundance can be analytically ascertained when the dark partner is slightly heavier than the dark matter, which permits a substantially heavy dark matter mass without violating unitarity bounds. We demonstrate that this process provides a bridge between the freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and that the intricate dynamics of self-organized criticality can be actualized in a thermal dark sector bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of eight baryon sets and nine meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, M(n) = a Ln(n) + b, where $n$ is the order of excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryon and meson excited states would be related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study first-order electroweak phase transitions nonperturbatively, assuming any particles beyond the Standard Model are sufficiently heavy to be integrated out at the phase transition. Utilising high temperature dimensional reduction, we perform lattice Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate the main quantities characterising the transition: the critical temperature, the latent heat, the surface tension and the bubble nucleation rate, updating and extending previous lattice studies. We focus on the region where the theory gives first-order phase transitions due to an effective reduction in the Higgs self-coupling and give a detailed comparison with perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Clumps with Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark compact objects ("clumps") transiting the Solar System exert accelerations on the test masses (TM) in a gravitational-wave (GW) detector. We reexamine the detectability of these clump transits in a variety of current and future GW detectors, operating over a broad range of frequencies. TM accelerations induced by clump transits through the inner Solar System have frequency content around $f \sim \mu$Hz. Some of us [arXiv:2112.11431] recently proposed a GW detection concept with $\mu$Hz sensitivity, based on asteroid-to-asteroid ranging. From the detailed sensitivity projection for this concept, we find both analytically and in simulation that purely gravitational clump-matter interactions would yield one detectable transit every $\sim 20$ yrs, if clumps with mass $m_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^{14} \text{kg}$ saturate the dark-matter (DM) density. Other (proposed) GW detectors using local TMs and operating in higher frequency bands are sensitive to smaller clump masses and have smaller rates of discoverable signals. We also consider the case of clumps endowed with an additional attractive long-range clump-matter fifth force significantly stronger than gravity (but evading known fifth-force constraints). For the $\mu$Hz detector concept, we use simulations to show that, for example, a clump-matter fifth-force $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than gravity with a range of $\sim\text{AU}$ would boost the rate of detectable transits to a few per year for clumps in the mass range $10^{11} \text{kg} \lesssim m_{\text{cl}} \lesssim 10^{14} \text{kg}$, even if they are a $\sim 1$% sub-component of the DM. The ability of $\mu$Hz GW detectors to probe asteroid-mass-scale dark objects that may otherwise be undetectable bolsters the science case for their development.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Black Holes with Intermediate Masses at High Redshifts: an earlier generation of Quasars and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy is the largest fraction of the energy density of our Universe - yet it remains one of the enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries of the observable universe. We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses. In these models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we look at the implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase transitions in dark energy and associated peaks in black hole formation. It has been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation is associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that there will also be an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed at high redshifts are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of large Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z \sim 7$. The existence of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black Holes take care of some current challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also helps us look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here through targeted searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts $z \sim 18$. There is a slight dependence of the location of the peak on the lightest neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass. Finding these Dark Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the reach of upcoming observations - particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques focusing specifically on the redshifts around $z \sim 18$.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>Time-lag in hadronic channel: to explore delayed VHE-flare of 3C 279</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 28 January 2018, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) reported a significant very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray activity, occurring nearly 11 days after the high-energy (HE) gamma-ray flare observed by \textit{Fermi}-LAT from the blazar 3C 279. It has long been considered a candidate site for accelerating particles to ultra-high energies (UHE) and producing subsequent secondaries. Such an event can be crucial to explore the different phenomena of secondary production from the UHEs and viable to understand the energetics of the sources. Our study finds that the multi-wavelength flare, spanning UV, optical, X-rays, and HE gamma rays, originates from leptonic emissions, whereas the delayed VHE activity by proton synchrotron emission within the source, results from the extended duration of particle acceleration. To explain the prolonged electromagnetic emission, our model requires a magnetic field luminosity (L$'_B$) $6.1 \times 10^{43}$ erg/sec, a proton luminosity (L$'_{p}$) $1.2\times 10^{46}$ erg/sec in the jet frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimated using the unbiased exponential resummation formalism on (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical quark masses on $\Nt=8$ lattice, we present the first calculations of Lee-Yang zeros of QCD partition function in complex isospin chemical potential $\muI$ plane. From these zeros, we obtain the resummed estimate of radius of convergence, which we compare with the corresponding ratio and Mercer-Roberts estimates of the subsequent Taylor series expansions of the first three cumulants. We also illustrate a comparative study between the resummed and the Taylor series results of different partition function cumulants for real and imaginary values of $\muI$, discussing the behaviour of different expansion orders within and beyond the so-obtained resummed estimate of radius of convergence. We show that the reweighting factor and phasefactor begin to attain zero from this resummed estimate of radius of convergence. In this paper, we crosscheck this resummation methodology in baryochemical potential $\muB$ and affirm its validity in finite statistics limit. We also briefly compare this method with Taylor and \pade resummation results in $\muB$. We also re-establish this resummed radius of convergence can capture the onset of overlap problem for finite real $\muI$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Clocking the End of Cosmic Inflation</title>

Abstract: Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured in e-folds $\Delta N=N-N_\mathrm{end}$, in reference to the e-fold $N_\mathrm{end}$ at which inflation ended. Slow roll being necessarily violated towards the end of inflation, both the approximated trajectory and $N_\mathrm{end}$ are determined at, typically, one or two e-folds precision. Up to now, such an uncertainty has been innocuous, but this will no longer be the case with the forthcoming cosmological measurements. In this work, we introduce a new and simple analytical method, on top of the usual slow-roll approximation, that reduces uncertainties on $\Delta N$ to less than a tenth of an e-fold.</description>

      <title>Curbing PBHs with PTAs</title>

Abstract: Sizeable primordial curvature perturbations needed to seed a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be accompanied by a scalar-induced gravitational wave signal that can be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We derive conservative bounds on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at the PTA frequencies and estimate the implied constraints on the PBH abundance. We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics. The strength and the shape of the constraint depend on the shape of the power spectrum and the nature of the non-Gaussianities. We find that constraints on the PBH abundance arise in the mass range $0.1-10^3\, M_{\odot}$, with the sub-solar mass range being constrained only for narrow curvature power spectra. These constraints are softened when positive non-Gaussianity is introduced and can be eliminated when $f_{\rm NL} \gtrsim 5$. On the other hand, if the PBH abundance is computed via the theory of peaks, the PTA constraints on PBHs are significantly relaxed, signalling once more the theoretical uncertainties in assessing the PBH abundance. We further discuss how strong positive non-Gaussianites can allow for heavy PBHs to potentially seed supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>Spinning waveforms of scalar radiation in quadratic modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Accretion by Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs in dense astrophysical environments, such as planets or stars.</description>

      <title>Meson mass spectrum in QCD$_2$ 't Hooft's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of meson masses in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ governed by celebrated 't Hooft's integral equation. We generalize analytical methods proposed by Fateev, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov to the case of arbitrary, but equal quark masses $m_1=m_2.$ Our results include analytical expressions for spectral sums and systematic large-$n$ expansion. We also study the spectral sums in the chiral limit and the heavy quark limit and find a complete agreement with known results.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

      <title>Bridging inflation and reheating: chiral gravitational waves from aHz to GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate chiral gravitational wave (GW) signals generated from inflation to reheating, driven by a parity-violating (PV) term coupled to the inflaton. During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound horizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power spectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB as well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially detectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic instability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced amplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of backreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy scale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer a unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.</description>
