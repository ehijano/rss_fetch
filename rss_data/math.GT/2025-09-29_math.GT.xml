      <title>Satellite Operations and $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the knot invariant $\theta$ under satellite operations. First, we prove that $\theta$ is additive under connected sum. We then introduce a computational tool to generate $t$-twisted Whitehead doubles and apply it to explore the case of untwisted Whitehead doubles. We propose a conjecture describing the behavior of $\theta$ on untwisted Whitehead doubles and verify the conjecture for the first 2977 prime knots. The pair of invariants $\Theta = (\Delta,\theta)$ was introduced by Bar-Natan and van der Veen, where $\Delta$ is the Alexander polynomial. The invariant $\theta$ is easily computable and effective at distinguishing knots. Further exploration of satellite operations and $\theta$ is proposed to reveal new patterns among cables and general satellites.</description>

      <title>Groups versus quandle-like invariants of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risandles are nonassociative algebraic structures recently introduced to construct invariants of 3-manifolds. In this note, we show that the categories of groups and nonempty, faithful risandles are equivalent. In analogy to knot quandles, we also introduce fundamental risandles of 3-manifolds, which categorify the risandle coloring invariants of Ishii, Nakamura, and Saito. For infinitely many 3-manifolds, the equivalence of categories recovers the fundamental group from the fundamental risandle and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Thurston spine in a Teichm\"uller curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the Thurston spine $\mathcal{P}_g \subseteq \mathcal{T}_g$, we construct a Teichm\"uller curve $V \subseteq \mathcal{T}_g$. Then we characterize $V \cap \mathcal{P}_g$. More specifically, we show it is a trivalent tree and is an equivariant deformation retract of $V$. Moreover, by our construction, a lot of essential loops in the Thurston spine, both reducible and pseudo-Anosov, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Linking numbers for periodic tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic tangles are 1-dimensional submanifolds in the 3-space with translational symmetry. In this paper, we define the linking numbers for singly, doubly, and triply periodic tangles using appropriate motifs and show that they are well-defined and invariant under link-homotopy. Furthermore, we extend the notion to the higher order linking numbers for singly periodic tangles.</description>

      <title>Homology lens spaces and $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $Y$ is a closed, oriented 3-manifold with first homology $H_1(Y;\mathbb{Z})$ of order less than $5$, then there is an irreducible representation $\pi_1(Y) \to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ unless $Y$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$, a lens space, or $\mathbb{RP}^3 \# \mathbb{RP}^3$. By previous work it suffices to consider the case $H_1(Y;\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, which we accomplish using holonomy perturbation techniques in instanton Floer homology.</description>

      <title>Embedding calculus and Vassiliev spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vassiliev spectral sequence and Sinha spectral sequence are both related to cohomology of the space of long knots $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^3$. Although they have different origins, the Vassiliev $E_1$-page and the Sinha $E_2$-page are isomorphic (up to a degree shift). In this paper, we prove that they have isomorphic $E_\infty$-pages if the coefficient ring is a field. Together with degeneracy of the Sinha sequence, this implies that the Vassiliev sequence degenerates at $E_1$-page over $\mathbb{Q}$ including the non-diagonal part. Our result also implies that for any coefficient field, the space of finite type $n$ knot invariants is isomorphic to the space of weight systems of weight $\leq n$ if and only if the parts of the Sinha sequence of bidegree $(-i,i)$ degenerate at $E_2$ for $i\leq 2n$. For the construction of the isomorphism, we use a variant of Thom space model which was introduced in the author's previous paper and captures embedding calculus of the knot space in terms of fat diagonals. As a byproduct of the construction, we give a partial computation on differentials of unstable versions of the Vassiliev sequence which converge to finite dimensional approximations of the knot space.</description>

      <title>Bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations and their intersection coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce rational bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations on a marked surface $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ as a proposed topological model for the rational tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{Sp_4,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}(\mathbb{Q}^{\mathsf{T}})$ of the Fock--Goncharov moduli space [FG06]. Our space consists of certain equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs introduced by Kuperberg [Kup96], together with rational measures. We define tropical coordinate systems using the $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-case of the intersection number of Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW25], and establish a bijection using the framework of the graded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-skein algebra. This provides a topological perspective for Fock--Goncharov duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$.</description>

      <title>Strong positivity for the skein algebras of the $4$-punctured sphere and of the $1$-punctured torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kauffman bracket skein algebra is a quantization of the algebra of regular functions on the $SL_2$ character variety of a topological surface. We realize the skein algebra of the $4$-punctured sphere as the output of a mirror symmetry construction based on higher genus Gromov-Witten theory and applied to a complex cubic surface. Using this result, we prove the positivity of the structure constants of the bracelets basis for the skein algebras of the $4$-punctured sphere and of the $1$-punctured torus. This connection between topology of the $4$-punctured sphere and enumerative geometry of curves in cubic surfaces is a mathematical manifestation of the existence of dual descriptions in string/M-theory for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ $N_f=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Symplectic rational homology ball fillings of Seifert fibered spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize when some small Seifert fibered spaces can be the convex boundaries of symplectic rational homology balls and give strong restrictions for others to bound such manifolds. In particular, we show that the only spherical $3$-manifolds, oriented as links of the corresponding quotient singularities, which admit symplectic rational homology ball fillings, are the lens spaces $L(p^2,pq-1)$ previously identified by Lisca. In a different direction, we provide evidence for Gompf's conjecture that Brieskorn spheres do not bound Stein domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$. Finally, we establish restrictions on Lagrangian disk fillings of certain Legendrian knots in small Seifert fibered spaces.</description>

      <title>Algorithms in 4-manifold topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists an algorithm that takes as input two closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifolds and decides whether or not these 4-manifolds are homeomorphic. In particular, we explain in detail how closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifolds can be naturally represented by a Kirby diagram consisting only of 2-handles. This representation is used as input for our algorithm. Along the way, we develop an algorithm to compute the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of a closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifold from any of its Kirby diagrams and describe an algorithm that decides whether or not two intersection forms are isometric.
  In a slightly different direction, we discuss the decidability of the stable classification of smooth manifolds with more general fundamental groups. Here we show that there exists an algorithm that takes as input two closed, oriented, smooth 4-manifolds with fundamental groups isomorphic to a finite group with cyclic Sylow 2-subgroup, an infinite cyclic group, or a group of geometric dimension at most 3 (in the latter case we additionally assume that the universal covers of both 4-manifolds are not spin), and decides whether or not these two 4-manifolds are orientation-preserving stably diffeomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, it has been known that any open connected manifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6 admits a complex analytic structure whenever its tangent bundle admits a complex linear structure. For half a century, this has been conjectured to hold true for manifolds of any dimension. In this paper, we extend the result to manifolds of dimension 8 and 10. The result is proved by applying Gromov's h-principle in order to adapt a method of Haefliger, originally used to study foliations, to the holomorphic setting. For dimension 12 and greater, the conjecture remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for certain triangulations of surfaces, circle packings realising the triangulation can be found by solving a system of polynomial equations. We also present a similar system of equations for unbranched circle packings. The variables in these equations are associated to corners of triangles in the complex, with equations for interior vertices, edges, faces, and generators of first homology. The vertex equations are generalisations of the Descartes circle theorem, of higher degree but more symmetric than those previously found by the authors. We also provide some connections between the spinorial approach of previous work of the authors, and classical Euclidean geometry.</description>

      <title>The tangle-valued 1-cocycle for knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains the strongest and at the same time most calculable knot invariant ever.
  Let $\Theta$ be the topological moduli space of all ordered oriented tangles in 3-space. We construct a non-trivial combinatorial 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ for $\Theta$ that takes its values in $H_0(\Theta;\mathbb{Z})$. The 1-cocycle $\mathbb{L}$ has a very nice property, called the {\em scan-property}: if we slide a tangle $T$ over or under a given crossing $c$ of a fixed tangle $T'$, then the value of $\mathbb{L}$ on this arc $scan(T)$ in $\Theta$ is already an isotopy invariant of $T$.
  In particular, let $D$ be a framed long knot diagram. We take the product with a fixed long knot diagram $K$ and we consider the 2-cable, with a fixed crossing $c$ in $2K$. $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ gives an element in $H_0(\Theta)$. To this element we associate the {\em set of Alexander vectors}, consisting of the corresponding integer multiples of the one-variable Alexander polynomials of (the standard closures) of all sub-tangles of each of the tangles. We can vary the knots $(K,c)$ and moreover we can iterate our construction by starting now again the $scan$ with the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ and so on. The result is the infinite {\em Alexander tree}, which is an isotopy invariant of the knot represented by $D$.
  {\em As examples we show with just one edge of the Alexander tree that the knot $8_{17}$ and the Conway knot are not invertible!} This makes the Alexander tree a very promising candidate for a complete and "locally" calculable knot invariant, because the tangles in $\mathbb{L}(scan(2D))$ can be drawn with linear complexity and their Alexander polynomials can be calculated with quartic complexity with respect to the number of crossings of $D$.</description>

      <title>Liftable mapping class groups of certain branched covers of torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_{g,n}$ be a closed oriented hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points, with the understanding that $S_{g,0}=S_g$. Let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{h,n})$ be the mapping class group of $S_{h,n}$ and $\mathrm{LMod}_p(S_{h,n})$ be the liftable mapping class group associated to a cover $p:S_g\to S_{h,n}$. For the cover $p_k:S_k\to S_{1,2}$, Ghaswala, in his PhD thesis, derived a finite presentation for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ when $k=2,3,4$ and a finite generating set when $k=5,6$ using the Reidemeister-Schreier rewriting process. In this paper, we derive a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ for all $k\geq 2$. In the process, we also prove that the kernel of the homology representation $\Psi:\mathrm{Mod}(S_{1,2})\to \mathrm{GL}_3(\Z)$ is normally generated by a Dehn twist about a separating simple closed curve, and it is free with a countable basis. We also provide an explicit countable basis for $\ker\Psi$ consisting of separating Dehn twists. As an application of Birman-Hilden theory, we provide a finite generating set for the normalizer of the Deck group of $p_k$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_k)$ when $k=2,3$. We conclude the paper by proving that $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ is maximal in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{1,2})$ if and only if $k$ is prime.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-Algebra on the Khovanov-Sano Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets the symmetries of equivariant Khovanov homology, discovered by Khovanov and Sano, within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We identify the Shumakovitch operator $\hat{\nu}$ as a BV Laplacian whose nilpotency, a consequence of the algebra's defining relations, induces an $L_{\infty}$-algebra on homology. We prove this structure is non-trivial through explicit computations of higher brackets. Furthermore, we construct a dual $L_{\infty}$-structure, suggesting a unifying homotopy $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ symmetry. The main result of this paper is to lift this structure from homology to the chain level. Applying the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, we construct an intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-algebra on the Khovanov-Sano complex, whose $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class is a canonical link invariant. This provides a new algebraic framework in which we conjecture the origin of Steenrod operations in knot homology.</description>

      <title>A New Monotone Quantity in Mean Curvature Flow Implying Sharp Homotopic Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new monotone quantity in graphical mean curvature flows of higher codimensions is identified in this work. The submanifold deformed by the mean curvature flow is the graph of a map between Riemannian manifolds, and the quantity is monotone increasing under the area-decreasing condition of the map. The flow provides a natural homotopy of the corresponding map and leads to sharp criteria regarding the homotopic class of maps between complex projective spaces, and maps from spheres to complex projective spaces, among others.</description>

      <title>On the topology and combinatorics of decomposable arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be decomposable if there are no elements in the degree 3 part of its holonomy Lie algebra besides those coming from the rank 2 flats. When this purely combinatorial condition is satisfied, it is known that the associated graded Lie algebra of the arrangement group $G$ decomposes (in degrees greater than 1) as a direct product of free Lie algebras. It follows that the $I$-adic completion of the Alexander invariant $B(G)$ also decomposes as a direct sum of "local" invariants and the Chen ranks of $G$ are the sums of the local contributions. Moreover, if $B(G)$ is separated, then the degree 1 cohomology jump loci of the complement of $\mathcal{A}$ have only local components, and the algebraic monodromy of the Milnor fibration is trivial in degree 1.</description>

      <title>Infinite volume ends of quotient graphs and homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the space of infinite volume ends of a locally compact second countable (lcsc) space that admits a Radon measure. In certain cases, this coincides with the classical space of ends.
  Consider a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of a unimodular lcsc group $G$ that is not coamenable. Assume that $G$ has property (T) and the associated homogeneous space $G/\Gamma$ is equipped with the Haar measure. We demonstrate that if $G$ is path connected, then $G/\Gamma$ has exactly one infinite volume end. In a related vein, if $G$ acts transitively on a locally finite connected graph $X$ with compact open vertex stabilizers and the action of the subgroup $\Gamma$ is free, we show that $X/\Gamma$ has exactly one end. We also obtain identical results for certain discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of nonamenable product groups $G$.
  These results can be applied to understand ends of Schreier graphs and infinite volume ends of quotients of symmetric spaces of noncompact type. For instance, for symmetric spaces $X$ of noncompact type without real or complex hyperbolic factors, every infinite-covolume quotient $\Gamma\backslash X$ has exactly one end of infinite Riemannian volume.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant, whose numerators and denominators are essentially the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links, by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$-actions. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in $\operatorname{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$ to refine the basic perspective of the theory. For example, we present a new proof and a refinement of a theorem of Leclere and Morier-Genoud stating that the trace of $A \in \operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is always palindromic and sign coherent. We also show arithmetic/combinatorial results on left $q$-deformed rationals (e.g., the criterion for their palindromicity). Finally, we discuss the connection to the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets.</description>
