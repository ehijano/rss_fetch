      <title>Model structures on triangulated categories with proper class of triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast with the Hovey correspondence of abelian model structures from two compatible complete cotorsion pairs, Beligiannis and Reiten give a construction of model structures on abelian categories from one hereditary complete cotorsion pair. The aim of this paper is to extend this result to triangulated categories together with a proper class $\xi$ of triangles. There indeed exist non-trivial proper classes of triangles, and a proper class of triangles is not closed under rotations, in general. This is quite different from the class of all triangles. Thus one needs to develop a theory of triangles in $\xi$ and hereditary complete cotorsion pairs in a triangulated category $\T$ with respect to $\xi$. The Beligiannis - Reiten correspondence between weakly $\xi$-projective model structures on $\T$ and hereditary complete cotorsion pairs $(\X, \Y)$ with respect to $\xi$ such that the core $\omega = \X \cap \Y$ is contravariantly finite in $\T$ is also obtained. To study the homotopy category of a model structure on a triangulated category, the condition in Quillen's Fundamental theorem of model categories needs to be weakened, by replacing the existence of pull-backs and push-outs by homotopy cartesian squares.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the varietal notion of syntactic equivalence relation, we generalized it to a categorical concept; namely Equ-saturating category. We produce various examples and focuse our attention on the protomodular context in which any equivalence relation is then shown to have a centralizer.</description>

      <title>Surface Diagrams for Frobenius Algebras and Frobenius-Schur Indicators in Grothendieck-Verdier Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grothendieck-Verdier categories (also known as $\ast$-autonomous categories) generalize rigid monoidal categories, with notable representation-theoretic examples including categories of bimodules, modules over Hopf algebroids, and modules over vertex operator algebras.
  In this paper, we develop a surface-diagrammatic calculus for Grothendieck-Verdier categories, extending the string-diagrammatic calculus of Joyal and Street for rigid monoidal categories into a third dimension. This extension naturally arises from the non-invertibility of coherence data in Grothendieck-Verdier categories.
  We show that key properties of Frobenius algebras in rigid monoidal categories carry over to the Grothendieck-Verdier setting. Moreover, we introduce higher Frobenius-Schur indicators for suitably finite $k$-linear pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and prove their invariance under pivotal Frobenius linearly distributive equivalences.
  The proofs are carried out using the surface-diagrammatic calculus. To facilitate the verification of some of our results, we provide auxiliary files for the graphical proof assistant homotopy.io.</description>

      <title>The Relativity of Causal Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence reveal the limits of purely predictive systems and call for a shift toward causal and collaborative reasoning. Drawing inspiration from the revolution of Grothendieck in mathematics, we introduce the relativity of causal knowledge, which posits structural causal models (SCMs) are inherently imperfect, subjective representations embedded within networks of relationships. By leveraging category theory, we arrange SCMs into a functor category and show that their observational and interventional probability measures naturally form convex structures. This result allows us to encode non-intervened SCMs with convex spaces of probability measures. Next, using sheaf theory, we construct the network sheaf and cosheaf of causal knowledge. These structures enable the transfer of causal knowledge across the network while incorporating interventional consistency and the perspective of the subjects, ultimately leading to the formal, mathematical definition of relative causal knowledge.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models.</description>

      <title>A Natural Transformation between the Completeness and Compactness Theorems in Classical Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a categorical framework that reveals the deep relationship between the completeness and compactness theorems in classical logic. Although these theorems have traditionally been approached by distinct methods, our study shows that they are naturally equivalent through the lens of category theory. By introducing the basic concepts of categories, functors, and natural transformations, we establish that the model constructions derived from each theorem can be viewed as functors from the category of logical theories to the category of their models. In particular, one functor is defined using the Henkin construction from the completeness theorem, while another is defined based on the finite satisfiability condition of the compactness theorem. We then prove the existence of a natural transformation between these two functors, which demonstrates that the models produced by each method are isomorphic in a canonical way. This result not only bridges the gap between the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic perspectives but also provides a unified, conceptual framework that can be extended to other areas of mathematical logic. Our exposition is designed to be accessible, offering insight into both the categorical formalism and its implications for understanding fundamental logical theorems.</description>

      <title>Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module 2-categories.This is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise proper morphisms of $\infty$-topoi in terms of a relativised notion of compactness: we show that a geometric morphism of $\infty$-topoi is proper if and only if it commutes with colimits indexed by filtered internal $\infty$-categories in the target. In particular, our result implies that for any $\infty$-topos, the global sections functor is proper if and only if it preserves filtered colimits. As an application, we show that every proper and separated map of topological spaces gives rise to a proper morphism between the associated sheaf $\infty$-topoi, generalising a result of Lurie. Along the way, we develop some aspects of the theory of localic higher topoi internal to an $\infty$-topos, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Involutive Markov categories and the quantum de Finetti theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</description>

      <title>Higher Witt Groups for 2-Categories I: Centralizers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate monoidal, braided, sylleptic centralizers of monoidal, braided, sylleptic 2-functors. We specifically focus on multifusion 2-categories and show that monoidal, braided, sylleptic centralizers are multifusion again, via studying the corresponding enveloping algebras. We provide a characterization of the non-degeneracy condition for monoidal, braided, and sylleptic fusion 2-categories, via vanishing of their centers. Applying Double Centralizer Theorems, we establish the relationship between monoidal, braided, symmetric local modules and free modules. In particular, we obtain factorization properties of non-degenerate monoidal, braided, and sylleptic fusion 2-categories. Main results in this article will be used to study higher Witt equivalences of non-degenerate monoidal, braided, sylleptic 2-categories in the sequential articles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10822v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper considers non-Abelian homology groups for a diagram of groups introduced as homotopy groups of a simplicial replacement. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology groups of the group diagram are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the homotopy colimit of the diagram of classifying spaces, with a dimension shift of 1. As an application, a method is developed for finding a nonzero homotopy group of least dimension for a homotopy colimit of classifying spaces. For a group diagram over a free category with a zero colimit, a criterion for the isomorphism of the first non-Abelian and first Abelian homology groups is obtained. It is established that the non-Abelian homology groups are isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of the colimit functor defined on the category of group diagrams.</description>

      <title>Higher holonomy for curved L${}_\infty$-algebras 1: simplicial methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a natural morphism $\rho$ from the nerve $\text{MC}_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L)$ of a pronilpotent curved L${}_\infty$-algebra $L$ to the simplicial subset $\gamma_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L,s_\bullet)$ of Maurer--Cartan element satisfying the Dupont gauge condition. This morphism equals the identity on the image of the inclusion $\gamma_\bullet(L) \hookrightarrow \text{MC}_\bullet(L)$. The proof uses the extension of Berglund's homotopical perturbation theory for L${}_\infty$-algebras to curved L${}_\infty$-algebras. The morphism $\rho$ equals the holonomy for nilpotent Lie algebras. In a sequel to this paper, we use a cubical analogue $\rho^\square$ of $\rho$ to identify $\rho$ with higher holonomy for semiabelian curved \Linf-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>
