      <description>arXiv:2601.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An AG-monoid is an AG-groupoid (a groupoid satisfying the identity called left invertive law $(xy)z=(zy)x$) and having a left identiy. In this paper we enumerate AG-monoids algebraically and then implement them in GAP to compute them computationally.</description>

      <title>Aperiodicity properties of automorphism groups of free products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=G_1 \ast \ldots \ast G_k \ast F_N$ be a free product of finitely presented groups, where $F_N$ is a free group of rank $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $\mathrm{Out}(G,\mathcal{G})$ be the subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(G)$ preserving the set of conjugacy classes $\mathcal{G}=\{[G_1],\ldots,[G_k]\}$. Under natural conditions on the groups $G_i$ with $i \in \{1,\ldots,k\}$, we prove that the group $\mathrm{Out}(G,\mathcal{G})$ has a finite index subgroup $\mathrm{IA}(G,\mathcal{G},3)$ with notable aperiodicity properties. We show that the group $\mathrm{IA}(G,\mathcal{G},3)$ is torsion free and, if $\phi \in \mathrm{IA}(G,\mathcal{G},3)$, every $\phi$-periodic conjugacy class of elements of $G$ is in fact fixed by $\phi$ and every $\phi$-periodic conjugacy class of free factors of $G$ is fixed by $\phi$.
  As an application, we prove that, for every toral relatively hyperbolic group $G$, the group $\mathrm{Out}(G)$ has a finite index subgroup $\mathrm{IA}(G,3)$ with the same above mentioned aperiodicity properties. We in particular give another proof of the theorem, due to Handel-Mosher, that the kernel of the action of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ on $H_1(F_N,\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})$ satisfies natural aperiodicity properties.</description>

      <title>Various spectra and energies of subgroup generating bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of a group $G$. The subgroup generating bipartite graph $\mathcal{B}(G)$ defined on $G$ is a bipartite graph whose vertex set is partitioned into two sets $G \times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \in G \times G$ and $H \in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. In this paper, we compute various spectra and energies of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ and determine whether $\mathcal{B}(G)$ is hypoenergetic, hyperenergetic, CN-hyperenergetic, L-hyperenergetic or Q-hyperenergetic if $G$ is a dihedral group of order $2p$ and $2p^2$ and dicyclic group of order $4p$ and $4p^2$, where $p$ is any prime. We also show that $\mathcal{B}(G)$ satisfies E-LE conjecture for these groups.</description>

      <title>Morphisms of generalized affine buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of morphism for generalized affine buildings, also known as affine $\Lambda$-buildings, extending existing definitions and giving rise to a category of generalized affine buildings. For affine $\Lambda$-buildings equipped with a transitive group action, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of morphisms between them. As an application, we investigate under which conditions morphisms or isomorphisms between various generalized affine buildings from the literature (defined via lattices, norms, non-standard symmetric spaces, or \`a la Bruhat-Tits) can be defined. For generalized affine buildings coming from non-standard symmetric spaces we further show functoriality for subgroups and under change of valued field.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for the Shrinking Wellness Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well groups were introduced by Edelsbrunner, Morozov, and Patel to measure the robustness of geometric features of a function with respect to perturbations. Roughly speaking, the $r$-th well group measures the number of features that cannot be removed by perturbing the function by at most $r$. The Shrinking Wellness Lemma states that the rank of these groups decreases as $r$ increases. In the generality originally stated, it is wrong. We present a counterexample and give conditions under which the result holds. These conditions are general enough to cover most cases in which the well groups have been applied.</description>

      <title>Security Parameter Analysis of the LINEture Post-Quantum Digital Signature Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cryptographic analysis of the security parameters of the LINEture post-quantum digital signature scheme, which is constructed using matrix algebra over elementary abelian 2-groups. We investigate the influence of three principal parameters. First, the word size m (exhibiting quadratic impact), the second is a vector dimension l, and the third is a number of submatrices in the session key q (exhibiting linear impact) on cryptographic strength. Our analysis reveals a dualistic nature of the parameter l. According to the previous analysis, it does not affect resistance to guessing attacks. A deeper examination of the verification mechanism demonstrates that l establishes a kind of verification barrier of l times m bits. We establish the threshold relationship l less q minus 1 times m, below which parameter l becomes security-critical. The optimal selection rule l near q minus 1 times m is proposed for maximum cryptographic efficiency. Comparative analysis with NIST PQC standards and practical parameter recommendations are provided.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if a recursively presented group admits a (nonempty) subshift of finite type with nonzero Medvedev degree then it fails to have the strong topological Rokhlin property. This result simplifies a known criterion and provides new examples of recursively presented groups without this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Property P Conjecture, which was settled by Kronheimer and Mrowka, asserts that every $3$--manifold obtained by non-trivial Dehn surgery on a non-trivial knot is never simply connected. We propose new perspectives in studying Dehn filling from group theoretic point of view, which stem from several variation of the Property P conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Generalized Furstenberg Boundaries and Applications to Intermediate Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relative boundary theory for actions of discrete groups on compact spaces and use it to derive rigidity results for reduced crossed products. For a discrete group $\Gamma$ acting on a compact space $X$ and a subgroup $H$, we construct a universal boundary over $X$ which is minimal as a $\Gamma$-system and strongly proximal with respect to $H$. When $H\le_c\Gamma$ is commensurated and the $H$-action on $X$ is minimal, we show that this universal boundary agrees, in a canonical $\Gamma$-equivariant way, with the generalized Furstenberg boundary of $(H,X)$, thereby unifying and extending earlier results on relative boundaries.
  As an application, we introduce the notion of an $X$-plump subgroup given a $\Gamma$-space $X$, a generalized version of plumpness tailored to crossed products. Under natural dynamical hypotheses, this leads to new examples of irreducible $C^*$-inclusions. Under additional assumptions, we also show that every intermediate $C^*$-algebra is a crossed product.</description>

Abstract: We compute the continuous bounded cohomology of the full automorphism groups of regular trees in all positive degrees, with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations. To the author's knowledge, this seems to be the first instance where the continuous bounded cohomology is determined in all positive degrees with coefficients arising from any irreducible continuous unitary representations without being zero in all cases.</description>

      <title>Easy estimates of Lyapunov exponents for random products of matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be square matrices (over reals). Let $W=w(A_1, \ldots, A_k)$ be a random product of $n$ matrices. What is the expected absolute value of the largest (in the absolute value) entry in such a random product? What is the (maximal) Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give a complete answer to the first question. For the second question, we offer a very simple and efficient method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a random model for an $n$-fold branched cover of a finite acceptable $2$-complex $X$. This includes presentation $2$-complexes for finitely presented groups satisfying some mild conditions. For any $\lambda &gt;0$, we show that as $n$ goes to infinity, a random branched cover asymptotically almost surely is homotopy equivalent to a $2$-complex satisfying geometric small cancellation $C'(\lambda)$. As a consequence the fundamental group of a random branched cover is asymptotically almost surely Gromov hyperbolic and has small cohomological dimension.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>

Abstract: We prove that quasi-isometries of horospherical products of hyperbolic spaces are geometrically rigid in the sense that they are uniformly close to product maps, this is a generalisation of the result obtained by Eskin, Fisher and Whyte in [7]. Our work covers the case of solvable Lie groups of the form R ___ (N 1 x N 2), where N 1 and N 2 are nilpotent Lie groups, and where the action on R contracts the metric on N 1 while extending it on N 2. We obtain new quasi-isometric invariants and classi cations for these spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>
