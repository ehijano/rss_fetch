      <title>Recognition and constructive membership for discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide algorithms to decide whether a finitely generated subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ is discrete, solve the constructive membership problem for finitely generated discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, and compute a fundamental domain for a finitely generated Fuchsian group. These algorithms have been implemented in Magma for groups defined over real algebraic number fields.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy growth series of virtually abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the twisted conjugacy growth series of a finitely generated group, the formal power series associated to the twisted conjugacy growth function. Our main result is that this series is always an $\mathbb{N}$-rational function when the group in question is virtually abelian, and that this function can be explicitly computed from appropriate information about the group and the twisting endomorphism. We also show that the relative growth series of any twisted conjugacy class in a finitely generated virtually abelian group is itself an explicitly computable $\mathbb{N}$-rational function.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures and random walks on $\tilde{A}_2$-buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a non-elementary group action of a locally compact second countable group $G$ on a possibly non-discrete building $X$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$. We study $G$-equivariant measurable maps between a given $G$-boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ and the set of chambers of the spherical building at infinity. Using techniques from boundary theory, we prove that such a boundary map exists and is unique. As a consequence, we prove that if $\mu$ is an admissible probability measure on $G$, there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure $\nu$ supported on the chambers at infinity of the spherical building at infinity. We use this result to study random walks induced by the $G$-action, and we prove that for any base-point $o \in X$, $(Z_n o )$ converges almost surely to a regular point of the boundary under a second moment assumption.</description>

      <title>Braid groups of J-reflection groups and associated classical and dual Garside structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial generalisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was introduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the braid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the complex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the isomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism types of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these braid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same time, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the center of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient. Finally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of $J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual Garside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection groups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups provides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Length for Ducci Sequences on $\mathbb{}Z_m^n$ when $n$ is Even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D: \mathbb{Z}_m^n \to \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ be defined so \[D(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)=(x_1+x_2 \; \text{mod} \; m, x_2+x_3 \; \text{mod} \; m, ..., x_n+x_1 \; \text{mod} \; m).\] $D$ is known as the Ducci function and for $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$, $\{D^{\alpha}(\mathbf{u})\}_{\alpha=0}^{\infty}$ is the Ducci sequence of $\mathbf{u}$. Every Ducci sequence enters a cycle because $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ is finite. In this paper, we aim to establish an upper bound for how long it will take for a Ducci sequence in $\mathbb{Z}_m^n$ to enter its cycle when $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Binary-Input Multi-Valued Output Optical Cascades for Reversible and Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $S'$ be orientable finite-type surfaces of genus $g\geq 4$ and $g'$, respectively. We prove that every multitwist-preserving map between pure mapping class groups $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ is induced by a multi-embedding. As an application, we classify all homomorphisms $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ for $g\geq 4$ and $g' \leq 6\cdot 2^{g-4}$.</description>

      <title>Convex elements and Steinberg's cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study convex elements in a (twisted) Weyl group introduced by Ivanov and the first named author. We show that each conjugacy class of the twisted Weyl group contains a convex element, and moreover, the Steinberg cross-sections exist for all convex elements. This result strictly enlarges the cases of Steinberg cross-sections from a new perspective, and will play an essential role in the study of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations.</description>

      <title>Topological incidence rings and the incidence functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on working on incidence rings, a class of (possibly infinite) matrix rings indexed by ordered sets. Some general properties about them are given, including how they are always the inverse limit of finite matrix rings, giving a natural way to define their topology. We then show that such construction can be translated as a functor from the category of locally finite, preordered sets to the category of (topological) incidence rings that maps colimits to limits. We also shortly discuss the consequences of these results to the class of groups of units of incidence rings, as the unit functor allow us to translate most of the results.</description>

      <title>On a bijection between a finite group to a non-cyclic group with divisibility of element orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13247v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite group $G$ of order $n$ with a prime divisor $p$. In this article, we establish, among other results, that if the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is neither cyclic nor generalized quaternion, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $G$ onto the abelian group $C_{\frac{n}{p}}\times C_p$ such that for every element $x$ in $G$, the order of $x$ divides the order of $f(x)$. This resolves Question 1.5 posed in [15]. As application of our results, we show that the group with the third largest value of the sum of element orders in the set of all finite groups of order $n$ is a solvable $p$-nilpotent group where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ such that the Sylow $p$-subgroups are not cyclic.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups I: uncountably many coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a sphere with five punctures admits uncountably many non-equivalent, coarsely equivariant coarse median structures, falsifying a folklore belief. The same is shown for right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs are connected, triangle- and square-free, and have at least three vertices. Remarkably, in the latter case the coarse medians we produce are not induced by cocompact cubulations. In the process, we develop the theory of short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs), which also include Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type, graph manifolds groups, and extensions of Veech groups. We develop tools to modify their hierarchical structure, including using quasimorphisms to construct quasilines that serve as coordinate spaces, and this is where the abundance of coarse median structures comes from. These techniques are of independent interest, and we use them in a forthcoming paper to study quotients of short HHGs.</description>

Abstract: We study random walks on metric spaces with contracting isometries. In this first article of the series, we establish sharp deviation inequalities by adapting Gou\"ezel's pivotal time construction. As an application, we establish the exponential bounds for deviation from below, central limit theorem, law of the iterated logarithms and the geodesic tracking of random walks on mapping class groups and CAT(0) spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew bracoids have been shown to have applications in Hopf-Galois theory. We show that a certain family of skew bracoids correspond bijectively with left cancellative semibraces. A consequence of this correspondence is that skew bracoids in this family can be used to obtain and study solutions of the set-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation; we study this process and the resulting solutions. We give numerous examples of skew bracoids satisfying our hypothesis, drawing upon a variety of constructions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constructions for the Digraph Degree-Diameter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-diameter problem for graphs is to find the largest number of vertices a graph can have given its diameter and maximum degree. We show we can realize this problem in terms of quasigroups, 1-factors and permutation groups. Our investigation originated from the study of graphs as the Cayley graphs of groupoids with d generators, a left identity and right cancellation; that is, a right quasigroup. This enables us to provide compact algebraic definitions for some important graphs that are either given as explicit edge lists or as the Cayley coset graphs of groups larger than the graph. One such example is a single expression for the Hoffman-Singleton graph. From there, we notice that the groupoids can be represented uniquely by a set of disjoint permutations and we explore the consequences of that observation.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>
