      <title>Quantification of Information Flow by Dual Reporter System and Its Application to Bacterial Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here, we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and prediction of microglial cell dynamics in the ischemic penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the tissue surrounding the irreversibly injured infarct core, referred to as the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two distinct phenotypes; however, the dynamics between the detrimental M1 phenotype and beneficial M2 phenotype are not fully understood. Using phenotype-specific cell count data obtained from experimental studies on middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke in mice, we employ sparsity-promoting system identification techniques combined with Bayesian statistical methods for uncertainty quantification to generate continuous and discrete-time predictive models of the M1 and M2 microglial cell dynamics. The resulting data-driven models include constant and linear terms but do not include nonlinear interactions between the cells. Results emphasize an initial M2 dominance followed by a takeover of M1 cells, capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells, and suggest a persistent inflammatory response.</description>
