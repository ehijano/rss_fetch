      <title>Locally conformally homogeneous Lorentzian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study locally conformally homogeneous Lorentzian manifolds of dimension at least $3$, admitting an essential pseudo-group of local conformal transformations. Generalizing a recent result of Alekseevsky and Galaev, we show that any such manifold $(M,g)$ is either conformally flat, or locally conformally equivalent to a homogeneous plane wave. When the manifold is non-conformally flat, we show the existence of a codimension-one lightlike foliation of Heisenberg type, which leads to the plane wave structure. Our approach relies on tools from Gromov's theory of rigid transformations. Finally, we observe that the plane wave metric in the conformal class coincides with the Penrose limit of $(M,g)$ along some null geodesic.</description>

      <title>A Correspondence between Billiards and Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a geometric viewpoint, billiard trajectories and geodesics are related by mutual approximation results. In one direction, it is known that every geodesic curve in the boundary of a smooth convex body can be approximated by a sequence of billiard trajectories inside of it. We establish the other direction by proving that, for Riemannian billiard tables (under mild assumptions), there exists a family of fold-type surfaces such that every sequence of geodesic segments on these surfaces has a subsequence that converges to a billiard trajectory in the table. In particular, this is true for convex Euclidean tables. We also describe a more general class of tables to which this result applies and present explicit non-Euclidean examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify entire 2-dimensional area-minimizing or stable surfaces in R^4 with quadratic area growth as algebraic, cut out by a finite union of holomorphic polynomials whose collective degrees are controlled by the density at infinity. As a consequence, we obtain bounds on the singular set size and genus in terms of the density at infinity.</description>

      <title>Sharp $C^{1,\bar1}$ estimates in K\"ahler quantization and non-pluripolar Radon measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_\varphi$ denote the weighted Bergman kernel associated to a plurisubharmonic function $\varphi$. We obtain upper bounds and positive lower bounds for the Bergman metric $i\partial \bar{\partial} \log K_\varphi$, expressed solely in terms of upper bounds and positive lower bounds of $i\partial \bar{\partial}\varphi$. Our approach applies in both local and compact K\"ahler settings. As an immediate application we obtain the optimal $C^{1,\alpha}$-convergence for the quantization of K\"ahler currents with bounded coefficients. We also show that any non-pluripolar Radon measure on a compact K\"ahler manifold admits a quantization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence problem for complete contact forms with constant Tanaka--Webster scalar curvature on non-compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds. We prove that, under mild assumptions, the universal cover of a compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold admits infinitely many non-homothetic such contact forms whenever its fundamental group has infinite profinite completion. As applications, we treat complements of real or complex spheres in the standard CR sphere, as well as circle bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and the boundary of a Reinhardt domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider metric measure spaces $(X,\mathsf{d},\mathscr{H}^N)$ satisfying the properties (ETR), (LBD), and with an almost everywhere connected regular set. In particular, these assumptions are fulfilled by non-collapsed RCD$(K,N)$ spaces without boundary, as well as by non-collapsed strong Kato limit spaces without boundary. For both classes, we study orientability in the sense of metric currents, establish stability of orientation under pointed Gromov--Hausdorff convergence, and show that the pointed Gromov--Hausdorff limit coincides with the local flat limit.</description>

      <title>On characteristic foliations of metric contact-symplectic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compatible and associated metrics for a contact-symplectic pair $(\eta , \omega)$ on a manifold. We show that the integral curves of the Reeb vector field are geodesics for any compatible metric. We prove that all associated metrics share a common volume element, which we give explicitly. When the characteristic foliations of $\eta$ and $\omega$ are orthogonal with respect to an associated metric, their leaves, as well as those of the characteristic foliation of $d\eta$, are minimal. We construct explicit examples on nilpotent Lie groups and nilmanifolds where the characteristic foliations are not both totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Higher-Form Connections in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of higher-form connections on principal $\infty$-bundles in differential geometry. This is achieved by developing the formal differentiation and integration of maps from smooth manifolds to derived stacks with sufficient deformation theory. That allows us to introduce the Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid of a principal $\infty$-bundle and establish its global sections as the $L_\infty$-algebra of the derived higher symmetry group of the bundle. We define the space of $p$-form connections on an $\infty$-bundle as the space of order $p$ splittings of its Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid. We demonstrate that our new concept of derived geometric $p$-form connections recovers the known notion of connections on higher U(1)-bundles defined via \v{C}ech-Deligne differential cocycles. We further relate the $L_\infty$-algebras of derived higher symmetries of higher U(1)-bundles and higher Courant algebroids. Some applications in higher gauge theory and in supergravity are mentioned.</description>

      <title>A low-regularity Riemannian positive mass theorem for non-spin manifolds with distributional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes a low-regularity Riemannian positive mass theorem for non-spin manifolds whose metrics are only $C^0 \cap W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,n}$ and smooth outside a compact set. The main theorem asserts that asymptotically flat manifolds with nonnegative distributional scalar curvature have nonnegative ADM mass. The proof uses smooth approximations of the metric together with a Sobolev version of Friedrichs' Lemma, which yields improved convergence for commutators between differentiation and convolution operators. Rigidity is obtained for $C^0 \cap W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,p}$ metrics with $p&gt;n$ via the comparison theory of $\sf{RCD}$-spaces and a rigidity theorem for compact manifolds with metrics of nonnegative distributional curvature by Jiang-Sheng-Zhang. The argument relies on either elementary techniques or generalisations of the standard argument. In essence, a version of the main theorem of Lee-LeFloch is presented in which the spin condition is removed under the assumption that the metric is smooth outside a compact set.</description>

      <title>Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions with bounded index: Parallels to De Giorgi's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of De Giorgi -- motivated by analogy with the Bernstein problem for minimal surfaces -- asserts the rigidity of monotone solutions to the Allen--Cahn equation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, with $d\leq 7$.
  We establish close parallels to De Giorgi's conjecture for general solutions of bounded Morse index, far stronger than the minimal surface analogy would suggest: Namely, any finite index solution to the Allen--Cahn equation with bounded energy density in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is one-dimensional, and -- conditionally on the classification of stable solutions -- the same holds for all $4\leq n \leq 7$.
  As a geometric application, phase transitions with bounded energy and index in closed four-manifolds have smooth transition layers which behave like minimal hypersurfaces.
  Consequently, phase transitions exhibit a remarkably rigid behaviour in higher dimensions. This is in stark contrast with the 3D case, in which a wealth of nontrivial entire solutions with finite index (and energy density) is conversely known to exist, by work pioneered by Del Pino--Kowalczyk--Wei. The authors conjectured that any such solution must have parallel ends which are either planar or catenoidal, suggesting it as a parallel to De Giorgi's conjecture in this framework. We confirm this picture under the bounded energy density assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the splitting principle for differential K-theory, a refinement of topological K-theory that incorporates geometric data via differential forms. Using this principle, we prove that the differential $K^0$-ring associated to closed smooth manifolds admits a $\lambda$-ring structure. This structure enables a concrete construction of the Adams operations in differential K-theory introduced by Bunke. At last, we extend all these results to an equivariant setting associated with a compact Lie group action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.10853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holomorphic symplectic geometry of (the smooth locus of) the space of holomorphic sections of a twistor space with rotating circle action. The twistor space carries a line bundle with meromorphic connection constructed by Hitchin. We give an interpretation of Hitchin's meromorphic connection in the context of the Atiyah-Ward transform of the corresponding hyperholomorphic line bundle. It is shown that the residue of the meromorphic connection serves as a moment map for the induced circle action, and furthermore the critical points of this moment map are studied. Particular emphasis is given to the example of Deligne-Hitchin moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Functions, Excision and Higher Torsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing invariants from both topological and geometric perspectives is a key focus in index theorem. This paper compares higher analytic and topological torsions and establishes a version of the higher Cheeger-M\"uller/Bismut-Zhang theorem. In fact, Bismut-Goette achieved this comparison assuming the existence of fiberwise Morse functions satisfying the fiberwise Thom-Smale transversality condition (TS condition). To fully generalize the theorem, we should remove this assumption. Notably, unlike fiberwise Morse functions, fiberwise generalized Morse functions (GMFs) always exist, we extend Bismut-Goette's setup by considering a fibration $ M \to S $ with a unitarily flat complex bundle $ F \to M $ and a fiberwise GMF $ f $, while retaining the TS condition.
  Compared to Bismut-Goette's work, handling birth-death points for a generalized Morse function poses a key difficulty. To deal with this, first, by the work of the author M.P., joint with Zhang and Zhu, we focus on a relative version of the theorem. Here, analytic and topological torsions are normalized by subtracting their corresponding torsions for trivial bundles. Next, using new techniques from by the author J.Y., we excise a small neighborhood around the locus where $f$ has birth-death points. This reduces the problem to Bismut-Goette's settings (or its version with boundaries) via a Witten-type deformation. However, new difficulties arise from very singular critical points during this deformation. To deal with these, we extend methods from Bismut-Lebeau, using Agmon estimates for noncompact manifolds developed by Dai and J.Y.</description>

      <title>On the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we study the existence of balanced metrics of Hodge-Riemann type on non-K\"ahler complex manifolds. We first find some general obstructions, for instance that a Hodge-Riemann balanced manifold of complex dimension $n$ has to be $(n - 2)$-K\"ahler. Then, we focus on the case of compact quotients of Lie groups by lattices, endowed with an invariant complex structure. In particular, we prove non existence results on non-K\"ahler complex parallelizable manifolds and some classes of solvmanifolds, and we show that the only nilmanifolds admitting invariant structures of this type are tori. Finally, we construct the first non-K\"ahler example of a Hodge-Riemann balanced structure, on a non-compact complex manifold obtained as the product of the Iwasawa manifold by $\mathbb C$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces with harmonic mean curvature in complex space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11314v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces in complex space forms. We first show that when the mean curvature is a non-zero constant, the second fundamental form is parallel. We then consider the case in which the mean curvature is a non-constant harmonic function. Under the additional assumption that the Gaussian curvature is constant, we obtain a complete classification of such Lagrangian surfaces.</description>

      <title>A splitting theorem for manifolds with spectral nonnegative Ricci curvature and mean-convex boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for a smooth noncompact manifold with (possibly noncompact) boundary. We show that if a noncompact manifold of dimension $n\geq 2$ has $\lambda_1(-\alpha\Delta+\operatorname{Ric})\geq 0$ for some $\alpha&lt;\frac{4}{n-1}$ and mean-convex boundary, then it is either isometric to $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ for a closed manifold $\Sigma$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature or it has no interior ends.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathcal{D}^+_J$ operator on higher-dimensional almost K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce $\mathcal{D}^+_J$, a generalization of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$ operator on higher-dimensional almost K\"{a}hler manifolds. Using $\mathcal{D}^+_J$, we investigate the $\bar{\partial}$-problem in almost K\"{a}hler geometry and study a generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on almost K\"{a}hler manifolds. Analogous to the K\"{a}hler case, we prove the uniqueness and derive $C^\infty$ $a$ $priori$ estimates for solutions of the generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on an almost K\"{a}hler manifold $(M,g,\omega,J)$. We then study the Hermite-Einstein metrics on almost K\"{a}hler manifolds, in analogy with the classical K\"{a}hler geometry. Finally, we pose several open questions related to almost K\"{a}hler geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20598v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the ABP method developed by Brendle to establish the optimal $L^p$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, as well as a sharp $L^2$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality for submanifolds in manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. The sharp constants in both inequalities depend on the asymptotic volume ratio of the ambient manifold.</description>

      <title>Random Surfaces and Higher Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a characteristic function for laws of random surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,s] \times [0,t] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, in the spirit of expected path developments for one-dimensional stochastic processes into matrix groups. A key property is that path development is structure preserving: path concatenation becomes matrix multiplication. The main challenge is to account for two distinct concatenation operations for surfaces: horizontal and vertical. To address this, we use the notion of surface holonomy from higher geometry to define surface developments, and study this in a stochastic context. We generalize surface developments to the Young setting of $\rho$-H\"older surfaces, where $\rho &gt; \frac12$, show that such developments characterize parametrized surfaces. Our main result shows that the resulting expected surface development provides a computable and structured description of laws of random surfaces and leads to a natural metric on the space of probability measures on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime with borderline decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime was proved in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In 2023, the author extended the results of Christodoulou-Klainerman to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay that is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in 2023.</description>

      <title>Steklov isospectrality of conformal metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov spectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to natural gauge invariance, from its Steklov spectrum. Positive results are established in dimension $n\geq 3$ for conformal metrics under the assumption that the geodesic flow on the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. The paper combines wave trace formula techniques with the injectivity of the geodesic X-ray transform for functions on closed Anosov manifolds. It is shown that knowledge of the Steklov spectrum determines the jet at the boundary of the underlying Riemannian metric within its conformal class. In this particular context, this parallels the well-known results of the Calder\'on problem, where we are given the entire Dirichlet-to-Neumann map instead. As a simple corollary, assuming real-analyticity of the conformal factor, Steklov isospectral metrics must coincide. Using similar arguments, we are also able to prove under the same assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow on the boundary, that generically any smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the Steklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by the spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\"odinger operator with potential $q$. Consequently, in this case, two analytic Steklov isospectral potentials must be equal.</description>

      <title>Compactness of conformal metrics with constant $Q$-curvature of higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\ge1$ be a positive integer and let $P_g$ be the GJMS operator $P_{g}$ of order $2k$ on a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n&gt;2k$. We investigate the compactness of the set of conformal metrics to $g$ with prescribed constant positive $Q$-curvature of order $2k$- or, equivalently, of the set of positive solutions for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation. Under a natural positivity-preserving condition on $P_{g}$ we establish compactness, for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, under the following assumptions: $(M,g)$ is locally conformally flat and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $2k+1 \le n \le 2k+5$ and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $n \ge 2k+4$ and $|\text{W}_g|_g &gt;0$ in $M$.
  For an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the expression of $P_g$ is not explicit, which is an obstacle to proving compactness. We overcome this by relying on Juhl's celebrated recursive formulae for $P_g$ to perform a refined blow-up analysis for solutions of the $Q$-curvature equation and to prove a Weyl vanishing result for $P_g$. This is the first compactness result for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$ and the first successful instance where Juhl's formulae are used to yield compactness. Our result also hints that the threshold dimension for compactness for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation diverges as $k \to + \infty$.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description>
