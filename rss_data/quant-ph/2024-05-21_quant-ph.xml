      <title>Dynamical suppression of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect in Anyonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a fascinating phenomenon in nonequilibrium systems where eigenstates massively localize at the systems' boundaries, pumping (quasi-)particles loaded in these systems unidirectionally to the boundaries. Its interplay with many-body effects have been vigorously studied recently, and inter-particle repulsion or Fermi degeneracy pressure have been shown to limit the boundary accumulation induced by the NHSE both in their eigensolutions and dynamics. However, in this work we found that anyonic statistics can even more profoundly affect the NHSE dynamics, suppressing or even reversing the state dynamicss against the localizing direction of the NHSE. This phenomenon is found to be more pronounced when more particles are involved.The spreading of quantum information in this system shows even more exotic phenomena, where NHSE affects only the information dynamics for a thermal ensemble, but not that for a single initial state. Our results open up a new avenue on exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena arisen from the interplay between NHSE and anyonic statistics, and can potentially be demonstrated in ultracold atomic quantum simulators and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators in electronic structure using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator spreading has profound implications in diverse fields ranging from statistical mechanics and blackhole physics to quantum information. The usual way to quantify it is through out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which are the quantum analog to Lyapunov exponents in classical chaotic dynamics. In this work we explore the phenomenon of operator spreading in quantum simulation of electronic structure in quantum computers. To substantiate our results, we focus on a hydrogen chain $H_4$ and demonstrate that operator spreading is enhanced when the chain is far from its equilibrium geometry. We also investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglement and its dependence on the partition's size. Our findings reveal distinctive signatures closely resembling area- and volume-laws in equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium geometries, respectively. Our results provide insight of operator spreading of coherent errors in quantum simulation of electronic structure and can be experimentally implemented in various platforms available today.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lissajous Figures via Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new category of quantum Lissajous states for a 2DHO having commensurate angular frequencies. The states result from the projection of ordinary coherent states onto a degenerate subspace of the 2DHO. In this way, new, non-classical quantum mechanically stationary states arise from the classical but non-stationary coherent states. The connection to Lissajous figures is that our states all have probability densities that are localized along the corresponding classical Lissajous figures. We further emphasize the important interplay between the probability current density and the emergence of quantum interference in the states we examine. In doing so, we are able to present a consistent discussion of a class of states known as vortex states.</description>

      <title>Accurate Learning of Equivariant Quantum Systems from a Single Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting properties across system parameters is an important task in quantum physics, with applications ranging from molecular dynamics to variational quantum algorithms. Recently, provably efficient algorithms to solve this task for ground states within a gapped phase were developed. Here we dramatically improve the efficiency of these algorithms by showing how to learn properties of all ground states for systems with periodic boundary conditions from a single ground state sample. We prove that the prediction error tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit and numerically verify the results.</description>

      <title>A Study on Optimization Techniques for Variational Quantum Circuits in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing aims to streamline machine learning, making it more effective with fewer trainable parameters. This reduction of parameters can speed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources. However, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a limited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). VQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted through parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These circuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have presented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing promising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the effects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output scaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum proximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in the popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their ability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing effectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential learning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall performance. While input scaling does not improve parameter efficiency, output scaling effectively manages greediness, leading to increased learning speed and robustness.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Negative Mass Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, one analyzes two systems trying to obtain physical conditions where some properties attributed to negative mass can be mimicked by positive mass particles. The first one is the well-known 1/2-spin system described by the Dirac equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Assuming some physical restrictions, one obtains that the use of $e\rightarrow-e$ can lead to the same results as using $m\rightarrow-m$. In particular, for a null dielectric function, it is possible to obtain a negative mass behavior from a positive mass system composed of negatively charged particles. The second system is based on the de Broglie matter wave. The dispersion relation of such a wave can be negative (real or imaginary valued) if one assumes an imaginary wavenumber. The consequence is the emergence of a negative refractive index for positive mass particles. However, this behavior is generally attributed to a negative mass system.</description>

      <title>Phase-space negativity as a computational resource for quantum kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a proposal for achieving quantum computational advantage in machine learning. They are based on a hybrid classical-quantum computation where a function called the quantum kernel is estimated by a quantum device while the rest of the computation is performed classically. Quantum advantages may be achieved through this method only if the quantum kernel function cannot be estimated efficiently on a classical computer. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the efficient classical estimation of quantum kernel functions for bosonic systems. Specifically, we show that if the negativity in the phase-space quasi-probability distributions of data-encoding quantum states associated with the quantum kernel scales at most polynomially with the size of the quantum circuit, then the kernel function can be estimated efficiently classically. We consider quantum optical examples involving linear-optical networks with and without adaptive non-Gaussian measurements and investigate the effects of loss on the efficiency of the classical simulation. Our results underpin the role of the negativity in phase-space quasi-probability distributions as an essential resource in quantum machine learning based on kernel methods.</description>

      <title>Measurement dependence can enhance security in a quantum network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Nonlocality is an advanced study of quantum nonlocality that comprises network structure beyond Bell's theorem. The development of quantum networks has the potential to bring a lot of technological applications in sevaral quantum information processing tasks. Here, we are focusing on how the role of the independence of the measurement choices of the end parties in a network works and can be used to enhance the security in a quantum network. In both three-parties two-sources bilocal network and four-parties three-sources star network scenarios, we are able to show, a practical way to understand the relaxation of the assumptions to enhance a real security protocol if someone wants to breach in a network communications. Theoratically, we have proved that by relaxing the independence of the measurement choices of only one end party we can create a Standard Network Nonlocality(SNN) and more stronger Full Network Nonlocality(FNN) and we can get maximum quantum violation by the classical no-signalling local model. We are able to distinguish between two types of network nonlocality in the sense that the FNN is stronger than SNN, i.e., FNN states all the sources in a network need to distribute nonlocal resources.</description>

      <title>Ground state nature and nonlinear squeezing of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main bottleneck for universal quantum computation with traveling light is the preparation of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states of sufficient quality. This is an extremely challenging task, experimental as well as theoretical, also because there is currently no single easily computable measure of quality for these states. We introduce such measure, GKP squeezing, and show how it is related to the current ways of characterizing the states. The measure is easy to compute and can be easily employed in state preparation as well as verification of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Coherence spectroscopy by the Nth power of the measured signal in an interferometer overcoming the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence spectroscopy has been intensively studied over the last several decades for various applications in science and engineering. The Rayleigh criterion defines the resolution limit of an interferometer, where many-wave interference beats the resolution limit of a two-slit system. On the other hand, the diffraction angle in a slit is reduced by the Kth power of the measured signal, resulting in the shot-noise limit. Here, the Kth power of the measured signal in an N-slit interferometer is studied for enhanced coherence spectroscopy to overcome the resolution limit of the original system. The Kth power to the individual intensities of the N-slit interferometer is numerically demonstrated for enhanced resolution satisfying the shot-noise limit. As a result, the Kth power of the intensity beats the resolution limit of the N-slit interferometer, in which the out-of-shelf spectrometer or wavelength meter can be a primary beneficiary of this technique. Due to the same resolution of the Heisenberg limit in quantum sensing as in the N-slit interference fringe, the proposed Kth power technique also beats the superresolution in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Statistical Qubit Freezing Extending Physical Limit of Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum annealers encounter scalability challenges due to exponentially fast diminishing energy gaps between ground and excited states with qubit-count increase. This introduces errors in identifying ground states compounded by a thermal noise. We propose a novel algorithmic scheme called statistical qubit freezing (SQF) that selectively fixes the state of statistically deterministic qubit in the annealing Hamiltonian model of the given problem. Applying freezing repeatedly, SQF significantly enhances the spectral gap between of an adiabatic process, as an example, by up to 60\% compared to traditional annealing methods in the standard D-Wave's quantum Ising machine solution, effectively overcoming the fundamental limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resonant Dimensionality Reduction and Its Application in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising candidate for accelerating machine learning tasks. Limited by the control accuracy of current quantum hardware, reducing the consumption of quantum resources is the key to achieving quantum advantage. Here, we propose a quantum resonant dimension reduction (QRDR) algorithm based on the quantum resonant transition to reduce the dimension of input data and accelerate the quantum machine learning algorithms. After QRDR, the dimension of input data $N$ can be reduced into desired scale $R$, and the effective information of the original data will be preserved correspondingly, which will reduce the computational complexity of subsequent quantum machine learning algorithms or quantum storage. QRDR operates with polylogarithmic time complexity and reduces the error dependency from the order of $1/\epsilon^3$ to the order of $1/\epsilon$, compared to existing algorithms. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm combining with two types of quantum classifiers, quantum support vector machines and quantum convolutional neural networks, for classifying underwater detection targets and quantum many-body phase respectively. The simulation results indicate that reduced data improved the processing efficiency and accuracy following the application of QRDR. As quantum machine learning continues to advance, our algorithm has the potential to be utilized in a variety of computing fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Nonlinear Dynamics: Revisiting Carleman Linearization with No Dissipative Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the embedding of nonlinear dynamical systems into linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) via the Carleman linearization method. Under dissipative conditions, numerous previous works have established rigorous error bounds and linear convergence for Carleman linearization, which have facilitated the identification of quantum advantages in simulating large-scale dynamical systems. Our analysis extends these findings by exploring error bounds beyond the traditional dissipative condition, thereby broadening the scope of quantum computational benefits to a new class of dynamical regimes. This novel regime is defined by a resonance condition, and we prove how this resonance condition leads to a linear convergence with respect to the truncation level $N$ in Carleman linearization. We support our theoretical advancements with numerical experiments on a variety of models, including the Burgers' equation, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chains, and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, to validate our analysis and demonstrate the practical implications.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor trains from noisy functions with application to quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting TT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized TT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to embed the atomic magnetometer (AM) into an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). We analyze the effect of amplification of the Faraday rotation angle of the probe laser light, by properly postselecting the path-information state of the laser photons when passing through the MZI. The proposed scheme provides a postselected metrological protocol of probing weak magnetic fields, having a potential to further enhance the sensitivity of the nowadays state-of-the-art optical AM.</description>

      <title>Towards nonlinear optics with M\"ossbauer nuclei using x-ray cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong excitation of nuclear resonances, particularly of Mo\"ossbauer nuclei, has been a longstanding goal and the advance of novel x-ray sources is promising new options in this regard. Here we map out the necessary experimental conditions for the more general goal of realizing nonlinear optics with nuclei and compare with available technology. In particular, we present a comprehensive theory of nonlinear nuclear excitation in thin-film x-ray cavities by focused x-ray pulses. We thereby identify cavity geometries with broad resonances which allow one to boost the nuclear excitation even at moderately tight focusing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two- dimensional Fourier transform. We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm. As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Quantum Imaging using Natural Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is thought that schemes for quantum imaging are fragile against realistic environments in which the background noise is often stronger than the nonclassical signal of the imaging photons. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows a remarkable exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. Surprisingly, this measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Open-Path Detection of Organic Vapors via Quantum Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy was proposed as an alternative to conventional spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. In this way, harnessing induced coherence and spectral entanglement offers perspectives for practical organic gasses detection. Still, little research was conducted in order to bring QFTIR spectrometers closer to domestic or in-field usage. In this work, we first use such a spectrometer for open-path detection of multiple interfering organic gasses in ambient air. The accurate identification of mixtures of acetone, methanol and ethanol vapors is demonstrated with a QFTIR spectrometer. We achieved this breakthrough by using a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms in order to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential optical absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Identical Mean Estimation: Efficient Algorithms and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate quantum algorithms and lower bounds for mean estimation given query access to non-identically distributed samples. On the one hand, we give quantum mean estimators with quadratic quantum speed-up given samples from different bounded or sub-Gaussian random variables. On the other hand, we prove that, in general, it is impossible for any quantum algorithm to achieve quadratic speed-up over the number of classical samples needed to estimate the mean $\mu$, where the samples come from different random variables with mean close to $\mu$. Technically, our quantum algorithms reduce bounded and sub-Gaussian random variables to the Bernoulli case, and use an uncomputation trick to overcome the challenge that direct amplitude estimation does not work with non-identical query access. Our quantum query lower bounds are established by simulating non-identical oracles by parallel oracles, and also by an adversarial method with non-identical oracles. Both results pave the way for proving quantum query lower bounds with non-identical oracles in general, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation is an emerging technology with important potential for solving certain problems pivotal in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper introduces an efficient quantum protocol for the explicit construction of the block-encoding for an important class of Hamiltonians. Using the Schrodingerisation technique -- which converts non-conservative PDEs into conservative ones -- this particular class of Hamiltonians is shown to be sufficient for simulating any linear partial differential equations that have coefficients which are polynomial functions. The class of Hamiltonians consist of discretisations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This construction is explicit and leverages minimal one- and two-qubit operations. The explicit construction of this block-encoding forms a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for this Hamiltonian. The proposed algorithm exhibits polynomial scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, suggesting an exponential speedup over classical finite-difference methods. This work provides an important foundation for building explicit and efficient quantum circuits for solving partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>High-Field Microscale NMR Spectroscopy with NV Centers in Dipolarly-Coupled Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond-based quantum sensors have enabled high-resolution NMR spectroscopy at the microscale in scenarios where fast molecular motion averages out dipolar interactions among target nuclei. However, in samples with low-diffusion, ubiquitous dipolar couplings challenge the extraction of relevant spectroscopic information. In this work we present a protocol that enables the scanning of nuclear spins in dipolarly-coupled samples at high magnetic fields with a sensor based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensembles. Our protocol is based on the synchronized delivery of radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) radiation to eliminate couplings among nuclei in the scanned sample and to efficiently extract target energy-shifts from the sample's magnetization dynamics. In addition, the method is designed to operate at high magnetic fields leading to a larger sample thermal polarization, thus to an increased NMR signal. The precision of our method is ultimately limited by the coherence time of the sample, allowing for accurate identification of relevant energy shifts in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Machine Learning Generalization to Significantly Speed-up Quantum Compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing numerical optimizers deployed in quantum compilers use expensive $\mathcal{O}(4^n)$ matrix-matrix operations. Inspired by recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML), QFactor-Sample replaces matrix-matrix operations with simpler $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ circuit simulations on a set of sample inputs. The simpler the circuit, the lower the number of required input samples. We validate QFactor-Sample on a large set of circuits and discuss its hyperparameter tuning. When incorporated in the BQSKit quantum compiler and compared against a state-of-the-art domain-specific optimizer, We demonstrate improved scalability and a reduction in compile time, achieving an average speedup factor of {\bf 69} for circuits with more than 8 qubits. We also discuss how improved numerical optimization affects the dynamics of partitioning-based compilation schemes, which allow a trade-off between compilation speed and solution quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated a two-photon interfering technique based on polarization-resolved measurements for the simultaneous estimation with the maximum sensitivity achievable in nature of multiple parameters associated with the polarization state of two interfering photonic qubits. This estimation is done by exploiting a novel interferometry technique based on polarization-resolved two-photon interference. We show the experimental feasibility and accuracy of this technique even when a limited number of sampling measurements is employed. This work is relevant for the development of quantum technologies with photonic qubits and sheds light on the physics at the interface between multiphoton interference, boson sampling, multi-parameter quantum sensing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Genuine $k$-partite correlations and entanglement in the ground state of the Dicke model for interacting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of correlations among subsystems is essential for both the understanding of critical phenomena and for performing quantum information tasks. However, the majority of correlation measures are restricted to bipartitions due to the inherent challenges associated with handling multiple partitions and subsystems. To address this, we investigate Genuine Multipartite Correlations (GMC) of the Dicke model with interacting qubits. This method allows for the precise quantification of correlations within each subpart of the system, as well as for the percentage contribution of each GMC of order $k$. Most importantly, we show that GMC signal both first- and second-order quantum phase transitions present in the model. Furthermore, we employ Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to detect genuine multipartite entanglement, since the GMC encompass both classical and quantum correlations. Ultimately, we compare the Dicke model with interacting qubits to spin-centers in solids interacting with a quantum field of magnons to demonstrate a potential experimental realization of this generalized Dicke model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency $1/f^\alpha$ charge noise significantly hinders the performance of voltage-controlled spin qubits in quantum dots. Here, we utilize fractional calculus to design voltage control pulses yielding the highest average fidelities for noisy quantum gate operations. We focus specifically on the exponential voltage control of the exchange interaction generating two-spin $\mathrm{SWAP}^k$ gates. When stationary charge noise is the dominant source of gate infidelity, we derive that the optimal exchange pulse is long and weak, with the broad shape of the symmetric beta distribution function with parameter $1-\alpha/2$. The common practice of making exchange pulses fast and high-amplitude still remains beneficial in the case of strongly nonstationary noise dynamics, modeled as fractional Brownian motion. The proposed methods are applicable to the characterization and optimization of quantum gate operations in various voltage-controlled qubit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation becomes more challenging as the underlying unitary becomes more oscillatory. In such cases, an algorithm with commutator scaling and a weak dependence, such as logarithmic, on the derivatives of the Hamiltonian is desired. We introduce a new time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation algorithm based on the Magnus series expansion that exhibits both features. Importantly, when applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, we prove that the commutator in the second-order algorithm leads to a surprising fourth-order superconvergence, with an error preconstant independent of the number of spatial grids. This extends the qHOP algorithm [An, Fang, Lin, Quantum 2022] based on first-order Magnus expansion, and the proof of superconvergence is based on semiclassical analysis that is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future physical behavior through the limited theoretical simulation data available is an emerging research paradigm resulted by the integration of artificial intelligence technology and quantum physics. In this work, the charge-transport(CT) behavior was forecasted over a long time by a deep learning model, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with error threshold training method in the photosynthesis II reaction center (PSII-RC). The theoretical simulation data within 8 fs was fed to the modified LSTM network for training, which brings out a distinct prediction with difference of $10^{-4}$ orders of magnitude over a long time period compared to the collection time for training sets. The results indicate the potential of employing LSTM to reveal the physics governing CT in addition to quantum physical methods. The implications of this work warrant further investigation to fully elucidate the scope and efficacy of LSTM for advancing our understanding of photosynthesis at the molecular scale.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground and Excited States via Single Reference Coupled-Cluster Theory and Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Remarkably, our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to explain the emergence of an intermediate gapless spin liquid phase (IGP) in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in an externally applied magnetic field, sandwiched between the well-known gapped chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the gapped partially polarized (PP) phase. We propose in moderate fields $\pi$-fluxes nucleate in the ground state and can trap Majorana zero modes. As these fluxes proliferate with increasing field, the Majorana zero modes overlap creating an emergent Majorana metallic state with a `Fermi surface' at zero energy. We further show that the Majorana spectral function captures the dynamical spin and dimer correlations obtained by the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) ansatz. We discuss the implications of our results for candidate Kitaev materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Anisotropy on 3-Qubit Antiferromagnetic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the anisotropic effects on a system of three qubits with chain and ring topology, described by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg XXX model subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field. We explore the Stirling and Otto cycles and find that easy-axis anisotropy significantly enhances engine efficiency across all cases. At low temperatures, the ring configuration outperforms the chain on both work and efficiency during the Stirling cycle. Additionally, in both topologies, the Stirling cycle achieves Carnot efficiency with finite work at quantum critical points. In contrast, the quasistatic Otto engine also reaches Carnot efficiency at these points but yields no useful work. Notably, the Stirling cycle exhibits all thermal operational regimes engine, refrigerator, heater, and accelerator unlike the quasistatic Otto cycle, which functions only as an engine or refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECC from the perspective of TQFT, Part II: QECCs as spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption lan- guage for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quan- tum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of few fermionic impurities immersed in two-dimensional boson droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unravel the ground state properties and emergent non-equilibrium dynamics of a mixture consisting of a few spin-polarized fermions embedded in a two-dimensional bosonic quantum droplet. For an increasingly attractive droplet-fermion interaction we find a transition from a spatially delocalized fermion configuration to a state where the fermions are highly localized and isolated. This process is accompanied by the rise of induced fermion-fermion interactions mediated by the droplet. Additionally, for increasing attractive droplet-fermion coupling, undulations in the droplet density occur in the vicinity of the fermions manifesting the back-action of the latter. Following interaction quenches from strong attractive to weaker droplet-fermion couplings reveals the spontaneous nucleation of complex excitation patterns in the fermion density such as ring and cross shaped structures. These stem from the enhanced interference of the fermions that remain trapped within the droplet, which emulates, to a good degree, an effective potential for the fermions. The non-negligible back-action of the droplet manifests itself in the fact that the effective potential predictions are less accurate at the level of the many-body wave function. Our results provide a paradigm for physics beyond the reduced single-component droplet model, unveiling the role of back-action in droplets and the effect of induced mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <title>All-fiber, near-infrared, laser system at 780nm for atom cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold neutral atoms are a promising "architecture" for novel and innovative quantum technology applications. These range from quantum sensors for magnetic fields, interferometers for gravimetry measurements, to quantum computing and simulations. Within this technological landscape, reliable laser systems are crucial in order to cool and manipulate atoms efficiently. We present the design, experimental realization and characterization of a relatively simple, compact, and economical laser system for quantum technology applications. It operates at 780 nm in order to work with Rubidium atoms, and it is entirely based on fiber components. This improves its reliability, and makes it less complex and more versatile with respect to a free-space system.
  In order to cut costs, we take advantage of already available commercial fiber devices at 1560 nm: due to their ubiquity in telecom applications they are in fact cheap and standardized. To operate at Rubidium wavelengths the system employs Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) of the 1560 nm infrared radiation: two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm (one for cooling, one for repumping) are combined, amplified in an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), and frequency-doubled in a Periodically-Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal.
  We characterize the amplitude stability of the lasers, their frequency noise, and the SHG efficiency. The measured features (rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s; linewidths well below 1 MHz) make our system a suitable candidate for applications in quantum sensors and atom interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a block encoding method for mapping discrete subgroups to qubits on a quantum computer. This method is applicable to general discrete groups, including crystal-like subgroups such as $\mathbb{BI}$ of $SU(2)$ and $\mathbb{V}$ of $SU(3)$. We detail the construction of primitive gates -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier gate -- utilizing this encoding method for $\mathbb{BT}$ and for the first time $\mathbb{BI}$ group. We also provide resource estimations to extract the gluon viscosity. The inversion gates for $\mathbb{BT}$ and $\mathbb{BI}$ are benchmarked on the $\texttt{Baiwang}$ quantum computer with estimated fidelities of $40^{+5}_{-4}\%$ and $4^{+5}_{-3}\%$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography explains quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.05294v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a new principle inspired by quantum tomography rather than from Born's rule, this paper gives a self-contained deductive approach to quantum mechanics and quantum measurement. A suggestive notion for what constitutes a quantum detector and for the behavior of its responses leads to a logically impeccable definition of measurement. Applications to measurement schemes for optical states, position measurements and particle tracks demonstrate the applicability to complex realistic experiments without any idealization.
  The various forms of quantum tomography for quantum states, quantum detectors, quantum processes, and quantum instruments are discussed. The traditional dynamical and spectral properties of quantum mechanics are derived from a continuum limit of quantum processes, giving the Lindblad equation for the density operator of a mixing quantum system and the Schr\"odinger equation for the state vector of a pure, nonmixing quantum system. Normalized density operators are shown to play the role of quantum phase space variables, in complete analogy to the classical phase space variables position and momentum. A slight idealization of the measurement process leads to the notion of quantum fields, whose smeared quantum expectations emerge as reproducible properties of regions of space accessible to measurements.
  The new approach is closer to actual practice than the traditional foundations. It is more general, and therefore more powerful. It is simpler and less technical than the traditional approach, and the standard tools of quantum mechanics are not difficult to derive. This makes the new approach suitable for introductory courses on quantum mechanics.
  A variety of quotes from the literature illuminate the formal exposition with historical and philosophical aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I argue that the rules of unitary quantum mechanics imply that observers who will themselves be subject to measurements in a linear combination of macroscopic states (``cat" measurements) cannot make reliable predictions on the results of experiments performed after such measurements. This lifts the inconsistency in the interpretation of quantum mechanics recently identified by Frauchiger and Renner. The Born rules for calculating the probability of outcomes and for communicating with other observers do not generally apply for cat-measured observers, nor can they generally be amended to incorporate upcoming cat measurements. Quantum mechanical rules completed with these conditions become fully consistent.</description>

Abstract: Frequency instabilities are a major source of errors in quantum devices. This study investigates frequency fluctuations in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator, where reflection coefficients of 14 SAW modes are measured simultaneously for more than seven hours. We report two distinct noise characteristics. Multimode frequency noise caused by interactions with two-level system (TLS) defects shows significant degrees of correlations that diminish with increased detuning. This finding agrees with the current understanding of the parasitic TLS behavior as one of the dominant noise sources in quantum devices. In addition to the TLS-induced noise, we observe strong anomalous frequency fluctuations with slow, anti-correlated dynamics. These noise bursts resemble signatures of cosmic radiation observed in superconducting quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We provide the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, and its induced quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy and quantum R\'enyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence with R\'enyi parameter in the interval $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization of photonic quantum circuits in phase and Fock space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06069v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to design and optimize generic photonic quantum circuits composed of Gaussian objects (pure and mixed Gaussian states, Gaussian unitaries, Gaussian channels, Gaussian measurements) as well as non-Gaussian effects such as photon-number-resolving measurements. In this framework, we parametrize a phase space representation of Gaussian objects using elements of the symplectic group (or the unitary or orthogonal group in special cases), and then we transform it into the Fock representation using a single linear recurrence relation that computes the Fock amplitudes of any Gaussian object recursively. We also compute the gradient of the Fock amplitudes with respect to phase space parameters by differentiating through the recurrence relation. We can then use Riemannian optimization on the symplectic group to optimize M-mode Gaussian objects, avoiding the need to commit to particular realizations in terms of fundamental gates. This allows us to "mod out" all the different gate-level implementations of the same circuit, which now can be chosen after the optimization has completed. This can be especially useful when looking to answer general questions, such as bounding the value of a property over a class of states or transformations, or when one would like to worry about hardware constraints separately from the circuit optimization step. Finally, we make our framework extendable to non-Gaussian objects that can be written as linear combinations of Gaussian ones, by explicitly computing the change in global phase when states undergo Gaussian transformations. We implemented all of these methods in the freely available open-source library MrMustard, which we use in three examples to optimize the 216-mode interferometer in Borealis, and 2- and 3-modes circuits (with Fock measurements) to produce cat states and cubic phase states.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a novel MIR methane sensor shifting measurement wavelength to SWIR (1.55$\mu$m) by using non-linear interferometry. The technique exploits the interference effects seen in three-wave mixing when pump, signal, and idler modes make a double pass through a nonlinear crystal. The method allows sensing at wavelengths where detectors are poor ($&gt;$3$\mu$m) and detection at wavelengths where photon counting sensitivity can be achieved. In a first experimental demonstration, we measured a small methane concentration inside a gas cell with high precision. This interferometer can be built in a compact design for field operations and potentially enable the detection of low concentrations of methane at up to 100m range. Signal-to-noise ratio calculations show that the method can outperform existing short wavelength ($\sim$1.65$\mu$m) integrated path differential absorption direct sensing at high ($&gt;$$10^{-4}$) non-linear gain.</description>

Abstract: We propose a class of randomized quantum algorithms for the task of sampling from matrix functions, without the use of quantum block encodings or any other coherent oracle access to the matrix elements. As such, our use of qubits is purely algorithmic, and no additional qubits are required for quantum data structures. Our algorithms start from a classical data structure in which the matrix of interest is specified in the Pauli basis. For $N\times N$ Hermitian matrices, the space cost is $\log(N)+1$ qubits and depending on the structure of the matrices, the gate complexity can be comparable to state-of-the-art methods that use quantum data structures of up to size $O(N^2)$, when considering equivalent end-to-end problems. Within our framework, we present a quantum linear system solver that allows one to sample properties of the solution vector, as well as algorithms for sampling properties of ground states and Gibbs states of Hamiltonians. As a concrete application, we combine these sub-routines to present a scheme for calculating Green's functions of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>NoRA: A Tensor Network Ansatz for Volume-Law Entangled Equilibrium States of Highly Connected Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16946v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the ground state structure of quantum models with all-to-all interactions such as mean-field quantum spin glass models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we propose a tensor network architecture which can accomodate volume law entanglement and a large ground state degeneracy. We call this architecture the non-local renormalization ansatz (NoRA) because it can be viewed as a generalization of MERA, DMERA, and branching MERA networks with the constraints of spatial locality removed. We argue that the architecture is potentially expressive enough to capture the entanglement and complexity of the ground space of the SYK model, thus making it a suitable variational ansatz, but we leave a detailed study of SYK to future work. We further explore the architecture in the special case in which the tensors are random Clifford gates. Here the architecture can be viewed as the encoding map of a random stabilizer code. We introduce a family of codes inspired by the SYK model which can be chosen to have constant rate and linear distance at the cost of some high weight stabilizers. We also comment on potential similarities between this code family and the approximate code formed from the SYK ground space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information processing, quantum or classical, relies on channels transforming multiple input states to different corresponding outputs. Previous research has established bounds on the thermodynamic resources required for such operations, but no protocols have been specified for their optimal implementation. For the insightful case of qubits, we here develop explicit protocols to transform two states in an energetically optimal manner. We first prove conditions on the feasibility of carrying out such transformations at all, and then quantify the achievable work extraction. Our results uncover a fundamental incompatibility between the thermodynamic ideal of slow, quasistatic processes and the information-theoretic requirement to preserve distinguishablity between different possible output states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state reconstruction using Neural Quantum States has been proposed as a viable tool to reduce quantum shot complexity in practical applications, and its advantage over competing techniques has been shown in numerical experiments focusing mainly on the noiseless case. In this work, we numerically investigate the performance of different quantum state reconstruction techniques for mixed states: the finite-temperature Ising model. We show how to systematically reduce the quantum resource requirement of the algorithms by applying variance reduction techniques. Then, we compare the two leading neural quantum state encodings of the state, namely, the Neural Density Operator and the positive operator-valued measurement representation, and illustrate their different performance as the mixedness of the target state varies. We find that certain encodings are more efficient in different regimes of mixedness and point out the need for designing more efficient encodings in terms of both classical and quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum correlations of a system of two quantum dots with F\"oster interaction ({\Gamma}) in a microcavity with strongly coupled dissipation and a single mode of the electromagnetic field and driven by a laser pulse were studied theoretically, using the formalism of the master equation in Lindbland form. The energy eigenvalues of the system were studied as a function of detuning for the first and second excitation varieties. Concurrence (CC), formation entanglement (EoF),mutual information (I) and quantum discord (Q) are studied as a function of time considering different values of F\"oster coupling, varying the pump times of the simulated laser pulse and pulse intensity. We found a discrepancy between EoF and CC as entanglement quantifiers, noting that concurrence reaches much higher values than EoF; so concurrence can indicate results that are well above the EoF. The presence of the F\"oster interaction favors that the quantum discord is the dominant correlation in the system, which indicates that the system maintains quantum correlations even when the entanglement of the system has disappeared, but that it is affected by the increase in the laser pump time</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal matrix decomposition for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer</title>

Abstract: The construction of quantum circuits to simulate Hamiltonian evolution is central to many quantum algorithms. State-of-the-art circuits are based on oracles whose implementation is often omitted, and the complexity of the algorithm is estimated by counting oracle queries. However, in practical applications, an oracle implementation contributes a large constant factor to the overall complexity of the algorithm. The key finding of this work is the efficient procedure for representation of a tridiagonal matrix in the Pauli basis, which allows one to construct a Hamiltonian evolution circuit without the use of oracles. The procedure represents a general tridiagonal matrix $2^n \times 2^n$ by systematically determining all Pauli strings present in the decomposition, dividing them into commuting subsets. The efficiency is in the number of commuting subsets $O(n)$. The method is demonstrated using the one-dimensional wave equation, verifying numerically that the gate complexity as function of the number of qubits is lower than the oracle based approach for $n &lt; 15$ and requires half the number of qubits. This method is applicable to other Hamiltonians based on the tridiagonal matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a transformative technology. Yet, its promised advantages rely on efficiently translating quantum operations into viable physical realizations. In this work, we use generative machine learning models, specifically denoising diffusion models (DMs), to facilitate this transformation. Leveraging text-conditioning, we steer the model to produce desired quantum operations within gate-based quantum circuits. Notably, DMs allow to sidestep during training the exponential overhead inherent in the classical simulation of quantum dynamics -- a consistent bottleneck in preceding ML techniques. We demonstrate the model's capabilities across two tasks: entanglement generation and unitary compilation. The model excels at generating new circuits and supports typical DM extensions such as masking and editing to, for instance, align the circuit generation to the constraints of the targeted quantum device. Given their flexibility and generalization abilities, we envision DMs as pivotal in quantum circuit synthesis, enhancing both practical applications but also insights into theoretical quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a faithful translation of a two-player quantum Morra game, which builds on previous work by including the classical game as a special case. We propose a natural deformation of the game in the quantum regime in which Alice has a winning advantage, breaking the balance of the classical game. A Nash equilibrium can be found in some cases by employing a pure strategy, which is impossible in the classical game where a mixed strategy is always required. We prepared our states using photonic qubits on a linear optics setup, with an average deviation less than 2% with respect to the measured outcome probabilities. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the quantum Morra game to the study of quantum information and communication.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure. Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per spin reaches $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial state of a quantum system can significantly influence its future dynamics, especially in non-Markovain quantum processes due to the environmental memory effects. Based on a previous work of ours, we propose a method to quantify the memory effects of a non-Markovian quantum process conditioned on a particular system initial state. We apply our method to study the early-time dynamics of a superradiance model where $N$ atoms (the system) interacting with a single-mode vacuum cavity (the environment) with several types of initial states. We find that the value of the memory effects in the early-time regime is half the environmental photon number for the (dephased) Dicke states. Besides, the memory effects, the environmental photon number and the degree of superradiance can be simultaneously enhanced by the coherence or entanglement of some initial states. In our study, the transitions from non-superradiant initial states to superradiant ones are always accompanied by the enhancement of memory effects, showing the importance of memory effects in superradiance.</description>

Abstract: Leggett-Garg inequalities place bounds on the temporal correlations of a system based on the principles of macroscopic realism $\textit{per se}$ and noninvasive measurability. Their conventional formulation relies on the ensemble-averaged products of observables measured at different instants of time. However, a complete description that enables a precise understanding and captures all physically relevant features requires the study of probability distributions associated with noncommuting observables. In this article, we propose a scheme to describe the dynamics of generic $N$-level quantum systems ("qudits") via a probability vector representation of the Schr\"odinger equation and define a precise notion of no-signaling in time (NSIT) for the probability distributions of noncommuting observables. This provides a systematic way of identifying the interferences responsible for nonclassical behavior. In addition, we introduce an interference witness measure to quantify violations of NSIT for arbitrary general probabilistic states. For single-qubit systems, we pinpoint the pivotal relation that establishes a connection between the disturbance of observables incurred during a measurement and the resulting NSIT violation. For large-$N$-systems where a manual determination is infeasible, the classification of states as either NSIT-conforming or NSIT-violating may be performed by a machine learning algorithm. We present a proof-of-principle implementation of such an algorithm in which the classifier function is prepared via supervised learning using pseudo-randomly generated training data sets comprised of states whose corresponding classifications are known $\textit{a priori}$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum operations by utilizing the underlying geometric phases produced in physical systems are favoured due to its potential robustness. When a system in a non-degenerate eigenstate undergoes an adiabatically cyclic evolution dominated by its Hamiltonian, it will get a geometric phase, referred to as the Berry Phase. While a non-adiabatically cyclic evolution produces an Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. The two types of Abelian geometric phases are extended to the non-Abelian cases, where the phase factors become matrix-valued and the transformations associated with different loops are non-commutable. Abelian and non-Abelian (holonomic) operations are prevalent in discrete variable systems, whose limited (say, two) energy levels, form the qubit. While their developments in continuous systems have also been investigated, mainly due to that, bosonic modes (in, such as, cat states) with large Hilbert spaces, provide potential advantages in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we propose a feasible scheme to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum logic operations in continuous variable systems with cat codes. We construct arbitrary single-qubit (two-qubit) gates with the combination of single- and two-photon drivings applied to a Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) (the coupled KPOs). Our scheme relaxes the requirements of the previously proposed quantum geometric operation strategies in continuous variable systems, providing an effective way for quantum control.</description>

Abstract: Self-testing identifies quantum states and correlations that exhibit nonlocality, distinguishing them, up to local transformations, from other quantum states. Due to their strong nonlocality, it is known that all graph states can be self-tested in the standard setting - where parties are not allowed to communicate. Recently it has been shown that graph states display nonlocal correlations even when bounded classical communication on the underlying graph is permitted, a feature that has found applications in proving a circuit-depth separation between classical and quantum computing. In this work, we develop self testing in the framework of bounded classical communication, and we show that certain graph states can be robustly self-tested even allowing for communication. In particular, we provide an explicit self-test for the circular graph state and the honeycomb cluster state - the latter known to be a universal resource for measurement based quantum computation. Since communication generally obstructs self-testing of graph states, we further provide a procedure to robustly self-test any graph state from larger ones that exhibit nonlocal correlations in the communication scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum distillation is a modern technology to decrease the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem by coherent system dynamics. Here we propose an active quantum distillation protocol, in which a bang-bang theme is applied to actively control the coherent dynamics of our system in order to obtain a subsystem with the von Neumann entropy as low as possible. For a bipartite Bosonic system, we derive the analytical expression of lower bound of the entropy of subsystem under any unitary transformation with conservation of particles. The lower bound is validated by numerical simulations on the Bose-Hubbard model, where the coherent evolution is controlled by tuning one interaction term of the Hamiltonian. Our protocol can be used to decrease the entropy of one subsystem lower than the total bipartite state and increase the number of Bosons or only distill out very few Bosons in the subsystem.</description>

      <title>On verifiable quantum advantage with peaked circuit sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a decade after its proposal, the idea of using quantum computers to sample hard distributions has remained a key path to demonstrating quantum advantage. Yet a severe drawback remains: verification seems to require classical computation exponential in the system size, $n$. As an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new candidate for quantum advantage experiments with otherwise random "peaked circuits", i.e., quantum circuits whose outputs have high concentrations on a computational basis state. Naturally, the heavy output string can be used for classical verification. In this work, we analytically and numerically study an explicit model of peaked circuits, in which $\tau_r$ layers of uniformly random gates are augmented by $\tau_p$ layers of gates that are optimized to maximize peakedness. We show that getting $1/\text{poly}(n)$ peakedness from such circuits requires $\tau_{p} = \Omega((\tau_r/n)^{0.19})$ with overwhelming probability. However, we also give numerical evidence that nontrivial peakedness is possible in this model -- decaying exponentially with the number of qubits, but more than can be explained by any approximation where the output of a random quantum circuit is treated as a Haar-random state. This suggests that these peaked circuits have the potential for future verifiable quantum advantage experiments. Our work raises numerous open questions about random peaked circuits, including how to generate them efficiently, and whether they can be distinguished from fully random circuits in classical polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog Counterdiabatic Quantum Optimization with Trapped Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hardware-specific, problem-dependent digital-analog quantum algorithm of a counterdiabatic quantum dynamics tailored for optimization problems. Specifically, we focus on trapped-ion architectures, taking advantage from global M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates as the analog interactions complemented by digital gates, both of which are available in the state-of-the-art technologies. We show an optimal configuration of analog blocks and digital steps leading to a substantial reduction in circuit depth compared to the purely digital approach. This implies that, using the proposed encoding, we can address larger optimization problem instances, requiring more qubits, while preserving the coherence time of current devices. Furthermore, we study the minimum gate fidelity required by the analog blocks to outperform the purely digital simulation, finding that it is below the best fidelity reported in the literature. To validate the performance of the digital-analog encoding, we tackle the maximum independent set problem, showing that it requires fewer resources compared to the digital case. This hybrid co-design approach paves the way towards quantum advantage for efficient solutions of quantum optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of errors in a CNOT between surface code patches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As current experiments already realize small quantum circuits on error corrected qubits, it is important to fully understand the effect of physical errors on the logical error channels of these fault-tolerant circuits. Here, we investigate a lattice-surgery-based CNOT operation between two surface code patches under phenomenological error models. (i) For two-qubit logical Pauli measurements -- the elementary building block of the CNOT -- we optimize the number of stabilizer measurement rounds, usually taken equal to $d$, the size (code distance) of each patch. We find that the optimal number can be greater or smaller than $d$, depending on the rate of physical and readout errors, and the separation between the code patches. (ii) We fully characterize the two-qubit logical error channel of the lattice-surgery-based CNOT. We find a symmetry of the CNOT protocol, that results in a symmetry of the logical error channel. We also find that correlations between X and Z errors on the logical level are suppressed under minimum weight decoding.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Exact Synthesis of Multiqutrit Clifford-Cyclotomic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the unitary matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+$T$, or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_k]$, where $k$ is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and $\zeta_k$ is a primitive $2^k$-th root of unity. In this paper, we establish the analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ by extending the classical qutrit gates $X$, $CX$, and Toffoli with the Hadamard gate $H$ and the single-qutrit gate $T_k=\mathrm{diag}(1,\omega_k, \omega_k^2)$, where $\omega_k$ is a primitive $3^k$-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when $k=1$, and to the qutrit Clifford+$T_k$ gate set when $k&gt;1$. We then prove that a $3^n\times 3^n$ unitary matrix $U$ can be represented by an $n$-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ if and only if the entries of $U$ lie in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/3,\omega_k]$.</description>

      <title>High-throughput assessment of defect-nuclear spin register controllability for quantum memory applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum memories play a key role in facilitating tasks within quantum networks and quantum information processing, including secure communications, advanced quantum sensing, and distributed quantum computing. Progress in characterizing large nuclear spin registers coupled to defect electronic spins has been significant, but selecting memory qubits remains challenging due to the multitude of possible assignments. Numerical simulations for evaluating entangling gate fidelities encounter obstacles, restricting research to small registers, while experimental investigations are time-consuming and often limited to well-understood samples. Here we present an efficient methodology for systematically assessing the controllability of defect systems coupled to nuclear spin registers. We showcase the approach by investigating the generation of entanglement links between defects in SiC and randomly selected sets of nuclear spins within the two-species ($^{13}$C and $^{29}$Si) nuclear register. We quantify the performance of entangling gate operations and present the achievable gate fidelities, considering both the size of the register and the presence of unwanted nuclear spins. We find that some control sequences perform better than others depending on the number of target versus bath nuclei. This efficient approach is a guide for both experimental investigation and engineering, facilitating the high-throughput exploration of suitable defect systems for quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Conditions for enhancement of chemical reactions in gas phase inside a dark cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communications harness quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to enhance information transfer between remote nodes. Coherent quantum communications, essential for phase-based quantum internet architecture, require optical coherence among nodes and typically involve single-photon interference. Challenges like preserving optical coherence and integrating advanced single-photon detectors have impeded their deployment in existing telecommunication networks. This study introduces innovative approaches to the architecture and techniques supporting coherent quantum communications, marking their first successful integration within a commercial telecom infrastructure between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany. Employing the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution protocol, we achieved encryption key distribution at 110 bit/s over 254 km. This system features measurement-device-independent properties and non-cryogenically cooled detectors, and represents the first effective quantum repeater implementation on telecom infrastructure, the longest practical quantum key distribution deployment to date, and validates the feasibility of a phase-based quantum internet architecture.</description>

Abstract: We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves $N$ molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Discrete orthogonality relations for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete orthogonality relations hold for all the orthogonal polynomials obeying three term recurrence relations. We show that they also hold for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, which are new orthogonal polynomials obtained by deforming these classical orthogonal polynomials. The discrete orthogonality relations could be considered as more encompassing characterisation of orthogonal polynomials than the three term recurrence relations. As the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials start at a positive degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}\ge1$, the three term recurrence relations are broken. The extra $\ell_{\mathcal D}$ `lower degree polynomials', which are necessary for the discrete orthogonality relations, are identified. The corresponding Christoffel numbers are determined. The main results are obtained by the blow-up analysis of the second order differential operators governing the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials around the zeros of these polynomials at a degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}+\mathcal{N}$. %changed The discrete orthogonality relations are shown to hold for another group of `new' orthogonal polynomials called Krein-Adler polynomials based on the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states have garnered considerable attention due to their intriguing properties, most notably Wick's theorem. Expanding upon the work of Balian and Brezin, who generalized properties of fermionic Gaussian operators and states, we further extend their findings to incorporate Gaussian operators with a linear component. Leveraging a technique introduced by Colpa, we streamline the analysis and present a comprehensive extension of the Balian-Brezin decomposition (BBD) to encompass exponentials involving linear terms. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian states featuring a linear part and derive corresponding overlap formulas. Additionally, we generalize Wick's theorem to encompass scenarios involving linear terms, facilitating the expression of generic expectation values in relation to one and two-point correlation functions. We also provide a brief commentary on the applicability of the BB decomposition in addressing the BCH (Zassenhaus) formulas within the $\mathfrak{so}(N)$ Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for generating limit cycle (LC) oscillations by coupling a linear bosonic mode to a dissipative nonlinear bosonic mode. By analyzing the stability matrix, we show that LCs arise due to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We find that the existence of LCs is independent of the sign of the effective nonlinear interaction. The LC phase can be classified as a continuous time crystal (CTC), if it emerges in a many-body system. The bosonic model can be realised in three-level systems interacting with a quantised light mode as realised in atom-cavity systems. Using such a platform, we experimentally observe LCs for the first time in an atom-cavity system with attractive optical pump lattice, thereby confirming our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Matter-wave interferometers with trapped strongly interacting Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement two types of matter-wave interferometers using trapped Bose-condensed Feshbach molecules, from weak to strong interactions. In each case, we focus on investigating interaction effects and their implications for the performance. In the Ramsey-type interferometer where interference between the two motional quantum states in an optical lattice is observed, interparticle interactions are found to induce energy shifts in the states. Consequently, this results in a reduction of the interferometer frequency and introduces a phase shift during the lattice pulses used for state manipulation. Furthermore, nonuniformity leads to dephasing and collisional effects contribute to the degradation of contrast. In the Michelson-type interferometer, where matter waves are spatially split and recombined in a waveguide, interference is observed in the presence of significant interaction, however coherence degrades with increasing interaction strength. Notably, coherence is also observed in thermal clouds, indicating the white-light nature of the implemented Michelson-type interferometer.</description>
