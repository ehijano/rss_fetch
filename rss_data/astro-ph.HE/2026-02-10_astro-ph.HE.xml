      <title>A NICER view of the corona through time-dependent Comptonization of the quasi-periodic oscillations in nine black-hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of the corona geometry in nine black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) using archival data from NICER. We identify 171 observations exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) across various spectral states and model the time-averaged energy spectra of the source, as well as the energy-dependent rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO, with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompthdk. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the corona size and feedback fraction during outbursts. By using the power color hue diagnostics, we identify different spectral states, and observe that the QPO frequency increases from $\sim$0.1 Hz to $\sim$10 Hz in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states (LHS and HIMS), and remains approximately constant at 4--5~Hz in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS). The corona size shows significant evolution: the corona is large ($\sim10^4$--$10^5$ km) in the LHS, contracts rapidly to $\sim10^3$ km in the HIMS, and exhibits a flare-like expansion near the HIMS-to-SIMS transition. In the SIMS and high-soft state (HSS), the corona becomes compact and stable (4000--8000~km). The feedback fraction of the corona photons increases during the periods in which the corona contracts and decreases during the periods in which the corona expands, indicating a change of the disk-corona coupling. Our results are consistent with previous QPO-based studies using vKompthdk on some individual sources. This work, however, provides the first view of the coronal evolution across outbursts for a diverse BHXRB sample, offering critical insights into coronal behavior as a function of the spectral state of the source.</description>

      <title>Imprints of gravitational waves from magnetar spindown in GRB X-ray afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that newborn magnetars are considered potential central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), there is strong motivation to identify gravitational wave (GW) signatures within GRB samples. If the X-ray afterglow of a GRB is powered by a magnetar, and the initial spindown of the magnetar is dominated by the GW radiation induced by $r$-mode instability or magnetic-field-induced deformation, the decay of the X-ray flux would record the information of the GW radiation. We find that GRB 130603B potentially represents a rare and precious case where the spindown of the central magnetar is dominated in-turn by $r$-mode and magnetic distortion-induced GW radiation. By fitting the X-ray light curve of GRB 130603B in this model, we obtain the initial spin period of magnetar $\sim 5.3\times 10^{-4}$ s, the effective dipole magnetic field strength $\sim 5.2\times 10^{14}$ G, the ellipticity of the magnetar $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-4}$, and the amplitude of $r$-mode oscillation $\sim3.3\times 10^{-2}$. It may serve as a reliable approach for investigating neutron star physics by comparing the parameters estimated using the method presented in this manuscript with those obtained from future GW observations.</description>

      <title>FPIC: a new Particle-In-Cell code for stationary and axisymmetric black-hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical positronium and Dicke superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance is a fascinating phenomenon in which a large number of atoms cooperate to produce a brief and very intense burst of spontaneous emission. This phenomenon has been well studied in the laboratory, but its astrophysical aspects have only recently attracted the attention of a small number of researchers. Since the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance is relatively little known to the wider astrophysical community, we provide a fairly detailed review of its elementary theory in the appendix and speculate on the significance of superradiance for astrophysical hydrogen and positronium, given the abundant formation of the latter near the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Two-component $\gamma$-Ray Structure from the CR Sources Within Dense Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed that several cosmic ray (CR) sources themselves exhibit pronounced double power-law features in their radiation spectra. Combined with the phenomenon of two-component structure in the observed CR energy spectrum supported by multi-messenger data, this raises a fundamental question: can the two-component structure of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the double power-law feature of the gamma-ray radiation energy spectrum from supernova remnants be understood within a unified picture? In this study, we propose a two-component model that incorporates the re-acceleration of background ``sea" CR particles by astrophysical sources to systematically explain the formation of double power-law spectra within those sources. Our model successfully reproduces the gamma-ray observations of multiple CR sources. The results support that double power-law structures may be a generic feature of Galactic CR sources within crushed clouds. This work offers a new theoretical perspective on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, and its predictions may be further tested with future observations of a larger sample of CR sources.</description>

      <title>A Multi-messenger Search for a Nearby Microquasar Contributor to the Cosmic Ray Knee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LHAASO has detected five microquasars with high confidence, which are associated with SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070, and Cygnus X-1, respectively. Except for Cygnus X-1, the maximum energies of gamma-ray photons emitted from these sources all exceed 100 TeV, strongly suggesting that microquasars are capable of accelerating cosmic-ray particles to energies above the PeV range. This work investigates the origin of the cosmic-ray knee region based on gamma-ray observational data from the aforementioned sources, combined with cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy observations. Calculations indicate that these known sources contribute negligibly to the cosmic-ray knee region. However, further joint analysis reveals that a single microquasar located in a region approximately on the 2.6 kiloparsec scale in the anti-Galactic center direction can reasonably reproduce the observed cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy features detected near Earth. We propose that this region may host one or several unidentified microquasars or similar systems, whose accelerated cosmic rays could dominate the observational characteristics of the knee region.</description>

      <title>Effects of Viscosity on Sloshing Cold Fronts in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscous properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) remain poorly constrained. Cold fronts-sharp discontinuities formed during cluster mergers-offer a potential avenue to probe the effective viscosity of the ICM. Velocity shear across these fronts should generate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), unless viscosity or magnetic tension suppresses them. We perform cluster merger simulations incorporating four ICM viscosity models: (A) inviscid, (B) isotropic Spitzer viscosity, (C) anisotropic Braginskii viscosity, and (D) Braginskii viscosity limited by microinstabilities. The isotropic Spitzer viscosity (case B) strongly suppresses KHI, producing smooth cold front surfaces, while the inviscid (A) and microinstability-limited (D) cases show prominent ripples. The Braginskii case (C) yields intermediate suppression. We also vary the plasma $\beta$ parameter ($\beta \approx$ 100 and 1600) to examine how a changing magnetic field strength affects the results. Stronger magnetic fields further suppress KHI, leading to smoother fronts and reduced differences between different viscosity models, while also widening the range of permitted pressure anisotropies when microinstability-based limiters are present. These results indicate that both viscosity and magnetic fields play crucial roles in stabilising sloshing cold fronts in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT search for persistent radio sources towards twenty-five localised Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of persistent radio sources (PRSs) associated with repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has shed light on the immediate environments and possible progenitors of these FRBs. The confirmed PRSs may support the theory that FRB progenitors are compact central engines, whilst the non-detections suggest diversity of FRB's local environment. We perform a subarcsecond-resolution MeerKAT search at 1.28 GHz on 25 well-localised FRB positions provided by ASKAP and MeerTRAP. We detect 14 radio sources and provide flux upper limits for 12 non-detections (both these numbers include a source that was detected during two epochs of observation, and not detected during one epoch, adding up to 26). One radio source shows variability as seen in flux variations over three epochs of observation. Archival optical data reveal excesses in the direction of 13 detected radio sources. Similarly for four sources in the X-ray band, with one possibly being a high-energy signature of a radio galaxy core. Since we cannot definitively classify our detected radio sources as PRSs, future high-resolution observations with e-MERLIN will be required to resolve the radio emission and pronounce on the presence of compact PRSs associated with the 14 detected sources presented here.</description>

      <title>Pulsars and Millisecond Pulsars I: Advancements, Open Questions and finding Gaps via statistical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) based on multiwavelength observations in the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters. We examine their emission properties, timing behavior, and spatial distributions, and discuss how theoretical models are required to interpret these observational trends. We focus on the magnetic field spin relation, including spin up through accretion in binaries and spin down driven by magnetic dipole radiation. Using numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we explore how dynamical interactions and binary evolution shape the properties of compact objects. Despite major progress, several open questions remain regarding binary interactions, magnetic field evolution, and the incorporation of pulsar physics into large scale simulations. Our analysis highlights the need for improved modeling frameworks to better understand the formation pathways and long term evolution of pulsars and MSPs.</description>

      <title>Pulsars and Millisecond Pulsars II: Deep diving into the Evolutionary Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This second paper in our series investigates the evolutionary mechanisms that shape pulsars and millisecond pulsars (MSPs) across different astrophysical environments. We focus on the physical processes that govern spin evolution, magnetic field decay, binary interactions, and recycling pathways. Using observational constraints together with theoretical models, we examine how accretion, magnetic braking, and dynamical encounters contribute to the long-term evolution of compact objects. We also explore how these mechanisms differ between the Galactic Field and Globular Clusters, where stellar densities and interaction rates vary significantly. By integrating insights from population studies and numerical tools such as NBODY6++GPU, CMC, and COMPASS, we aim to clarify the dominant channels that lead to the formation and transformation of pulsars and MSPs. Our results highlight key uncertainties in current models and outline the physical ingredients required for more accurate simulations of compact object evolution.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud detected during the first eROSITA all-sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds, the closest star-forming galaxies to the Milky Way, offer an excellent environment to study high-mass X-ray binaries. While the Small Magellanic Cloud has been thoroughly investigated with over 120 systems identified, the Large Magellanic Cloud has lacked a complete survey due to its large angular size. Most prior studies targeted central or high-star-formation regions. The SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys now enable a comprehensive coverage of the LMC, particularly due to its close vicinity to the south ecliptic pole. This work aims to improve our understanding of the HMXB population in the LMC by building a flux-limited catalogue. This allows us to compare sample properties with those of HMXB populations in other nearby galaxies. Using detections during the first eROSITA all-sky survey, we cross-matched X-ray positions with optical and infrared catalogues to identify candidate HMXBs. We assigned flags based on multi-wavelength follow-up observations and archival data, using properties of known LMC HMXBs. These flags defined confidence classes for our candidates. We detect sources down to X-ray luminosities of a few $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, resulting in a catalogue of 53 objects, including 28 confirmed HMXBs and 21 new eROSITA detections. We identify several likely supergiant systems, including a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient with phase-dependent flares. We find three Be stars with likely white dwarf companions. Two of the Be/WD candidates show steady luminosities across four eROSITA scans, unlike the post-nova states seen in the majority of previous Be/WD reports. Our catalogue is the first to cover the entire LMC since the ROSAT era, providing a basis for statistical population studies. Using the HMXB population, we estimate the LMC star-formation rate to be $(0.22^{+0.06}_{-0.07})$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with other tracers.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Emission from Gamma-ray Burst Jet Propagating inside the Cavity within Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) from the merger of binary compact objects (BCOs) could occur in the accretion disks of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Before merging, the BCO will inevitably form a low-density cavity. The sGRB jet will interact with the AGN disk photons during its propagation through the cavity, leading to unique electromagnetic and neutrino signatures. In this work, we investigate the influence of the AGN disk photon field on neutrino emission within the internal dissipation regions of a two-component sGRB jet (a narrow core and a wide wing). We find that, due to the strong AGN disk photon field, the neutrino flux at high-energy part (e.g., PeV to EeV) will be suppressed, while the relatively lower-energy part (e.g., TeV to PeV) will be enhanced. Such a conclusion can enhance the constraints on GRB parameters (e.g., baryonic loading factor and bulk Lorentz factor) based on the future detection or non-detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs. Besides, the two-component jet can display two-bump structure at higher and lower energy in the neutrino spectrum. Therefore, the joint observations of electromagnetic and neutrinos emission can help us identify the sGRB jet and its structure in the AGN disk.</description>

      <title>High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of Cen X-3 with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of two XMM-Newton observations of the high-mass X-ray binary system Cen X-3 is presented. In particular, it is focused on the eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra in order to compare the properties of the environment around the compact object. The high-resolution spectra obtained from the reflection grating spectrometer on board XMM-Newton was analysed focusing on studying eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra separately. Several continuum models were explored in SPEX for which we studied the properties of emitting and absorbing matter depending on the emission and absorption lines identified in the spectra. It was found that the X-ray continuum is heavily absorbed by a neutral gas and photoionised matter. Emission lines from Si v, Mg xii, Mg xi, and Ne x were detected in the eclipse spectrum. In particular, H-like lines of Mg and Ne with a significance greater than 5 sigma in the eclipse spectrum and 3 sigma in the out-of-eclipse spectrum. But in the out-of-eclipse spectrum any absorption lines, if any, were detected with a significance less than 2 sigma. RGS light curve showed dips in the out-of-eclipse spectrum which are not due to an increase in the column absorption but may be produced by instabilities in the accretion stream. On the other hand, the level of counts above 20 was compatible with the X-ray background. A simple local continuum model was used to describe the He-like triplet of Ne and the derived values of R and G ratio parameters pointed out that the UV photospheric field should be important at the line production site and an electron density greater than 10(12) cm-3. As a consequence, a hybrid plasma may be present in the binary system.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Binary Black Hole Mergers with Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Detector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the host galaxy of a binary black hole (BBH) merger detected via gravitational waves (GWs) remains a challenge due to the absence of electromagnetic counterparts and the large localization volumes produced by current-generation detectors. A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z&lt;0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks.</description>

      <title>IceCube's Sensitivity Prospects to MeV-Scale Axion-Like Particles from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential of IceCube to axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), covering ALP masses from 1 MeV to several hundred MeV. A key feature of this work is the explicit handling of the final-state leptons produced in ALP interactions with $^{16}$O nuclei and protons, which can generate Cherenkov light detectable in IceCube. These processes are being fully integrated into a detector-level simulation chain, enabling realistic detector signal modeling beyond existing estimates. The framework enables sensitivity forecasts for both direct detection and constraints based on time delays relative to the neutrino burst, across a range of ALP emission models. This approach may also extend to other MeV-scale dark sector particles. Preliminary sensitivity estimates are in progress and will be presented.</description>

      <title>Is plasmoid-mediated reconnection really important in accretion flows to drive flares in AGNs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on very high-resolution resistive 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of current sheets, our findings suggest that the answer to this question is likely no. In contrast, turbulence-mediated reconnection yields significantly faster reconnection rates - about an order of magnitude higher than the so-called universal rate for plasmoid-mediated reconnection in MHD flows ($V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.01$). We conclude that turbulence-driven reconnection is the dominant mechanism responsible for fast reconnection and flares in systems such as accretion flows and relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In these environments, turbulence is driven by instabilities such as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI), and current-driven kink instability (CDKI). Finally, we present 3D General Relativistic MHD simulations of accretion flows that confirm the crucial role of turbulence-mediated reconnection in AGN systems. These findings have important implications for understanding the origin of flares, particle acceleration, and the production of polarized radiation in these extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Variation of Polar Ice: Implications for Ultrahigh Energy Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper $100 \, \mathrm{m}$ to $150 \, \mathrm{m}$ of the polar ice sheet, called the firn, has a time-dependent density due to seasonal variations in the surface temperature and snow accumulation. We present RF simulations of an in-ice neutrino-induced radio source that show that these density anomalies create variations in the amplitude and propagation times of radio signals propagating through polar firn at an altitude of ${\sim}3000 \, \mathrm{m}$ above sea level. The received power from signals generated in the ice that refract within the upper ${\sim} 15 \, \mathrm{m}$ firn are subject to a seasonal variation on the order of 10\%. These variations result in an irreducible background uncertainty on the reconstructed neutrino energy and arrival direction for detectors using ice as a detection medium.</description>

      <title>On the Deepest Search for Galactic Center Pulsars and an Examination of an Intriguing Millisecond Pulsar Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of one of the most sensitive pulsar surveys to date targeting the innermost region of the Galactic Center (GC) using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at X-band (8--12GHz) using data from the Breakthrough Listen initiative. In total, we collected 9.5 hr of data covering the wider $\sim 8'$ diameter of the GC bulge, and 11 hr on the inner $1.4'$ region between 2021 May and 2023 December. We conducted a comprehensive Fourier-domain periodicity search targeting both canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs), using constant and linearly changing acceleration searches to improve sensitivity to compact binaries. Assuming weak scattering, our searches reached luminosity limits of $L_{\rm min} \approx 0.14~{\rm mJy~kpc^{2}}$ for CPs and $L_{\rm min} \approx 0.26~{\rm mJy~kpc^{2}}$ for MSPs -- sensitive enough to detect the most luminous pulsars expected in the GC. Among 5,282 signal candidates, we identify an interesting 8.19 ms MSP candidate (DM of 2775 pc cm$^{-3}$), persistent in time and frequency across a 1-hr scan at a flux density of $S_{\rm min} \approx 0.007~{\rm mJy}$. We introduce a novel randomization test for evaluating candidate significance against noise fluctuations, including signal persistence via Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and flux-vs-DM behavior. We are unable to make a definitive claim about the candidate due to a mixed degree of confidence from these tests and, more broadly, its non-detection in subsequent observations. This deepens the ongoing missing pulsar problem in the GC, reinforcing the idea that strong scattering and/or extreme orbital dynamics may obscure pulsar signals in this region.</description>

      <title>The Reawakening of 4U 1755-338 after 25 Years of Quiescence: Spectro-temporal Analysis Using Multi-instrument X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary 4U 1755$-$338 underwent an outburst in 2020 after 25 years of quiescence. The comprehensive spectral analysis revealed that the system has a low interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of $0.34\pm0.01 \times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$338.The hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst.</description>

      <title>Microquasar Remnants as Pevatrons Illuminating the Galactic Cosmic Ray Knee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are primary candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, yet their collective contribution to the cosmic ray (CR) ``knee" remains poorly understood. We investigate this contribution by simulating anisotropic diffusive propagation through the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Our results demonstrate that the GMF establishes a transport regime where magnetic connectivity between sources and the solar neighborhood determines the local flux. Active sources aligned with local GMF lines, such as Cygnus X-1, exhibit significant flux enhancements, while magnetically disconnected sources, such as V616 Mon, are strongly suppressed. By integrating source evolution with anisotropic transport, we show that the observed proton bump at the CR ``knee" is best reproduced by the cumulative contribution of microquasar remnants, which is often dominated by a few nearby or recent events, rather than the active ones alone. We find that a harder injection spectrum allows CRs from remnants to reproduce the PeV bump after propagation, as low-energy CRs have sufficient time to accumulate while high-energy CRs escape the Galactic plane. Our findings suggest that the integrated history of microquasar remnants, governed by the interplay of source age and magnetic connectivity, is the primary driver populating the observed CR ``knee''.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of the Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark--Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as Perfect Fluids: Extracting the Linearized Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the general relativistic linear tidal response of a neutron star modeled as a barotropic perfect fluid. From the covariant fluid effective action, we linearize about equilibrium and obtain the action for fluid displacements coupled to metric perturbations. Splitting the latter into external and induced parts and integrating out the induced field yields a Hermitian operator and a discrete gapped spectrum of driven modes. Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.</description>

      <title>Scintillation muon telescope module with fiber-optic light collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scintillation muon telescope module with fiber-optic light collection using silicon photomultipliers was developed, tested, and installed for continuous monitoring to study cosmic ray variations. The aim of this study was to create a scintillation muon telescope module, continuously monitor the muon component in test mode, and study the long-term stability of the detector parameters. Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors. The results of testing and long-term continuous monitoring showed that the stability of the developed muon detector is better than 0.1%/year, without the need for its operation in a thermostatic chamber. The study concludes that ease of operation, cost, compactness, low power consumption and stability are factors that determine the advantages of the developed module, which is an essential element for constructing a multidirectional muon telescope.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently provided compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, offering a unique window into fundamental physics. Here, we explore implications for symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, a theory in which deviations from General Relativity (GR) arise through the non-metricity scalar $f(Q)$. Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision. These results highlight PTAs as powerful probes of non-metricity-based modifications to gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Informed Inference of 21-cm Global Signal Parameters</title>

Abstract: Understanding how and when the first stars and galaxies formed remains one of the central challenges in modern cosmology. These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Black Hole Image Generation via Latent Space Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting horizon-scale black hole images currently relies on computationally intensive General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) simulations, which pose a significant bottleneck for rapid parameter exploration and high-precision tests of strong-field gravity. We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>New solution to the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars: Quantum many-body effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperon puzzle refers to the challenge of reconciling the existence of hyperons in neutron star cores and the observed high masses of neutron stars. The recent discovery of PSR J0952-0607 ($2.35\pm0.17 M_{\odot}$) has intensified this challenge. Existing solutions fail to achieve such a high mass, and often predict unrealistically fast cooling that is at odds with observations. Here, we propose a novel solution to the hyperon puzzle. Using the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, we incorporate the quantum many-body effects caused by strong baryon-meson interactions into the equation of state for cold baryonic matter and find it stiff enough to support a maximum hyperon-star mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2.59 M_{\odot}$, which can explain all the observed high neutron-star masses. The resulting proton and hyperon fractions are remarkably low, thus the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes are significantly suppressed. As a result, fast cooling typically does not occur in ordinary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Boson Cloud Atlas: Direct mass measurements of superradiance clouds near black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars emerge naturally in several motivated particle physics scenarios and are viable candidates for dark matter. While laboratory detection of such bosons is challenging, their existence in nature can be imprinted on measurable properties of astrophysical black holes (BHs). The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH. We find that a precision of $\sim 1\%$ on the two spin measurements is required to exclude the null hypothesis of no dark mass around the BH at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level for dark masses about a few percent of the BH mass, as motivated in some superradiance scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transonic accretion flow in the mini discs of a binary black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general relativistic transonic accretion flow around the primary black hole, which forms the circumprimary disc (CPD), within a binary black hole (BBH) system. The BBH spacetime is characterized by the mass ratio ($q$) and the separation distance ($z_2$) between the two black holes. We numerically solve the radial momentum and energy equations to obtain the accretion solutions. It is observed that the CPD can exhibit shock solutions, which exist for a wide range parameter space spanned by flow specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$). We find that the shock parameter space is modified by $q$ and $z_2$. Investigations show that $q$ and $z_2$ also affect various shock properties, such as density compression and temperature compression across the shock fronts. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the CPD and examine how the SEDs are modified by $q$ and $z_2$ for both shock-free and shock-induced accretion solutions. SED is found to be nearly independent of the binary parameters. We essentially show that although $q$ and $z_2$ alter the effective horizon area of the primary black hole located at the center of the CPD, they have a minimal impact on the dynamical and spectral properties of the accretion flow around the primary black hole.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Shock Model of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that a hierarchical shock model$\unicode{x2014}$including supernova remnant shocks, galactic wind termination shocks, and accretion shocks around cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters$\unicode{x2014}$can naturally explain the cosmic ray spectrum from ~1 GeV up to ~200 EeV. While this framework applies to the entire cosmic ray spectrum, in this work, we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early-Universe galactic outflows, cosmic ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by three orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and potentially contribute to the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Evidence of Spin Energy Extraction from Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets have been found for decades as a key phenomenon in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), compact binary systems, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their energy resources remain a mystery. Two competing ideas prevail: one attributes jet energy to accretion power of the black hole (BH), the other, more interestingly, to magnetic extraction of rotational energy from the BH. A decisive observational distinction between them is still elusive. We propose that BHs remnant from their natal GRB activity can serve as a critical testbed to discriminate between these two scenarios. Via analytical approaches, we demonstrate that extraction of rotational energy to power jets during the GRB phase drives the remnant BH to a universal equilibrium spin, independent of accretion history, initial spin, and mass. This model predicts a stellar-mass BH population with this universal spin, a hallmark of BH spin energy extraction. Testing against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0), we find a statistically robust dominant population where secondary BH spins are narrowly centered at $\sim0.05$. These findings provide strong new evidence for BH spin energy extraction.</description>

      <title>LVK S241125n: Massive Binary Black Hole Merger Produces Gamma Ray Burst in Active Galactic Nucleus Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the gravitational-wave (GW) event S241125n, detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), has been reported to coincide with a candidate detected by Swift-BAT/GUANO and an X-ray candidate found by FXT onboard of Einstein Probe (EP) and confirmed by Swift-XRT. We estimate that the joint false alarm rate (FAR) for the three candidates is 1 / 30 yr and that the corresponding false alarm probability (FAP) is $\mathrm{FAP}_{\rm triple} = 0.037$ ($1.8 \sigma$). The coincidence between the GW and GRB could be an interesting test of their origin and open attractive opportunities for multi-messenger observations, if they are actually associated. Motivated by this, we propose a theoretical model in which a binary black hole (BBH) merger occurs within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. The typically massive and significantly kicked merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates, and the resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. As the jet interacts with the gas in the AGN disk, the shock breakout produces a Comptonized spectrum, consistent with an unusually soft photon index of the GRB prompt emission observed by Swift-BAT following LVK S241125n. Meanwhile, strong absorption and dust extinction of the afterglow by the high column density typical of AGN disks could explain the unusually hard spectrum observed in the X-ray band by EP, as well as the non-detection of an optical counterpart. Our model is predictive, and we highlight the importance of further constraining the orbital eccentricity of the merger and conducting deep-field observations of the host galaxy to test our explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.</description>

      <title>Testing Magnetic Field Configurations in Spider Pulsar PSR J1723-2837 with IXPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetry observations of a redback millisecond pulsar binary, PSR J1723-2837, with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the 3DPol radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD&lt;~50% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin. Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is a priori not known but is strictly periodic.</description>

      <title>Repeating versus Nonrepeating Fast Radio Bursts: A Deep Learning Approach to Morphological Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near future.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength study of the Galactic center black hole candidate MAXI J1744-294</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time in nearly a decade, a bright transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy. MAXI J1744-294, or -- as it was known in its previous life -- Swift J174540.2-290037, was discovered in outburst by the MAXI telescope in January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of MAXI J1744-294, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We analyze the changing X-ray emission as the outburst evolved from the high/soft to the low/hard state. Using relativistic reflection features in the data, we estimate a spin of $a&gt;0.92$ and viewing inclination $\theta=28^{+3}_{-4}$ deg, consistent with the parameters measured for Swift J174540.2-290037. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of MAXI J1744-294, we reaffirm its classification as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) -- the third candidate BH transient discovered within 20 arcsec of the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr~A*. This work provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational studies and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our ongoing multi-wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>Pair luminosity and cooling of newborn strange star: unpaired quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with temperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\pm\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star made of unpaired quarks taking into account its thermal conductivity and neutrino emission by the URCA processes $d\rightarrow u + e + \bar\nu_e$ and $u+e\rightarrow d+\nu_e$. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases, reaching $10^{43}$ erg/s already at $10^2$ seconds. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.</description>

      <title>Eclipsed X-ray Bursts from Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and the Fireball Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theory, burst activity of the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. However, the smoking-gun observational evidence of the fireball is elusive. We envisage that the fireball emission should occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we first discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM and Fermi/GBM. Then, based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$, and the distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than 5 times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. Furthermore, we find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature we found in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.</description>

Abstract: COMCUBE-S (COMCUBE-S (Compton Telescope CubeSat Swarm) is a proposed mission aimed at understanding the radiation mechanisms of ultra-relativistic jets from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) spectrometer to perform timing, spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs. The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to photons in strong magnetic fields, producing characteristic fluctuations in X-ray spectra. Using data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we analyzed three pulsars: PSR J2229+6114, PSR J1849-0001, and PSR B0531+21, to search for such features. Each spectrum was modeled with a sliding-window power-law fitting method to identify local deviations from the smooth continuum. From these analyses, we derived constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ assuming dipole and quadrupole magnetic field distributions. We obtain upper limits in the range $10^{-10}$--$10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses in the $0.8$--$10~\mathrm{keV}$ region.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Inner Accretion Flow in Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across Intermediate States: Insights from Broadband Spectral and Timing Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8--1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. Spectral data up to 78 keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) require models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk in the SIMS moves substantially closer to the innermost stable circular orbit, accompanied by a significant rise in disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component and assuming the distance of 3.4 kpc, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.3^{+5.5}_{-2.5}~M_\odot$, spin of $0.79^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$, and the disk inclination angle of $\sim37\degr$--$53\degr$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray "echo" - a delayed emission from electromagnetic cascades initiated by the highest energy photons from the sources at cosmological distances. While these fields contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray "echo", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 8.6\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</description>

      <title>A case for Case A: detailed look at binary black hole formation through stable mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\odot$ and $2Z_\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z&gt;0.2Z_\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\chi_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Appearance of Self-gravitating AGN Disks Powered by Stellar Objects: Universal Effective Temperature in the Optical Continuum and Application to Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/\alpha \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.</description>

Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>

Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>
