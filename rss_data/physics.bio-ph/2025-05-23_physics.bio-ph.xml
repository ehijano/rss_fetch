      <title>Theory of cell size regulation during migration in adhered cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell migration is closely linked to cell shape, yet cell size is often assumed to remain constant. This assumption is challenged by recent experiments showing that cells undergo volume loss during spreading and swelling upon activation, with migration velocity correlated to cell size. In this Letter, we present a minimal theoretical framework for cellular size regulation and its influence on migration velocity. We connect cell size to membrane potential and active, actin-driven forces. Spatial inhomogeneities in these forces establish cell polarization and drive migration. Crucially, inhomogeneity is easier to establish over larger sizes, giving rise to a critical contact area, above which migration is possible. Our theory captures the coupled dynamics of cell volume, surface area, and motility and explains recent experiments on neutrophils.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.</description>

      <title>Coherent Turning Behaviors Revealed Across Adherent Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adherent cells have long been known to display two modes during migration: a faster mode that is persistent in direction and a slower one where they turn. Compared to the persistent mode, the turns are less studied. Here we develop a simple yet effective protocol to isolate the turns quantitatively. With the protocol, we study different adherent cells in different morphological states and find that, during turns, the cells behave as rotors with constant turning rates but random turning directions. To perform tactic motion, the cells bias the sign of turning towards the stimuli. Our results clarify the bimodal kinematics of adherent cell migration. Compared to the rotational-diffusion-based turning dynamics - which has been widely implemented, our data reveal a distinct picture, where turns are governed by a deterministic angular velocity.</description>

      <title>Effects of curvature on growing films of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To provide insight into the basic properties of emerging structures when bacteria or other microorganisms conquer surfaces, it is crucial to analyze their growth behavior during the formation of thin films. In this regard, many theoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They repel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when reaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of a certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the consequences of the curvature of individuals on the growth of colonies and thin active films. This individual curvature, so far hardly considered, turns out to qualitatively affect the overall growth behavior of the colony. Particularly, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures, while the size of orientationally ordered domains in the colony is significantly decreased. Furthermore, we identify emergent spatio-orientational coupling that is not observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a fundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on surfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.</description>
