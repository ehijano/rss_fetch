      <title>The Shannon capacity of graph powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, its $k$-th graph power $G^k$ is constructed by placing an edge between two vertices if they are within distance $k$. We consider the problem of deriving upper bounds on the Shannon capacity of graph powers by using spectral graph theory and linear optimization methods. First, we use the so-called ratio-type bound to provide an alternative and spectral proof of a result by Lov\'asz [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 1979], which states that, for a regular graph, the Hoffman ratio bound on the independence number is also an upper bound on the Lov\'asz theta number and, hence, also on the Shannon capacity. In fact, we show that Lov\'asz' result holds in the more general context of graph powers. Secondly, we derive another bound on the Shannon capacity of graph powers, the so-called rank-type bound, which depends on a new family of polynomials that can be computed by running a simple algorithm. Lastly, we provide several computational experiments that demonstrate the sharpness of the two proposed algebraic bounds. As a byproduct, when these two new algebraic bounds are tight, they can be used to easily derive the exact values of the Lov\'asz theta number (which relies on solving an SDP) and the Shannon capacity (which is not known to be computable) of the corresponding graph power.</description>

      <title>Cutting 4 by $n$ grids into two congruent pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the March 2025 issue of Pour la Science, Jean-Paul Delahaye described a wonderful solution to the following problem: How many ways can you divide a 3 by 2n rectangle into two connected, congruent pieces? We show that this problem can be solved by the transfer matrix method, and demonstrate this by computing the generating function for the number of ways to divide a 4 by n rectangle into two connected, congruent parts.</description>

      <title>Edge open packing on subclasses of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have a \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as the \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} is to find an edge open packing set of a given graph with maximum size. In [Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi. Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds. Theor. Comput. Sci., 2024.], Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi pose an open question of the edge open packing problem in chordal graphs. In this paper, we partially answer this open question by showing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the maximum edge open packing problem in the subclasses of chordal graphs. First, we show that the \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} can be solved in polynomial time for \emph{proper interval graphs}. Furthermore, we show that in \emph{block graphs} we can solve this problem in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for \emph{split graphs}.</description>

      <title>$q$-rationals and dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the relationships between the notion of $q$-deformed rational numbers, introduced in our previous work with Sophie Morier-Genoud, and the theory of dimer models. We show that $q$-deformed rationals can be calculated in terms of perfect matchings of certain bipartite graphs, known as snake graphs, or ribbon tiles, etc. equipped with a certain weight function on the set of edges. We apply some elements of the dimer theory to get more information about $q$-rationals.</description>

      <title>Derangements in affine classical groups and Cohen-Lenstra heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that Anzanello's work on the proportion of derangements in affine classical groups over finite fields is related to symplectic and orthogonal Cohen-Lenstra type distributions on integer partitions. This leads to a proof of three q-polynomial identities conjectured by Anzanello, which were crucial for her work.</description>

      <title>On the computation of Kronecker coefficients I: column-row polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a way of computing Kronecker coefficients that uses a new family of rational convex polytopes, called column-row polytopes. We give several different formulas for the computation. They are alternating sums of numbers of integer points of either column-row polytopes or faces of column-row polytopes. We also compute the maximal dimension of these polytopes and give new proofs of some known results of more theoretical nature.</description>

      <title>Integer points in dilates of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study how the number of integer points in a polytope grows as we dilate the polytope. We prove new and essentially tight bounds on this quantity by specifically studying dilates of the Hadamard polytope.
  Our motivation for studying this quantity comes from the problem of understanding the maximal number of monomials in a factor of a multivariate polynomial with $s$ monomials. A recent result by Bhargava, Saraf, and Volkovich showed that if $f$ is an $n$-variate polynomial, where each variable has degree $d$, and $f$ has $s$ monomials, then any factor of $f$ has at most $s^{O(d^2 \log n)}$ monomials. The key technical ingredient of their proof was to show that any polytope with $s$ vertices, where each vertex lies in $\{0,..,d\}^n$, can have at most $s^{O(d^2 \log n)}$ integer points. The precise dependence on $d$ of the number of integer points was left open. We show that this bound, particularly the dependence on $d$, is essentially tight by studying dilates of the Hadamard polytope and proving new lower bounds on the number of its integer points.</description>

      <title>Brooks' theorem for signed graphs with $\Delta=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular $r$-coloring of a signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ is a mapping of its vertices to a circle of circumference $r$ such that: I. each pair of vertices with a negative connection is at distance at least $1$, and II. for each pair with a positive connection, the distance of one from the antipodal of the other is at least $1$. A signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ admits a circular $r$-coloring for some values of $r$ if and only if it has no negative loop. The smallest value of such $r$ is the circular chromatic number, denoted $\chi_{c}(G,\sigma)$. The circular chromatic number is a refinement of the balanced chromatic number, which is mostly studied under the equivalent term $0$-free coloring in the literature.
  Extending Brooks' theorem, M\'a\v cajov\'a, Raspaud, and \v{S}koviera showed that if $\Delta(G)$ is an even number, $G$ is connected, and $(G,\sigma)$ is not (switching) isomorphic to $(K_{\Delta+1},-)$ or $C_{-\ell}$ (when $\Delta(G)=2$), then $\chi_c(G,\sigma)\leq \Delta(G)$ and that the upper bound is tight. For the odd values of $\Delta(G)$, assuming a connected signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ is not isomorphic to $(K_{\Delta+1},-)$, determining the best upper bound for $\chi_c(G, \sigma)$ proves to be more of a challenge. In this work, addressing the first step of this question, we show that if $(G, \sigma)$ is a signed graph of maximum degree 3 with no component isomorphic to $(K_4, -)$, then $\chi_{c}(G, \sigma)\leq \frac{10}{3}$. The upper bound is tight even among signed cubic graphs of girth 5. In particular, there is a signature on the Petersen graph for which the upper of $\frac{10}{3}$ is achieved.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bound for hypercube edge slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are needed in order to slice every edge of the $n$-dimensional hypercube with vertex set $\{\pm 1\}^n$? Here, we say that a hyperplane $H\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ slices an edge of the hypercube if it contains exactly one interior point of the edge. The problem of determining the minimum possible size of a collection of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that every edge of the hypercube is sliced by at least one of these hyperplanes, is more than 50 years old and has been studied by many researchers. We prove that, for sufficiently large $n$, at least $\Omega(n^{13/19}\log^{-32/19}n)$ hyperplanes are needed, improving upon the best previous lower bound $\Omega(n^{2/3}\log^{-4/3}n)$ due to Klein.</description>

      <title>Closed Neighborhood Balanced k-Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer k greater than or equal to 2, a coloring of vertices of G using exactly k colors such that every vertex has an equal number of vertices of each color in its closed neighborhood is called closed neighborhood-balanced k-coloring, and the graph which admits such a coloring is called closed neighborhood balanced k-colored graph. We derive some necessary/sufficient conditions for a graph to admit a closed neighborhood balanced k-coloring and discuss various graph operations involving such graphs. Furthermore, we prove that there is no forbidden subgraph characterization for the class of closed neighborhood-balanced k-colorable graphs.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics and Orbit Structure of the Topdrop Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topdrop map, a mapping on permutations in $S_n$ related to card shuffling. We show this map is bijective and study its orbit structure. We introduce the notion of the topdrop-necklace as a way of classifying the orbits of the map and establish a general theorem to count orbits using topdrop-necklaces. We then provide exact counts for orbits of size two through five and lower bounds for the number of orbits of sizes six and eight. We show symmetries in orbits which happen when $n$ or $n-1$ is in the topdrop-necklace, count these orbits, and show that they have even size. We prove a restriction on topdrop-necklaces based on permutation parity.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of interval and proper interval graphs for simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate generalizations of interval and proper interval graphs to simplicial complexes, including strong interval, unit interval, and under closed variants. Through equivalent combinatorial and algebraic characterizations, we uncover hierarchies among these classes and extend key results to higher dimensions, such as the equivalence of closed and proper interval graphs. These formulations enable significant applications, including finding conditions for the sortability of d-independence complexes, constructions of normal Cohen-Macaulay domains linked to d-unit interval graphs, and forbidden subgraph theorems establishing chordality and d-claw-freeness. Our work advances the connections between graph theory, simplicial complexes, and commutative algebra, offering new insights into the algebraic underpinnings of combinatorial structures.</description>

      <title>On the non-zero divisor graph of the Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with unity. The non-zero divisor graph of $R$, $\Phi(R)$, is the graph with vertex set $R\backslash \{0,1,-1\}$, and two vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if either $xy$ or $yx$ is non-zero. In this article we associate $\Phi(R)$ to the ring of Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$, $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$. The detailed structure of the elements in $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$ is presented, based on which various structural properties of the graph $\Phi(\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n}))$, such as connectedness, adjacency of vertices, traversability, and planarity, are studied. Furthermore, we derive bounds for clique number and chromatic number.</description>

Abstract: The theory of graphons has proven to be a powerful tool in many areas of graph theory. In this paper, we introduce several foundational aspects of the theory of digraphons -- asymmetric two-variable functions that arise as limits of sequences of directed graphs (digraphs). Our results address their decomposition into strongly connected components, periodicity, spectral properties, and asymptotic behaviour of their large powers.</description>

      <title>Perfect Overpartitions and Factorization of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his classic text, \emph{Combinatory Analysis}, MacMahon defined a perfect partition of a positive integer $n$ as a partition whose parts contain exactly one partition of every positive integer not exceeding $n$. In this paper we apply the same definition to overpartitions which are integer partitions with the additional property that the final occurrence of each part may be overlined. It turns out that perfect overpartitions are enumerated by ordered factorization functions in which the occurrence of 2 as a factor determines the presence of an overlined part.</description>

      <title>Generic sampling and invariant measures on the space of $k$-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a model-theoretic representation theorem for the distribution of an ergodic exchangeable $k$-uniform hypergraph: every such measure arises as the pushforward of the countably-iterated Morley product of a global Borel-definable Keisler measure over the countable universal homogeneous $k$-uniform hypergraph. We show this by starting with a Borel $k$-hypergraphon $W$ and constructing a Keisler measure $\mu_{W}$ such that generic sampling with respect to $\mu_{W}$ yields the same invariant measure as does the standard hypergraphon sampling procedure with respect to $W$. When $k = 2$, our results give a new representation theorem for ergodic exchangeable graphs via Keisler measures over a monster model of the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Avoiding Peak Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, Hamaker, Pawlowski, and Sagan introduced the \emph{pattern quasisymmetric functions}, which are quasisymmetric functions associated with pattern-avoidance classes of permutations, and defined via expansions in fundamental quasisymmetric functions. They determined which subsets of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_3$ index pattern quasisymmetric functions that are symmetric, and showed that these symmetric pattern quasisymmetric functions are also Schur-positive. They then posed the question of when symmetry or Schur $P$-positivity occur for analogous quasisymmetric functions defined in terms of peak functions. In this work we answer this question, that is, we identify precisely which subsets of $\mathfrak{S}_3$ give a \emph{pattern-avoiding peak function} that is symmetric, and give explicit formulas for the positive expansion into the closely-related Schur $Q$-functions.</description>

      <title>On the Terwilliger algebras of quasi-thin Schurian association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Terwilliger algebra of a quasi-thin Schurian association scheme to coincide with: (a) the centralizer algebra of a point stabilizer of its automorphism group, and (b) its subspace $T^0$. As a by-product, a full characterization of triply-transitive quasi-thin association schemes is given. Using the latter, we provide new infinite families of triply-transitive association schemes.</description>

      <title>On the second largest eigenvalue of certain graphs in the perfect matching association scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perfect matching association scheme is a set of relations on the perfect matchings of the complete graph on $2n$ vertices. The relations between perfect matchings are defined by the cycle structure of the union of any two perfect matchings, and each relation can be represented as a matrix. Each matrix is labeled by an integer partition whose parts correspond to the size do the cycles in the union. Since these matrices form an association scheme, they are simultaneously diagonalizable. Further, it is well-known that the common eigenspaces correspond to the irreducible representations of $S_{2n}$ indexed by the even partitions of $2n$. In this paper, we conjecture that the second largest eigenvalue of the matrices in the perfect matching association scheme labeled by a partition containing at least two parts of size 1 always occurs on the eigenspace corresponding to the representation indexed by $[2n-2, 2]$. We confirm this conjecture for matrices labeled by the partitions $[2, 1^{n-2}], [3, 1^{n-3}], [2, 2, 1^{n-4}], [4, 1^{n-4}], [3, 2, 1^{n-5}]$, and $[5, 1^{n-5}]$, as well as any partition in which the first part is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a consequence of the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem, the nonvanishing of Hodge numbers of line bundles on a Grassmannian can be reinterpreted in terms of the existence of $t$-core partitions inside a rectangle. We sharpen known conditions for the nonvanishing of Hodge numbers of line bundles on a Grassmannian and give an elementary proof of the Nakano vanishing theorem in this setting. Using the theory of $t$-core partitions, we determine when $H^i(\mathrm{Gr}(k,n),\Omega^j(t))$ vanishes in the cases $t=3$ and $i+j\geq k(n-k)-1$.</description>

      <title>Hitting all longest paths in $H$-free graphs and $H$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{longest path transversal number} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $lpt(G)$, is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ that intersects all longest paths in $G$. We present constant upper bounds for the longest path transversal number of \textit{hereditary classes of graphs}, that is, classes of graphs closed under taking induced subgraphs. Our first main result is a structural theorem that allows us to \textit{refine} a given longest path transversal in a graph using domination properties. This has several consequences: First, it implies that for every $t \in \{5,6\}$, every connected $P_t$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-2$. Second, it shows that every $(\textit{bull}, \textit{chair})$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq 5$. Third, it implies that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, every connected chordal graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-1$, where $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ is the graph obtained from a $t$-clique and an independent set of size $t$ by adding a perfect matching between them. Our second main result provides an upper bound for the longest path transversal number in \textit{$H$-intersection graphs}. For a given graph $H$, a graph $G$ is called an \textit{$H$-graph} if there exists a subdivision $H'$ of $H$ such that $G$ is the intersection graph of a family of vertex subsets of $H'$ that each induce connected subgraphs. The concept of $H$-graphs, introduced by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza, naturally captures interval graphs, circular-arc graphs, and chordal graphs, among others. Our result shows that for every connected graph $H$ with at least two vertices, there exists an integer $k = k(H)$ such that every connected $H$-graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq k$.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional symmetric designs of propriety 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define symmetric designs of dimension $n$ and propriety $d$, providing a unifying generalization of several classes of higher-dimensional symmetric designs previously studied. We focus on the case $n=d=3$, which leads to the following question: Can we fill the $v^3$ cells of a $v\times v\times v$ cube with $\{0,1\}$ in such a way that each layer parallel to each face contains a fixed number $k$ of ones, and that for every two parallel layers there are exactly $\lambda$ positions where they have matching ones? We establish necessary conditions on the parameters $(v,k,\lambda)$, introduce notions of difference sets and multipliers for these objects, and enumerate small examples up to equivalence. Furthermore, we construct infinite families of these objects using difference sets, symmetric designs, doubly regular tournaments, Hadamard matrices, Latin cubes, and association schemes on triples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the vertical and horizontal insertion encodings of Cayley permutations to enumerate restricted growth functions, which are in bijection with unordered set partitions. For both insertion encodings, we fully classify the classes for which these languages are regular. For the horizontal insertion encoding, we also prove that the conditions to be regular are the same for restricted growth functions of matchings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be an additively written monoid and let $\mathcal{P}_{0}(H)$ denote the reduced power monoid of $H$, that is, the monoid consisting of all subsets of $H$ containing $0$ with set addition as operation. Following work of Tringali, Wen and Yan, we give a full description of the automorphism group of $\mathcal{P}_{0}(G)$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group. More precisely, we show that $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{P}_{0}(G))$ and $\text{Aut}(G)$ are isomorphic in a canonic way, except in the special case when $G$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.</description>

      <title>Determining Covering Array Numbers via Balanced Covering Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we determine five previously unknown covering array numbers (CANs). We do so using properties of so called balanced covering arrays together with a computational result for these. The balance properties allow us to generalize the (computational) non-existence result for balanced covering arrays to covering arrays. Covering arrays are combinatorial designs that can be considered generalizations of orthogonal arrays, when dropping the restriction that the considered $t$-tuples appear exactly $\lambda$ times, and instead require them to appear at least $\lambda$ times. While this generalization renders the existence of covering arrays trivial, it raises the question for their optimality, respectively the smallest number of rows, the CAN, for which a certain covering array exists. The CANs determined in this paper were tightly bound for decades, but remained ultimately unknown.</description>

      <title>List-recoloring of two classes of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ with a list assignment $L$ and two $L$-colorings $\alpha$ and $\beta$, an $L$-recoloring sequence from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is a sequence of proper $L$-colorings where consecutive colorings differ at exactly one vertex. We prove the existence of such a recoloring sequence in which every vertex is recolored at most a constant number of times under two conditions: (i) $G$ is planar, contains no $3$-cycles or intersecting $4$-cycles, and $L$ is a $6$-assignment; or (ii) the maximum average degree of $G$ satisfies $\mathrm{mad}(G) &lt; \frac{5}{2}$ and $L$ is a $4$-assignment. These results strengthen two theorems previously established by Cranston.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an inhomogeneous variant of random 2-SAT. Each variable $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is assigned a type from a state space $\Lambda$, independently at random. Clause inclusion is governed by a symmetric measurable kernel $W$ on $(\Lambda \times \{+,-\})^2$, in analogy with the inhomogeneous random graph model of Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan: given literals $\ell_i\in\{v_i,\neg v_i\}$ and $\ell_j\in\{v_j,\neg v_j\}$, the clause $\{\ell_i,\ell_j\}$ appears with probability $W(\mathrm{type}(\ell_i),\mathrm{type}(\ell_j))/(2n)$. In particular, for a variable $v_i$ of type $x\in\Lambda$, the slices $W((+,x),\cdot)$ and $W((-,x),\cdot)$ describe how $v_i$ and $\neg v_i$ interact with other literals.
  We identify a parameter $\rho^*(W)$, defined as the spectral radius of an integral operator derived from $W$, and show that $\rho^*(W)&lt;1$ and $\rho^*(W)&gt;1$ correspond to asymptotically almost surely satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances, respectively. The satisfiability threshold of homogeneous random 2-SAT is long known to appear at the ratio $1$ between the number of the clauses and the number of the variables which corresponds to $W \equiv 1$ and clause density $1/(2n)$. Our result extends this classical result to a broad class of models controlled by types of variables.</description>

      <title>Eulerian posets and $Z$-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a finite partially ordered set. In a recent series of works, Proudfoot introduced the notion of $Z$-polynomials associated with $P$-kernels, providing a unified framework for various intersection cohomology Poincar\'e polynomials arising in diverse areas of mathematics. One of the problems posed by Proudfoot was to interpret the $Z$-polynomial in a fundamental setting -- namely, when $P$ is the lattice of faces of a convex polytope (or, more generally, an Eulerian poset). We resolve this problem by proving that the $Z$-polynomial of any Eulerian poset coincides with the toric $h$-polynomial of the poset of all (possibly empty) closed intervals of $P$, ordered by reverse inclusion. Under suitable polyhedral conditions, this result identifies the $Z$-polynomial of a polytope with the Poincar\'e polynomial of the intersection cohomology of an associated auxiliary polytope. We prove some results about the Chow polynomials of the poset of intervals of an Eulerian poset and relate them with the Veronese transforms on polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated result of Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy, and Szemer\'edi states that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $0&lt;c&lt;1$, such that for all sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq(1/2+\varepsilon)n$ contains every $n$-vertex tree with maximum degree at most $cn/\log n$. This is best possible up to the value of $c$. In this paper, we extend this result to trees with higher maximum degrees, and prove that for $\Delta\gg n/\log n$, roughly speaking, $\delta(G)\geq n-n^{1-(1+o(1))\Delta/n}$ is the asymptotically optimal minimum degree condition which guarantees that $G$ contains every $n$-vertex spanning tree with maximum degree at most $\Delta$. We also prove the corresponding statements in the random graph setting.</description>

Abstract: How many points can be placed in an $n\times n$ grid so that every (affine) line contains at most $k$ points? We prove that for $n \ge k \ge 10^{37}$ the maximum number of points is exactly $kn$. Our proof builds on the recent work of Kov\'acs, Nagy, and Szab\'o (who proved an analogous result when $k$ is at least about $\sqrt{n \log n}$), incorporating ideas of Jain and Pham. Using the same approach, we also obtain new bounds for higher-dimensional extensions of this problem.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the additive irreducibility of small perturbations of the set of squares, recently Hajdu and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy studied a multiplicative analogue of the conjecture for shifted $k$-th powers. They conjectured that for each $k\geq 2$, if one changes $o(X^{1/k})$ elements of $M_k'=\{x^k+1: x \in \mathbb{N}\}$ up to $X$, then the resulting set cannot be written as a product set $AB$ nontrivially. In this paper, we confirm a more general version of their conjecture for $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between combinatorial design theory and the creation of new forms of poetry through a specific combinatorial structure called Steiner triple systems. We introduce five original poems constructed using variations of Steiner triple systems on seven and nine words, illustrating how mathematical structures can inform and inspire new poetic forms. The work includes a reflective discussion from dual creative perspectives; one emphasizing structural design and the other, literary expression, highlighting how formal constraints can foster occasional frustrations, but also unexpected artistic freedoms. This study demonstrates the potential of mathematical frameworks as generative tools in literary creativity.</description>

Abstract: Noncrossing partition posets in a Coxeter group $W$ can fail to be lattices when $W$ is not finite. When the lattice property fails for $W$ of affine type, McCammond and Sulway's construction provides a larger lattice that contains the noncrossing partition poset and that furthermore is a combinatorial Garside structure. We construct a lattice, isomorphic to McCammond and Sulway's lattice, using the representation theory of a corresponding connected tame hereditary algebra and give a representation-theoretic proof that it is a combinatorial Garside structure. To construct the lattice, we introduce para-exceptional sequences and para-exceptional subcategories in the module categories of tame hereditary algebras. Para-exceptional sequences are generalizations of exceptional sequences obtained by enlarging the set of allowed entries to include all non-homogeneous bricks. A para-exceptional subcategory is a subcategory obtained by applying a certain closure-like operator to the wide subcategory generated by a para-exceptional sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

      <title>Random convex chains through the lens of analytic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. The lower boundary of the convex hull of $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, together with $n$ independent uniformly distributed random points in $T$, is called a random convex chain and denoted by $T_n$. We study the random variable $f_0(T_n)$, the number of vertices of this chain. Our first result gives an explicit expression for the bivariate generating function of the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$ in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Building on this analytic representation, we apply a careful singularity analysis to derive a variety of limit theorems for $f_0(T_n)$, including a quantitative central limit theorem, a large deviation principle as well as a precise asymptotics for the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$. Conceptually, our results establish a novel bridge between stochastic geometry and methods from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>On the irrationality exponent of real numbers with low complexity expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \bfx)$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\bfx$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \bfx)$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\bfx$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \bfx) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of $q,t$-matrix models and quantum toroidal algebra recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $q,t$-deformed matrix models give rise to representations of the deformed Virasoro algebra and more generally of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. These representations are described in terms of finite difference equations that induce recursion relations for correlation functions. Under suitable assumptions, these recursions admit unique solutions expressible through "superintegrability" formulas, i.e. explicit closed formulas for averages of Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, we discuss examples arising from localization of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, which include $q,t$-deformation of well known classical ensembles: Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi. We explain how relations in the quantum toroidal algebra can be used to give a new and universal proof of the known superintegrability formulas, as well as to derive new formulas for models that have not been previously studied in the literature. Finally, we make some remarks regarding the relation between superintegrability and orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that super Gromov-Witten invariants can be defined and computed by methods of tropical geometry. When the target is a point, the super invariants are descendant invariants on the moduli space of curves, which can be computed tropically. When the target is a convex, toric variety $X$, we describe a procedure to compute the tropical Euler class of the SUSY normal bundle $\overline{N}_{n, \beta}$ on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}(X, \beta)$, assuming it is locally tropicalizable in the sense of [CG], [CGM]. Then, we define the tropical, genus-0, $n$-marked, super Gromov-Witten invariant of $X$, and compute an example. This gives a tropical interpretation of super Gromov-Witten invariants of convex, toric varieties.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the VC-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a fundamental and well-studied measure of the complexity of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a 1-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). In contrast with closely related problems whose dependency on the treewidth is necessarily double-exponential (assuming the ETH), our algorithm has a relatively low dependency on the treewidth.</description>

Abstract: We study two related quantities which generalize the concept of upper Banach density of a set, to two measurable subsets of the plane. The first of them allows us to generalize a classic result on sufficiently large distances realized in a set of positive upper density, to distances between points of two sets satisfying an appropriate density condition. The second one allows us to show that for all sufficiently large scales $t&gt;0$ and for a smooth, closed, centrally symmetric, planar curve $\Gamma$ which bounds a convex and compact region in the plane and is of non-vanishing curvature, the family consisting of portions of translates of $t\Gamma$ has the maximal possible Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral and semigroup theory for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, a setting where classical Markovian and symmetry principles of graph Laplacians break down. This framework reveals new phenomena: the heat flow may lose positivity, stochasticity, or diagonal dominance, yet regain them asymptotically under precise combinatorial conditions. We derive spectral bounds, characterize eventual positivity and contractivity in $\infty$-norm, and identify the rare cases where the flow remains Markovian. Several examples -- culminating in hypergraphs that are dual of oriented graphs as well as directed realizations of the Fano plane - highlight the genuinely higher-order nature of these dynamics.</description>

In particular, for every $n\geq 3$, the space of countable generalised $n$-gons is Borel complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "pyjama stripe" with parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is the set $E(\varepsilon)$ of all complex numbers $z$ such that the distance from $\Re(z)$ to the nearest integer is at most $\varepsilon$. The Pyjama Problem of Iosevich, Kolountzakis, and Matolcsi asks whether, for every choice of $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is possible to cover the entire complex plane with finitely many rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ around the origin. Manners obtained an affirmative answer to this question by studying a $\times 2, \times 3$-type problem over a suitable solenoid. Manners's argument provided no quantitative bounds (in terms of $\varepsilon$) on the number of rotations required, and Green has highlighted the problem of obtaining such quantitative bounds. Our main result is that $\exp\exp\exp(\varepsilon^{-O(1)})$ rotations of $E(\varepsilon)$ suffice to cover the complex plane. Our analysis makes use of the entropic tools developed by Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Michel, and Venkatesh for quantitative $\times 2, \times 3$-type results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every poset with bounded cliquewidth and with sufficiently large dimension contains the standard example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. This applies in particular to posets whose cover graphs have bounded treewidth, as the cliquewidth of a poset is bounded in terms of the treewidth of the cover graph. For the latter posets, we prove a stronger statement: every such poset with sufficiently large dimension contains the Kelly example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. Using this result, we obtain a full characterization of the minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ such that posets with cover graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ have bounded dimension: they are exactly the classes excluding the cover graph of some Kelly example. Finally, we consider a variant of poset dimension called Boolean dimension, and we prove that posets with bounded cliquewidth have bounded Boolean dimension.
  The proofs rely on Colcombet's deterministic version of Simon's factorization theorem, which is a fundamental tool in formal language and automata theory, and which we believe deserves a wider recognition in structural and algorithmic graph theory.</description>

      <title>Graph Burning: Bounds and Hardness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph. The graph burning is defined as follows: at time $t=0$, all vertices in $G$ are unburned. For each time $t\geq 1$, an unburned vertex is chosen to burn, and at each subsequent time, the fire spreads from each burned vertex to all its neighbors. Once a vertex is burned, it remains burned for all future steps. The process continues until all vertices in $V$ are burned. The burning number of a graph $G$, denoted $b(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_k)\subseteq V$, where $v_i$ is burned at time $i$, and all vertices in $V$ are burned within time step $k$. The Burning Number problem asks whether the burning number of an input graph $G$ is at most $k$ or not. In this paper, we study the Burning Number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The Burning Number problem is known to be NP-complete for interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-complete even when restricted to connected proper interval graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of a graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\lceil \sqrt{n}~\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, the upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the algorithmic complexity of these variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex triangle-free graph. The celebrated Mantel's theorem showed that $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$. In 1962, Erd\H{o}s (together with Gallai), and independently Andr\'{a}sfai, proved that if $G$ is non-bipartite then $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{(n-1)^2}{4}\rfloor+1$. In this paper, we extend this result and show that if $G$ has chromatic number at least four and $n\geq 90$, then $e(G)\leq \lfloor\frac{(n-3)^2}{4}\rfloor+5$. The blow-ups of Gr\"{o}tzsch graph shows that this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Chow and augmented Chow polynomials as evaluations of Poincar\'e-extended ab-indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Chow polynomials and augmented Chow polynomials of matroids, and more generally of finite graded posets admitting R-labelings, are obtained as evaluations of their Poincar\'e-extended ab-indices. This implies in particular explicit combinatorial $\gamma$-positive expansions for both, providing the first proof of the $\gamma$-positivity not relying on the K\"ahler package for the Chow ring. We then evaluate this expansion to obtain an explicit closed formula for the braid arrangement.</description>

Abstract: Cuntz and K\"uhne introduced the class of connected subgraph arrangements $A_G$, depending on a graph $G$, and classified all graphs $G$ such that the corresponding arrangement $A_G$ is free. We extend their result to the multiarrangement case and classify all graphs $G$ for which the corresponding arrangement $A_G$ supports some multiplicity $\mu$ such that the multiarrangement $(A_G,\mu)$ is free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <title>Balanced sets and homotopy invariants of covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a construction of homotopy invariants of open or closed covers, where the homotopy class is defined relative to a pair $(V,r)$, with $V$ a finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $r$ a point in the interior of their convex hull. We show that the simplicial complex of non-balanced subsets associated with $(V,r)$ has the homotopy type of a sphere, and use this to develop a theory of homotopy invariants of covers relative to balanced sets. A key result is that the homotopy class of a cover depends only, up to an involution, on the balanced-equivalence class of $(V,r)$. As applications, we obtain extension theorems for covers in this setting and derive the KKMS lemma, its analogues, and related combinatorial fixed-point results.</description>

Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of probability measures on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev\'{e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <title>On edge-direction and compact edge-end spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directions of graphs were originally introduced in the study of a cops-and-robbers kind of game, while the study of end spaces has been used to generalize classical graph-theoretical results to infinite graphs, such as Halin's generalization of Menger's theorem. An edge-analogue of end spaces, where finite sets of edges are used instead of vertices as separator agents to form the so-called edge-end space, has been recently used to obtain an edge-analogue of this later result. Inspired by Diestel's correspondence between directions and ends of a graph, we tackle in this paper an edge-analogue of directions, its relation with line graphs, and an edge-analogue of Diestel's correspondence. The results of this study had some implications over edge-end space compactness, which then became a target of inquiry: we thus show an edge-analogue of Diestel's combinatorial characterization for compact end spaces. Non-edge-dominating vertices play an important role in our characterization, which motivated the study of ends and directions using now finite sets of these vertices as separator agents, as done previously for edges, giving rise to other topological spaces associated with graphs. These new direction and end spaces once again motivate an analogue of Diestel's correspondence result, and further generalizations are obtained. All of these constructions define topological space-classes associated with graphs such as edge-end spaces and edge-direction spaces of graphs. The paper organizes these topological space-classes appearing throughout the text with representation results, as it was done by Pitz and Kurkofka, as well as Aurichi, Real and Magalh\~aes J\'unior. Most notably, we show that every compact edge-end space can be represented as the edge-direction space of a connected graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the simplicial complex $\Delta _{\mathcal{C}_n,2}$ is pure and a weak pseudomanifold of dimension $2(n-1)$, where $\Delta _{\mathcal{C}_n,2}$ is the simplicial complex associated with $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder with $n$ marked points. This result generalizes the work of Vincent Pilaud and Francisco Santos for polygons and resolves a conjecture of Mathias Lepoutre and Vincent Pilaud for $k=2$. To achieve this, we show that $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder decompose as complexes of star polygons, and that $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder are in bijection with $2$-triangulations on the $4n$-gon invariant under rotation by $\pi/2$ radians. Building on work by Vincent Pilaud and Christian Stump, we also introduce chevron pipe dreams, a new combinatorial model that more naturally captures the symmetries of $k$-triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance eigenvalues of a connected graph $G$ are the eigenvalues of its distance matrix $D(G)$. A graph is called distance integral if all of its distance eigenvalues are integers. Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. The crown graph $Cr(n)$ is a graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ by removing a perfect matching. Let $L(Cr(n))$ denote the line graph of the crown graph $Cr(n)$. Using the equitable partition method, the set of distinct distance eigenvalues of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has been determined which shows that this graph is distance integral [S.Morteza Mirafzal, The line graph of the crown graph is distance integral, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 71, no. 4 (2023): 662-672]. The distance spectrum of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has not been found yet. In this paper, having the set of distance eigenvalues of $L(Cr(n))$ in the hand, we determine the distance spectrum of this graph.</description>

Abstract: A graph is $k$-gap-planar if it has a drawing in the plane such that every crossing can be charged to one of the two edges involved so that at most $k$ crossings are charged to each edge. We show this class of graphs has linear expansion. In particular, every $r$-shallow minor of a $k$-gap-planar graph has density $O(rk)$. Several extensions of this result are proved: for topological minors, for $k$-cover-planar graphs, for $k$-gap-cover-planar graphs, and for drawings on any surface. Application to graph colouring are presented.</description>

      <title>The distance spectrum of the bipartite double cover of strongly regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strongly regular graph with parameters $(n,d,a,c)$ is a $d$-regular graph of order $n$, in which every pair of adjacent vertices has exactly $a$ common neighbor(s) and every pair of nonadjacent vertices has exactly $c$ common neighbor(s). Let $n$ be the number of vertices of the graph $G=(V,E)$. The distance matrix $D=D(G)$ of $G$ is an $n \times n $ matrix with the rows and columns indexed by $V$
  such that $D_{uv} = d_{G}(u, v)=d(u,v)$, where $d_{G}(u, v)$ is the distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$ in the graph $G$. In this paper, we are interested in determining the distance spectrum of the bipartite double cover of the family of strongly regular graphs. In other words, let $G=(V,E)$ be a strongly regular graph with parameters $(n,k,a,c)$. We show that there is a close relationship between the spectrum of $G$ and the distance spectrum of $B(G)$, where $B(G)$ is the double cover of $G$. We explicitly determine the distance spectrum of the graph $B(G)$, according to the spectrum of $G$. In fact, according to the parameters of the graph $G$.</description>

Abstract: A finite set $X$ in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called Ramsey if for every $k$ there exists an integer $n$ such that whenever $\mathbb{R}^n$ is coloured with $k$ colours, there is a monochromatic copy of $X$. Graham conjectured that all spherical sets are Ramsey, but progress on this conjecture has been slow. A key result of K\v{r}\'{i}\v{z} is that all sets that embed in sets that are acted on transitively by a soluble group are Ramsey. We show that for nearly all known examples of Ramsey sets the converse is true, with only two possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>Constructing embedded surfaces for cellular embeddings of leveled spatial graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given spatial graph $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, we would like to find a closed orientable surface $\mathcal{S}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in which $\mathcal{G}$ is cellular embedded. However, for general $\mathcal{G}$ this is not possible. We therefore define a property of spatial graphs, called leveled, to show that for leveled spatial graphs with a small number of levels, a surface $\mathcal{S}$ can always be found. The argument is based on decomposing $\mathcal{G}$ into spatial subgraphs that can be placed on a sphere and on cylinders attached as handles, in such a way that the resulting surface contains a cellular embedding of $\mathcal{G}$. We generalize the procedure to an algorithm that, if successful, constructs $\mathcal{S}$ for leveled spatial graphs with any number of levels. We conjecture that all connected leveled embeddings can be cellular embedded with the presented algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we establish a polynomial identity in three variables $a, b, c$, and with the degree of the polynomial given in terms of two integers $L, M$. By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$. The method couples the graph exploration process to an inhomogeneous Poisson random walk, which yields an exact sampler that runs in $O(n)$ time in the sparse regime $p=c/n$. We also show how the method extends to the $G(n,M)$ model via an additional acceptance-rejection step.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Toda lattice and equivariant $K$-homology of affine Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $k$-hash distances and rates of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k\leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the case of particular interest $q=k=3$ we recover, with a simpler proof, state of the art results in the case $d_3=1$ and new bounds for $d_3&gt;1$. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Finite Groups With Equal Left and Right Quotient Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all finite groups $G$ which have the following property: for all subsets $A \subseteq G$, we have $|AA^{-1}| = |A^{-1}A|$. This question is motivated by the problem in additive combinatorics of More Sums Than Difference sets and answers several questions posed in arXiv:2509.00611 [math.NT].</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</description>
