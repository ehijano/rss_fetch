      <title>Functionally Generated Portfolios Under Stochastic Transaction Costs: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming frictionless trading, classical stochastic portfolio theory (SPT) provides relative arbitrage strategies. However, the costs associated with real-world execution are state-dependent, volatile, and under increasing stress during liquidity shocks. Using an Ito diffusion that may be connected with asset prices, we extend SPT to a continuous-time equity market with proportional, stochastic transaction costs. We derive closed-form lower bounds on cost-adjusted relative wealth for a large class of functionally generated portfolios; these bounds provide sufficient conditions for relative arbitrage to survive random costs. A limit-order-book cost proxy in conjunction with a Milstein scheme validates the theoretical order-of-magnitude estimates. Finally, we use intraday bid-ask spreads as a stand-in for cost volatility in a back-test of CRSP small-cap data (1994--2024). Despite experiencing larger declines during the 2008 and 2020 liquidity crises, diversity- and entropy-weighted portfolios continue to beat the value-weighted benchmark by 3.6 and 2.9 percentage points annually, respectively, after cost deduction.</description>

      <title>Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathcal P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathcal Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&amp;P 500.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Crowding-Out Effect of Investment Herding on Consumption: An Optimal Control Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investment herding, a phenomenon where households mimic the decisions of others rather than relying on their own analysis, has significant effects on financial markets and household behavior. Excessive investment herding may reduce investments and lead to a depletion of household consumption, which is called the crowding-out effect. While existing research has qualitatively examined the impact of investment herding on consumption, quantitative studies in this area remain limited. In this work, we investigate the optimal investment and consumption decisions of households under the impact of investment herding. We formulate an optimization problem to model how investment herding influences household decisions over time. Based on the optimal control theory, we solve for the analytical solutions of optimal investment and consumption decisions. We theoretically analyze the impact of investment herding on household consumption decisions and demonstrate the existence of the crowding-out effect. We further explore how parameters, such as interest rate, excess return rate, and volatility, influence the crowding-out effect. Finally, we conduct a real data test to validate our theoretical analysis of the crowding-out effect. This study is crucial to understanding the impact of investment herding on household consumption and offering valuable insights for policymakers seeking to stimulate consumption and mitigate the negative effects of investment herding on economic growth.</description>
