      <title>On invariant line fields of rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adopting the approach of [7] we study rational function carrying invariant line fields on the Julia set. In particular, we show that under certain weak conditions all possible measurable invariant line fields of a rational function on its Julia set are determined, in a precise sense, by a finite list of canonically defined holomorphic line fields.</description>

      <title>Mixed ergodic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an ergodic optimization problem inspired by information theory, which can be presented informally as follows: given topological dynamical systems $(X, T), (Y, \nu)$, and a continuous function $f \in C(X \times Y)$, what can be said about the extrema $$\sup_{y \in Y} \inf_{x \in X} \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 0}^{k - 1} f \left( T^j x , S^j y \right) ? $$ Our goal in this article is to formalize this problem, present some preliminary results on the topic, and note some remaining open questions in the general theory.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing and sparse equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem asserts that, for an ergodic map, orbits of almost every point equidistributes when sampled at integer times. This result was generalized by Bourgain to many natural sparse subsets of the integers. On the other hand, the behaviour of orbits of \textbf{all} points in a dynamical system is much less understood, especially for sparse subsets of the integers. We generalize a method introduced by A. Venkatesh to tackle this problem in two directions, general $\mathbb{R}^d$ actions instead of flows, and weak mixing, rather than mixing, actions. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of weak mixing and show weak mixing for the time 1-map of a weak mixing flow. The main examples are equidistribution along $\{(n^{1+\epsilon_i})_{i=1}^d\}$, which is a direct generalisation of Venkatesh's example, and equidistribution along random subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for horosperical action.</description>

      <title>Unicritical polynomials over $abc$-fields: from uniform boundedness to dynamical Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field or a number field over which the $abc$ conjecture holds, and let $\phi(x)=x^d+c \in K[x]$ be a unicritical polynomial of degree $d\geq2$ not divisible by the characteristic of $K$. We completely classify all portraits of $K$-rational preperiodic points for such $\phi$ for all sufficiently large degrees $d$. More precisely, we prove that, up to accounting for the natural action of $d$th roots of unity on the preperiodic points for $\phi$, there are exactly thirteen such portraits up to isomorphism. In particular, for all such global fields $K$, it follows from our results together with earlier work of Doyle-Poonen and Looper that the number of $K$-rational preperiodic points for $\phi$ is uniformly bounded, independent of $d$. That is, there is a constant $B(K)$ depending only on $K$ such that $$\big|\text{PrePer}(x^d+c,K)\big|\leq B(K)$$ for all $d\geq2$ and all $c\in K$. Moreover, we apply this work to construct many irreducible polynomials with large dynamical Galois groups in semigroups generated by sets of unicritical polynomials under composition.</description>

      <title>On a quadratic Poisson algebra and integrable Lotka-Volterra systems, with solutions in terms of Lambert's W function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of integrable nonhomogeneous Lotka-Volterra systems whose quadratic terms defined by an antisymmetric matrix and whose linear terms consist of three blocks. We provide the Poisson algebra of their Darboux polynomials, and prove a contraction theorem. We then use these results to classify the systems according to the number of functionally independent (and, for some, commuting) integrals. We also establish separability/solvability by quadratures, given the solutions to the 2- and 3-dimensional systems, which we provide in terms of the Lambert W function.</description>

      <title>Torus and hyperchaos in 3D Lotka-Volterra map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the occurrence of a three-frequency quasiperiodic torus in a three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra map. Our analysis extends to the observation of a doubling bifurcation of a closed invariant curve, leading to a subsequent transition into a state of hyperchaos. The absorption of various saddle periodic orbits into the hyperchaotic attractor is demonstrated through distance computation, and we explore the dimensionality of both stable and unstable manifolds. Various routes to cyclic and disjoint quasiperiodic structures are presented. Specifically we showcase the transition from a saddle-node connection to a saddle-focus connection, leading to the formation of quasiperiodic closed cyclic disjoint curves, as revealed by the computation of one-dimensional unstable manifold. Additionally, we show an unusual transition from a period-two orbit to a period-six orbit and uncover the mechanism related to two subsequent bifurcations: a) subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, and (b) saddle-node bifurcation. Our approach involves the use of computational methods for constructing one-dimensional manifolds, extending saddle periodic orbits through a one-parameter continuation, and employing a multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson approach for pinpointing the saddle periodic orbits in the three-dimensional map.</description>

      <title>A note about dual representations of group actions on Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}(M)$ be the Lipschitz-free space of a pointed metric space $M$. For every isometric continuous group action of $G$ we have an induced continuous dual action on the weak-star compact unit ball $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$ of the dual space $\mathrm{Lip_0} (M)=\mathcal{F}(M)^*$. We pose the question when a given abstract continuous action of $G$ on a topological space $X$ can be represented through a $G$-subspace of $B_{\mathcal{F}(M)^*}$. One of such natural examples is the so-called metric compactification (of isometric $G$-spaces) for a pointed metric space. As well as the Gromov $G$-compactification of a bounded metric $G$-space. Note that there are sufficiently many representations of compact $G$-spaces on Lipschitz-free spaces.</description>

      <title>From Combinatorics to Geometry: The Dynamics of Graph Gradient Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a link between graph theory and geometry that arises when considering graph dynamical systems with odd interactions. The equilibrium set in such systems is not a collection of isolated points, but rather a union of manifolds, which may intersect creating singularities and may vary in dimension. We prove that geometry and stability of such manifolds are governed by combinatorial properties of the underlying graph. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the equilibrium set using graph homology and a lower bound using graph coverings. Moreover, we show how graph automorphisms relate to geometric singularities and prove that the decomposition of a graph into $2$-vertex-connected components induces a decomposition of the equilibrium set that preserves three notions of stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Physics-Informed Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel learning framework for Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems that is informed by the governing equation and guarantees long-time stability and robustness to noise. In contrast to existing frameworks where either ad-hoc observables or blackbox neural networks are used to construct observables in the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our observables are informed by governing equations via Polyflow. To improve the noise robustness and guarantee long-term stability, we designed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator together with a progressive learning strategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in the phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

      <title>Uniform Borel amenability is equivalent to randomized hyperfiniteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measure).</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with the F\o lner property is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

Abstract: We consider a three dimensional complex polynomial, or rational, vector field (equivalently, a two-form in three variables) which admits a Liouvillian first integral. We prove that there exists a first integral whose differential is the product of a rational 1-form with a Darboux function, or there exists a Darboux Jacobi multiplier. Moreover, we prove that Liouvillian integrability {in any dimension $n\geq 3$} always implies the existence of a first integral that is obtained by two successive integrations from one-forms with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves on the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum computers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.</description>
