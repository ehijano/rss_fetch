      <title>Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.</description>

      <title>Omega-Regular Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, a system is said to be robust if it can resist disturbances and still function correctly. For instance, if the requirement is that the temperature remains in an allowed range $[l,h]$, then a system that remains in a range $[l',h']\subset[l,h]$ is more robust than one that reaches $l$ and $h$ from time to time. In this example the initial specification is quantitative in nature, this is not the case in $\omega$-regular properties. Still, it seems there is a natural robustness preference relation induced by an $\omega$-regular property. E.g. for a property requiring that every request is eventually granted, one would say that a system where requests are granted two ticks after they are issued is more robust than one in which requests are answered ninety ticks after they are issued. In this work we manage to distill a robustness preference relation that is induced by a given $\omega$-regular language. The relation is a semantic notion (agnostic to the given representation of $L$) that satisfies some natural criteria.</description>

      <title>Fractals from Regular Behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We forge connections between the theory of fractal sets obtained as attractors of iterated function systems and process calculi. To this end, we reinterpret Milner's expressions for processes as contraction operators on a complete metric space. When the space is, for example, the plane, the denotations of fixed point terms correspond to familiar fractal sets. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of fractal equivalence, the congruence on terms consisting of pairs that construct identical self-similar sets in all interpretations. We further make connections to labelled Markov chains and to invariant measures. In all of this work, we use important results from process calculi. For example, we use Rabinovich's completeness theorem for trace equivalence in our own completeness theorem. In addition to our results, we also raise many questions related to both fractals and process calculi.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>
