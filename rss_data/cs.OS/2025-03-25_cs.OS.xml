      <title>Enabling the Write-Back Page Cache with Strong Consistency in Distributed Userspace File Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale, multi-tenant nature of cloud computing requires distributed file systems that offer stability, adaptability, and compatibility. FUSE-based distributed file systems have emerged as a popular solution for the cloud, offering fast deployment, fault isolation, and POSIX compliance. However, FUSE's performance limitations, particularly its inability to reconcile page caching with strong consistency in distributed environments, remain a persistent problem. Existing approaches either sacrifice consistency for performance or rely on inefficient caching, limiting their practicality.
  To this end, we present DistFUSE, the first FUSE-based distributed file system that relies on a write-back kernel-based page cache for performance and provides strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace lock management to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide consistency without compromising performance. Our evaluation shows DistFUSE improves throughput by up to 75% compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>LEMIX: Enabling Testing of Embedded Applications as Linux Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic analysis, through rehosting, is an important capability for security assessment in embedded systems software. Existing rehosting techniques aim to provide high-fidelity execution by accurately emulating hardware and peripheral interactions. However, these techniques face challenges in adoption due to the increasing number of available peripherals and the complexities involved in designing emulation models for diverse hardware. Additionally, contrary to the prevailing belief that guides existing works, our analysis of reported bugs shows that high-fidelity execution is not required to expose most bugs in embedded software. Our key hypothesis is that security vulnerabilities are more likely to arise at higher abstraction levels. To substantiate our hypothesis, we introduce LEMIX, a framework enabling dynamic analysis of embedded applications by rehosting them as x86 Linux applications decoupled from hardware dependencies. Enabling embedded applications to run natively on Linux facilitates security analysis using available techniques and takes advantage of the powerful hardware available on the Linux platform for higher testing throughput. We develop various techniques to address the challenges involved in converting embedded applications to Linux applications. We evaluated LEMIX on 18 real-world embedded applications across four RTOSes and found 21 new bugs in 12 of the applications and all 4 of the RTOS kernels. We report that LEMIX is superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of code coverage (~2x more coverage) and bug detection (18 more bugs).</description>
