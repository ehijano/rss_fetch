      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: Testing the Lyot coronograph prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MICADO, the European Extremely Large Telescope first light imager will feature a dedicated high contrast imaging mode specifically designed for observing and characterizing exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Its improved sensitivity and angular resolution, compared to existing instruments will significantly increase our knowledge on these planetary systems. MICADO will include three classical Lyot coronagraphs, one vector phase-apodized pupil plane (vAPP) and two sparse apertures. After rapidly describing the final design of MICADO high contrast mode, we will describe the current state of development of the coronographic components and the testing of the first Lyot coronagraph prototypes.</description>

      <title>Polarization effects on high contrast imaging: measurements on THD2 Bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of mature giant planets and low mass planets (Neptune-like, Earth-like) requires instruments capable of achieving very high contrasts ($10^{-10}-10^{-11}$) at short angular separations. To achieve such high performance on a real instrument, many limitations must be overcome: complex component defects (coronagraph, deformable mirror), optical aberrations and scattering, mechanical vibrations and drifts, polarization effects, etc.
  To study the overall impact on a complete system representative of high contrast instruments, we have developed a test bench at Paris Observatory, called THD2. In this paper, we focus on the polarization effects that are present on the bench which creates differential aberrations between the two linear polarization states. We compare the recorded beam positions of the two polarization states with the predicted from the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, both of which cause spatial shifts and angular deviations of the beam, longitudinal and transverse respectively. Although these effects have already been studied in the literature from the optical and quantum mechanical points of view, their measurement and impact on a complete optical bench are rather rare, although they are crucial for high-contrast instruments.
  After describing the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects and estimating their amplitude on the THD2 bench, we present the protocol we used to measure these effects of polarization on the light beam. We compare predictions and measurements and we conclude on the most limiting elements on our bench polarization-wise.</description>

      <title>UPdec-Webb: A Dataset for Coaddition of JWST NIRCam Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the application of the image coaddition algorithm, Up-sampling and PSF Deconvolution Coaddition (UPDC), for stacking multiple exposure images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). By addressing the point spread function (PSF) effect, UPDC provides visually enhanced and sharper images. Furthermore, the anti-aliasing and super-resolution capabilities of UPDC make it easier to deblend sources overlapped on images, yielding a higher accuracy of aperture photometry. We apply this algorithm to the SMACS J0723 imaging data. Comparative analysis with the Drizzle algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in detecting faint sources, achieving accurate photometry, and effectively deblending (super-resolution) closely packed sources. {As a result, we have newly detected a pair of close binary stars that were previously unresolvable in the original exposures or the Drizzled image.} These improvements significantly benefit various scientific projects conducted by JWST. The resulting dataset, named "UPdec-Webb", can be accessible through the official website of the Chinese Virtual Observatory (ChinaVO).</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for radio-astronomy source classification: a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope marks a significant step forward in radio astronomy, presenting new opportunities and challenges for data analysis. Traditional visual models pretrained on optical photography images may not perform optimally on radio interferometry images, which have distinct visual characteristics.
  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to address this issue, leveraging the abundant unlabeled data in radio astronomy to train neural networks that learn useful representations from radio images. This study explores the application of SSL to radio astronomy, comparing the performance of SSL-trained models with that of traditional models pretrained on natural images, evaluating the importance of data curation for SSL, and assessing the potential benefits of self-supervision to different domain-specific radio astronomy datasets.
  Our results indicate that, SSL-trained models achieve significant improvements over the baseline in several downstream tasks, especially in the linear evaluation setting; when the entire backbone is fine-tuned, the benefits of SSL are less evident but still outperform pretraining. These findings suggest that SSL can play a valuable role in efficiently enhancing the analysis of radio astronomical data.

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Vision Transformer for Cosmology Parameter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter inference is a crucial task in modern cosmology that requires accurate and fast computational methods to handle the high precision and volume of observational datasets. In this study, we explore a hybrid vision transformer, the Convolution vision Transformer (CvT), which combines the benefits of vision transformers and convolutional neural networks. We use this approach to infer the $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ cosmological parameters from simulated dark matter and halo fields. Our experiments indicate that the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ obtained using CvT are better than the traditional vision transformer (ViT) and CNN, using either dark matter or halo fields. For CvT, pretraining on dark matter fields proves advantageous for improving constraints using halo fields compared to training a model from the beginning. However, ViT and CNN do not show these benefits. The CvT is more efficient than ViT since, despite having more parameters, it requires a training time similar to that of ViT and has similar inference times. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Yash-10/cvt-cosmo-inference/}.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference with Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02413v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a novel Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method based on conditional quantile regression. NQE autoregressively learns individual one dimensional quantiles for each posterior dimension, conditioned on the data and previous posterior dimensions. Posterior samples are obtained by interpolating the predicted quantiles using monotonic cubic Hermite spline, with specific treatment for the tail behavior and multi-modal distributions. We introduce an alternative definition for the Bayesian credible region using the local Cumulative Density Function (CDF), offering substantially faster evaluation than the traditional Highest Posterior Density Region (HPDR). In case of limited simulation budget and/or known model misspecification, a post-processing calibration step can be integrated into NQE to ensure the unbiasedness of the posterior estimation with negligible additional computational cost. We demonstrate that NQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Spectroscopy for Planetary Sciences: A Characterization of Planetary Materials in the Mid-IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding of the formation and evolution of the Solar System requires understanding key and common materials found on and in planetary bodies. Mineral mixing and its implications on planetary body formation is a topic of high interest to the planetary science community. Previous work establishes a case for the use of Optical PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) in planetary science and introduces and demonstrates the technique's capability to study planetary materials. In this paper, we performed a measurement campaign on granular materials relevant to planetary science, such as minerals found in lunar and martian soils. These laboratory measurements serve to start a database of O-PTIR measurements. We also present FTIR absorption measurements of the materials we observed in O-PTIR for comparison purposes. We find that the O-PTIR technique suffers from granular orientation effects similar to other IR techniques, but in most cases, is is directly comparable to commonly used absorption spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that O-PTIR would be an excellent tool for the purpose of planetary material identification during in-situ investigations on regolith and bedrock surfaces.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>

Abstract: This document compiles results obtained from the test campaign of the European Moon Rover System (EMRS) project. The test campaign, conducted at the Planetary Exploration Lab of DLR in Wessling, aimed to understand the scope of the EMRS breadboard design, its strengths, and the benefits of the modular design. The discussion of test results is based on rover traversal analyses, robustness assessments, wheel deflection analyses, and the overall transportation cost of the rover. This not only enables the comparison of locomotion modes on lunar regolith but also facilitates critical decision-making in the design of future lunar missions.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven approaches play a crucial role in space computing, and our paper focuses on analyzing data to learn more about celestial objects. Photometric redshift, a measure of the shift of light towards the red part of the spectrum, helps determine the distance of celestial objects. This study used a dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with five magnitudes alongside their corresponding redshift labels. Traditionally, redshift prediction relied on spectral distribution templates (SEDs), which, though effective, are costly and limited, especially for large datasets. This paper explores data-driven methodologies instead of SEDs. By employing a decision tree regressor and a fully connected neural network (FCN), we found that the FCN outperforms the decision tree regressor in RMS. The results show that data-driven estimation is a valuable tool for astronomical surveys. With the adaptability to complement previous methods, FCNs will reshape the field of redshift estimation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spectra neural Network (GaSNet). II. Using Deep Learning for Spectral Classification and Redshift Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04146</link>

Abstract: Large sky spectroscopic surveys have reached the scale of photometric surveys in terms of sample sizes and data complexity. These huge datasets require efficient, accurate, and flexible automated tools for data analysis and science exploitation. We present the Galaxy Spectra Network/GaSNet-II, a supervised multi-network deep learning tool for spectra classification and redshift prediction. GaSNet-II can be trained to identify a customized number of classes and optimize the redshift predictions for classified objects in each of them. It also provides redshift errors, using a network-of-networks that reproduces a Monte Carlo test on each spectrum, by randomizing their weight initialization. As a demonstration of the capability of the deep learning pipeline, we use 260k Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra from Data Release 16, separated into 13 classes including 140k galactic, and 120k extragalactic objects. GaSNet-II achieves 92.4% average classification accuracy over the 13 classes (larger than 90% for the majority of them), and an average redshift error of approximately 0.23% for galaxies and 2.1% for quasars. We further train/test the same pipeline to classify spectra and predict redshifts for a sample of 200k 4MOST mock spectra and 21k publicly released DESI spectra. On 4MOST mock data, we reach 93.4% accuracy in 10-class classification and an average redshift error of 0.55% for galaxies and 0.3% for active galactic nuclei. On DESI data, we reach 96% accuracy in (star/galaxy/quasar only) classification and an average redshift error of 2.8% for galaxies and 4.8% for quasars, despite the small sample size available. GaSNet-II can process ~40k spectra in less than one minute, on a normal Desktop GPU. This makes the pipeline particularly suitable for real-time analyses of Stage-IV survey observations and an ideal tool for feedback loops aimed at night-by-night survey strategy optimization.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>TOPO: Time-Ordered Provable Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TOPO (Time-Ordered Provable Outputs), a tool designed to enhance reproducibility and data integrity in astrophysical research, providing a trustless alternative to data analysis blinding. Astrophysical research frequently involves probabilistic algorithms, high computational demands, and stringent data privacy requirements, making it difficult to guarantee the integrity of results. TOPO provides a secure framework for verifying reproducible data analysis while ensuring sensitive information remains hidden. Our approach utilizes deterministic hashing to generate unique digital fingerprints of outputs, and Merkle Trees to store outputs in a time-ordered manner. This enables efficient verification of specific components or the entire dataset while making it computationally infeasible to manipulate results - thereby mitigating the risk of human interference and confirmation bias, key objectives of blinding methods. We demonstrate TOPO's utility in a cosmological context using TOPO-Cobaya, showcasing how blinding and verification can be seamlessly integrated into Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations, rendering the process cryptographically provable. This method addresses pressing challenges in the reproducibility crisis and offers a robust, verifiable framework for astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Automated Identification and Segmentation of Hi Sources in CRAFTS Using Deep Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying neutral hydrogen (\hi) galaxies from observational data is a significant challenge in \hi\ galaxy surveys. With the advancement of observational technology, especially with the advent of large-scale telescope projects such as FAST and SKA, the significant increase in data volume presents new challenges for the efficiency and accuracy of data processing.To address this challenge, in this study, we present a machine learning-based method for extracting \hi\ sources from the three-dimensional (3D) spectral data obtained from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). We have carefully assembled a specialized dataset, HISF, rich in \hi\ sources, specifically designed to enhance the detection process. Our model, Unet-LK, utilizes the advanced 3D-Unet segmentation architecture and employs an elongated convolution kernel to effectively capture the intricate structures of \hi\ sources. This strategy ensures a reliable identification and segmentation of \hi\ sources, achieving notable performance metrics with a recall rate of 91.6\% and an accuracy of 95.7\%. These results substantiate the robustness of our dataset and the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture in the precise identification of \hi\ sources. Our code and dataset is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/fishszh/HISF}.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated semi-coherent hierarchical search for stellar-mass binary inspiral signals in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes with LISA remains a challenging open problem. Conventional template-bank approaches to the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that would be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical semi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline that is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated noise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm, tracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over source parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical processing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based detectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the merger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\rho\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these searches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the search trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be estimated for this type of GW search is also included.</description>

      <title>Classification of Wolf Rayet stars using Ensemble-based Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust Machine Learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars based on Infrared (IR) colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive dataset of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86\% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models such as the Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR sub-type classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy ($&gt;60\%$). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting sub-types for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the Local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.</description>
