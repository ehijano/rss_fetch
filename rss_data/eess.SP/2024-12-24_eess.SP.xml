      <title>Low-Complexity Frequency-Dependent Linearizers Based on Parallel Bias-Modulus and Bias-ReLU Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces low-complexity frequency-dependent (memory) linearizers designed to suppress nonlinear distortion in analog-to-digital interfaces. Two different linearizers are considered, based on nonlinearity models which correspond to sampling before and after the nonlinearity operations, respectively. The proposed linearizers are inspired by convolutional neural networks but have an order-of-magnitude lower implementation complexity compared to existing neural-network-based linearizer schemes. The proposed linearizers can also outperform the traditional parallel Hammerstein (as well as Wiener) linearizers even when the nonlinearities have been generated through a Hammerstein model. Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming iterative nonconvex optimization which is traditionally associated with neural network training. The design effectively handles a wide range of wideband multi-tone signals and filtered white noise. Examples demonstrate significant signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) improvements of some $20$--$30$ dB, as well as a lower implementation complexity than the Hammerstein linearizers.</description>

      <title>On Shaping Gain of Multidimensional Constellation in Linear and Nonlinear Optical Fiber Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the multi-dimensional (MD) space for constellation shaping has been proven to be an effective approach for achieving shaping gains. Despite there exists a variety of MD modulation formats tailored for specific optical transmission scenarios, there remains a notable absence of a dependable comparison method for efficiently and promptly re-evaluating their performance in arbitrary transmission systems. In this paper, we introduce an analytical nonlinear interference (NLI) power model-based shaping gain estimation method to enable a fast performance evaluation of various MD modulation formats in coherent dual-polarization (DP) optical transmission system. In order to extend the applicability of this method to a broader set of modulation formats, we extend the established NLI model to take the 4D joint distribution into account and thus able to analyze the complex interactions of non-iid signaling in DP systems. With the help of the NLI model, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art modulation formats and investigate their actual shaping gains in two types of optical fiber communication scenarios (multi-span and single-span). The numerical simulation shows that for arbitrary modulation formats, the NLI power and relative shaping gains in terms of signal-to-noise ratio can be more accurately estimated by capturing the statistics of MD symbols. Furthermore, the proposed method further validates the effectiveness of the reported NLI-tolerant modulation format in the literature, which reveals that the linear shaping gains and modulation-dependent NLI should be jointly considered for nonlinearity mitigation.</description>

      <title>Joint Downlink-Uplink Channel Estimation for Non-Reciprocal RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a recent low-cost and energy-efficient technology with potential applicability for future wireless communications. Performance gains achieved by employing RIS directly depend on accurate channel estimation (CE). It is common in the literature to assume channel reciprocity due to the facilities provided by this assumption, such as no channel feedback, beamforming simplification, and latency reduction. However, in practice, due to hardware limitations at the RIS and transceivers, the channel non-reciprocity may occur naturally, so such behavior needs to be considered. In this paper, we focus on the CE problem in a non-reciprocal RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication system. Making use of a novel closed-loop three-phase protocol for non-reciprocal CE estimation, we propose a two-stage fourth-order Tucker decomposition-based CE algorithm. In contrast to classical time-division duplexing (TDD) and frequency-division duplexing (FDD) approaches the proposed method concentrates all the processing burden for CE on the base station (BS) side, thereby freeing hardware-limited user terminal (UT) from this task. Our simulation results show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance in terms of CE accuracy compared to benchmark FDD LS-based and tensor-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Wireless communications with user equipment mounted Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) systems, the RIS is mounted on stationary structures like buildings, walls, or posts. They have shown promising results in enhancing the performance of wireless systems like capacity and MSE in poor channel conditions. The traditional RIS is a monolithic structure containing a large number of reflecting elements (passive or active). In this paper, we propose the idea of mounting a small number of RIS elements (usually between 2 to 4 ) on user equipment (UEs) like mobile phones, laptops, and tablets, to name a few. A joint coordinated optimization of phase shifts of all the passive RIS elements on the participating UEs is envisioned to enhance the performance of wireless communication between an intended transmitter and receiver in the MSE sense. Given that the RIS elements are mounted on the UEs, the challenging channel estimation problem with RIS is significantly simplified. For the case when there is a line-of-sight (LOS) channel and with a large number of participating RIS-mounted UEs, the LOS is converted into a multipath-rich-scattering channel even for millimeter wave and Terahertz operating ranges that enable higher spatial multiplexing gains, thereby significantly improving the MSE performance compared to traditional RIS channels. We support the above claims using simulations.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Non-Terrestrial Networks: Towards Global and Ubiquitous 6G Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2030 framework recently adopted by the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) envisions 6G networks to deliver intelligent, seamless connectivity that supports reliable, sustainable, and resilient communications. Recent developments in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Releases 17-19, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN)4 working group addressing satellite and cellular spectrum sharing and RAN2 enhancing New Radio (NR)/IoT for NTN, highlight the critical role NTN is set to play in the evolution of 6G standards. The integration of advanced signal processing, edge and cloud computing, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and aerial platforms, such as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and high-, medium-, and low-altitude platform stations, has revolutionized the convergence of space, aerial, and Terrestrial Networks (TN). Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered deployments for NTN and NTN-IoT, combined with Next Generation Multiple Access (NGMA) technologies, have dramatically reshaped global connectivity. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive exploration of emerging NTN-based 6G wireless networks, covering vision, alignment with 5G-Advanced and 6G standards, key principles, trends, challenges, real-world applications, and novel problem solving frameworks. It examines essential enabling technologies like AI for NTN (LEO satellites and aerial platforms), DRL, edge computing for NTN, AI for NTN trajectory optimization, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-enhanced NTN, and robust Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) beamforming. Furthermore, it addresses interference management through NGMA, including Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) for NTN, and the use of aerial platforms for access, relay, and fronthaul/backhaul connectivity.</description>

      <title>Beamspace-based Sensing in Dynamic Joint Communication and Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and RF signal processing chains. Future technologies, such as 6G, are envisioned to support multiple communication platforms along with radar sensing, thus leading to high dynamism and competition for the available resources. In such settings, whenever communication takes precedence, a likely scenario is dynamically changing RF chain and antenna availability for sensing. This necessitates real-time beam redesign to cover the field-of-view (FOV), solving which is intractable via computationally expensive optimization approaches. We propose that classic windowing techniques are still relevant and much more practical than optimization methods in such dynamic scenarios. Specifically, parametrized windows can be used in a strategic way to adapt to varying resource availability while sustaining sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Cooperative Positioning in Dense Wireless Networks: A Neural Network Enhanced Fast Convergent Parametric Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric message passing (MP) is a promising technique that provides reliable marginal probability distributions for distributed cooperative positioning (DCP) based on factor graphs (FG), while maintaining minimal computational complexity. However, conventional parametric MP-based DCP methods may fail to converge in dense wireless networks due to numerous short loops on FG. Additionally, the use of inappropriate message approximation techniques can lead to increased sensitivity to initial values and significantly slower convergence rates. To address the challenging DCP problem modeled by a loopy FG, we propose an effective graph neural network enhanced fast convergent parametric MP (GNN--FCPMP) method. We first employ Chebyshev polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms present in the FG-based spatio-temporal messages. This technique facilitates the derivation of globally precise, closed-form representations for each message transmitted across the FG. Then, the parametric representations of spatial messages are meticulously refined through data-driven graph neural networks (GNNs). Conclusively, by performing inference on the FG, we derive more accurate closed-form expressions for the a posteriori distributions of node positions. Numerical results substantiate the capability of GNN--FCPMP to significantly enhance positioning accuracy within wireless networks characterized by high-density loops and ensure rapid convergence.</description>

      <title>Amplifier-Enhanced Memristive Massive MIMO Linear Detector Circuit: An Ultra-Energy-Efficient and Robust-to-Conductance-Error Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging analog matrix computing technology based on memristive crossbar array (MCA) constitutes a revolutionary new computational paradigm applicable to a wide range of domains. Despite the proven applicability of MCA for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection, existing schemes do not take into account the unique characteristics of massive MIMO channel matrix. This oversight makes their computational accuracy highly sensitive to conductance errors of memristive devices, which is unacceptable for massive MIMO receivers. In this paper, we propose an MCA-based circuit design for massive MIMO zero forcing and minimum mean-square error detectors. Unlike the existing MCA-based detectors, we decompose the channel matrix into the product of small-scale and large-scale fading coefficient matrices, thus employing an MCA-based matrix computing module and amplifier circuits to process the two matrices separately. We present two conductance mapping schemes which are crucial but have been overlooked in all prior studies on MCA-based detector circuits. The proposed detector circuit exhibits significantly superior performance to the conventional MCA-based detector circuit, while only incurring negligible additional power consumption. Our proposed detector circuit maintains its advantage in energy efficiency over traditional digital approach by tens to hundreds of times.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Massive MIMO Linear Detector Circuit with Extremely High Energy Efficiency and Strong Memristive Conductance Deviation Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memristive crossbar array (MCA) has been successfully applied to accelerate matrix computations of signal detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the unique property of massive MIMO channel matrix makes the detection performance of existing MCA-based detectors sensitive to conductance deviations of memristive devices, and the conductance deviations are difficult to be avoided. In this paper, we propose an MCA-based detector circuit, which is robust to conductance deviations, to compute massive MIMO zero forcing and minimum mean-square error algorithms. The proposed detector circuit comprises an MCA-based matrix computing module, utilized for processing the small-scale fading coefficient matrix, and amplifier circuits based on operational amplifiers (OAs), utilized for processing the large-scale fading coefficient matrix. We investigate the impacts of the open-loop gain of OAs, conductance mapping scheme, and conductance deviation level on detection performance and demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed detector circuit over the conventional MCA-based detector circuit. The energy efficiency of the proposed detector circuit surpasses that of a traditional digital processor by several tens to several hundreds of times.</description>

      <title>Design of Frequency Index Modulated Waveforms for Integrated SAR and Communication on High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, addressing the integration requirements of radar imaging and communication for High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPs) platforms, designs a waveform based on linear frequency modulated (LFM) frequency-hopping signals that combines synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and communication functionalities. Specifically, each pulse of an LFM signal is segmented into multiple parts, forming a sequence of sub-pulses. Each sub-pulse can adopt a different carrier frequency, leading to frequency hops between sub-pulses. This design is termed frequency index modulation (FIM), enabling the embedding of communication information into different carrier frequencies for transmission. To further enhance the data transmission rate at the communication end, this paper incorporates quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) into waveform design. %For the SAR portion, this approach reduces the ADC sampling requirements while maintaining range resolution. The paper derives the ambiguity function of the proposed waveform and analyzes its Doppler and range resolution, establishing upper and lower bounds for the range resolution. In processing SAR signals, the receiver first removes QAM symbols, and to address phase discontinuities between sub-pulses, a phase compensation algorithm is proposed to achieve coherent processing. For the communication receiver, the user first performs de-chirp processing and then demodulates QAM symbols and FIM index symbols using a two-step maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. Numerical simulations further confirm the theoretical validity of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>6DMA-Aided Hybrid Beamforming with Joint Antenna Position and Orientation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a sub-connected six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided multi-user communication system. In this system, each sub-array is connected to a dedicated radio frequency chain and collectively moves and rotates as a unit within specific local regions. The movement and rotation capabilities of 6DMAs enhance design flexibility, facilitating the capture of spatial variations for improved communication performance. To fully characterize the effect of antenna position and orientation on wireless channels between the base station (BS) and users, we develop a field-response-based 6DMA channel model to account for the antenna radiation pattern and polarization. We then maximize the sum rate of multiple users, by jointly optimizing the digital and unit-modulus analog beamformers given the transmit power budget as well as the positions and orientations of sub-arrays within given movable and rotatable ranges at the BS. Due to the highly coupled variables, the formulated optimization problem is non-convex and thus challenging to solve. We develop a fractional programming-aided alternating optimization framework that integrates the Lagrange multiplier method, manifold optimization, and gradient descent to solve the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided sub-connected structure achieves a substantial sum-rate improvement over various benchmark schemes with less flexibility in antenna movement and can even outperform fully-digital beamforming systems that employ antenna position or orientation adjustments only. The results also highlight the necessity of considering antenna polarization for optimally adjusting antenna orientation.</description>

      <title>Multi-classification of High-Frequency Oscillations Using iEEG Signals and Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been studied as a promising biomarker for localizing epileptogenic areas in drug-resistant patients requiring pre-surgical intervention, while exploiting intracranial electroencephalographic iEEG. Consequently, it's important to develop accurate methods for predicting epileptic seizures. Seizure prediction involves classifying appropriate indicators, which is a difficult classification problem. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown great promise in analyzing and classifying epilepsy-related iEEG signals. In this study, we proposed three global methods, multiclass SVM, multiple architecture CNN, and CNN-SVM, which are evaluated on a simulated iEEG dataset and then on a real iEEG signal. Our best results for the three models yield high accuracy rates, GoogLeNet-SVM achieves approximately 99.63% and 94.07% for simulated data (1) and real data (2), respectively, SVM multiclass achieves 98.14% and 88.51% for (1) and (2), respectively, and GoogLeNet achieves 98.52% and 91.85% for (1) and (2), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed model performs better than other current techniques. These results suggest that deep learning models could be a successful strategy for classifying epilepsy indicators and could potentially improve seizure prediction methods, thus improving the life quality of epileptic patients.</description>

      <title>Joint Multitarget Detection and Tracking with mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate targets detection and tracking with mmWave radar is a key sensing capability that will enable more intelligent systems, create smart, efficient, automated system. This paper proposes an end-to-end detection-estimation-track framework named MNOMP-SPA-KF consisting of the target detection and estimation module, the data association (DA) module and the target tracking module. In the target estimation and detection module, a low complexity, super-resolution and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based two dimensional multisnapshot Newtonalized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-MNOMP) is designed to extract the multitarget's radial distances and velocities, followed by the conventional (Bartlett) beamformer to extract the multitarget's azimuths. In the DA module, a sum product algorithm (SPA) is adopted to obtain the association probabilities of the existed targets and measurements by incorporating the radial velocity information. The Kalman filter (KF) is implemented to perform target tracking in the target tracking module by exploiting the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. To improve the detection probability of the weak targets, extrapolation is also coupled into the MNOMP-SPA-KF. Numerical and real data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MNOMP-SPA-KF algorithm, compared to other benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: Application, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) systems have emerged as a promising technology for sixth-generation communication systems. These systems capitalize on RIS to minimize power consumption, thereby achieving consistent performance and enhancing communication quality through the establishment and shaping of auxiliary signal propagation pathways between access points (APs) and users. However, integrating RIS into existing CF mMIMO infrastructures presents several technical challenges. This study delves into the signal transmission scheme and deployment architecture of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, addressing inherent challenges such as interference induced by RIS and the increased complexity in beam alignment. Furthermore, we address the complexities arising from the joint optimization of the reflection phase of RIS and beamforming technology at the APs, intending to fully exploit the reflection capabilities of RISs and beamforming technology to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. To overcome these challenges, we propose cooperation communication to suppress RIS-induced interference, beam tracking, and joint optimization to improve system EE. We also present specific examples of cooperative communication under the constraint of electromagnetic interference and the beam tracking of a mobile system. Additionally, we emphasize important research directions for RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, aiming to inspire future investigations.</description>

      <title>Cech Complex Generation with Homotopy Equivalence Framework for Myocardial Infarction Diagnosis using Electrocardiogram Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and optimal identification of cardiac anomalies, especially Myocardial infarction (MCI) can aid the individual in obtaining prompt medical attention to mitigate the severity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple non-invasive physiological signal modality, that can be used to examine the electrical activity of heart tissue. Existing methods for MCI detection mostly rely on the temporal, frequency, and spatial domain analysis of the ECG signals. These conventional techniques lack in effective identification of cardiac cycle inter-dependency during diagnosis. Hence, there is an emerging need for incorporating the underlying connectivity of the intra-sessional cardiac cycles for improved anomaly detection. This article proposes a novel framework for ECG signal analysis and classification using persistent homological features through Cech Complex generation with homotopy equivalence check, by taking the above-mentioned emerging needs into account. Homological features like persistent birth-death rates, betti curves, and persistent entropy provide transparency of the regional and cardiac cycle connectivity when combined with Machine Learning (ML) models. The proposed framework is assessed using publicly available datasets (MIT-BIH and PTB), and the performance metrics of machine learning models indicate its efficacy in classifying Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), MCI, and non-MCI subjects, achieving a 2.8% mean improvement in AUC (area under the ROC curve) over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Deep-Learning Methods for the Enhancement of Experimental Low Dose Dental CBCT Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam tomography enables rapid 3D acquisitions, making it a suitable imaging modality for dental imaging. However, as with all X-ray techniques, the main challenge is to reduce the dose while maintaining good image quality. Moreover, dental reconstructions face a series of issues stemming from truncated projections as well as metal and cone beam artifacts. The aim here is to investigate the ability of neural networks to improve the quality of 3D CBCT dental images at low doses. We test different configurations of convolutional neural networks, trained in a supervised way to reduce artifacts and noise present in analytically reconstructed volumes. In a study on 32 experimental cone beam volumes, we show their capacity to preserve and enhance details while still reducing the artifacts. The best results are obtained with a 3D U-Net which compares advantageously with a TV regularized iterative method and is considerably faster.</description>

      <title>Signal Transformation for Effective Multi-Channel Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an non-invasive method to record the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG signals are low bandwidth and recorded from multiple electrodes simultaneously in a time synchronized manner. Typical EEG signal processing involves extracting features from all the individual channels separately and then fusing these features for downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a signal transformation, using basic signal processing, to combine the individual channels of a low-bandwidth signal, like the EEG into a single-channel high-bandwidth signal, like audio. Further this signal transformation is bi-directional, namely the high-bandwidth single-channel can be transformed to generate the individual low-bandwidth signals without any loss of information. Such a transformation when applied to EEG signals overcomes the need to process multiple signals and allows for a single-channel processing. The advantage of this signal transformation is that it allows the use of pre-trained single-channel pre-trained models, for multi-channel signal processing and analysis. We further show the utility of the signal transformation on publicly available EEG dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Heart Rate Detection via Multi-Site Photoplethysmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartwatches have become popular for monitoring physiological parameters outside clinical settings. Using reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, such watches can non-invasively estimate heart rate (HR) in everyday environments and throughout a patient's day. However, achieving consistently high accuracy remains challenging, particularly during moments of increased motion or due to varying device placement. In this paper, we introduce a novel sensor fusion method for estimating HR that flexibly combines samples from multiple PPG sensors placed across the patient's body, including wrist, ankle, head, and sternum (chest). Our method first estimates signal quality across all inputs to dynamically integrate them into a joint and robust PPG signal for HR estimation. We evaluate our method on a novel dataset of PPG and ECG recordings from 14 participants who engaged in real-world activities outside the laboratory over the course of a whole day. Our method achieves a mean HR error of 2.4\,bpm, which is 46\% lower than the mean error of the best-performing single device (4.4\,bpm, head).</description>

      <title>Tri-Spectral PPG: Robust Reflective Photoplethysmography by Fusing Multiple Wavelengths for Cardiac Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have found widespread adoption in wearable devices for monitoring cardiac health. Channels thereby serve different functions -- whereas green is commonly used for metrics such as heart rate and heart rate variability, red and infrared are commonly used for pulse oximetry. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that simultaneously fuses multi-channel PPG signals into a single recovered PPG signal that can be input to further processing. Via signal fusion, our learning-based method compensates for the artifacts that affect wavelengths to different extents, such as motion and ambient light changes. We evaluate our method on a novel dataset of multi-channel PPG recordings and electrocardiogram recordings for reference from 10 participants over the course of 13 hours during real-world activities outside the laboratory. Using the fusion PPG signal our method recovered, participants' heart rates can be calculated with a mean error of 4.5\,bpm (23\% lower than from green PPG signals at 5.9\,bpm).</description>

      <title>Localization Accuracy Improvement in Multistatic ISAC with LoS/NLoS Condition using 5G NR Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is anticipated to play a crucial role in sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. A significant challenge in ISAC systems is the degradation of localization accuracy due to poor propagation conditions, such as multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. These conditions result in outlier measurements that can severely impact localization performance. This paper investigates the enhancement of target localization accuracy in multistatic ISAC systems under both line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS conditions. We leverage positioning reference signal (PRS), which is currently employed in fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) for user equipment (UE) positioning, as the sensing signal. We introduce a novel algorithm to improve localization accuracy by mitigating the impact of outliers in range measurements, while also accounting for errors due to PRS range resolution. Eventually, through simulation results, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous approaches. Indeed, we achieve up to 28% and 20% improvements in average localization error over least squares (LS) and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) methods, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 16% and 13% enhancements in the 90th percentile of localization error compared to LS and IRLS, respectively. Our simulation is based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, ensuring the applicability of our results across diverse environments, including urban and indoor areas.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have become critical tools for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and autonomous navigation. Accurate estimation of wave direction is essential for improving USV navigation and ensuring operational safety, but traditional methods often suffer from high costs and limited spatial resolution. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict wave direction using sensor data collected from USVs. Experimental results show the capability of the LSTM model to learn temporal dependencies and provide accurate predictions, outperforming simpler baselines.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Time Series Data Generation for Healthcare Applications: A PCG Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality medical time series data is essential for advancing healthcare diagnostics and safeguarding patient privacy. Specifically, synthesizing realistic phonocardiogram (PCG) signals offers significant potential as a cost-effective and efficient tool for cardiac disease pre-screening. Despite its potential, the synthesis of PCG signals for this specific application received limited attention in research. In this study, we employ and compare three state-of-the-art generative models from different categories - WaveNet, DoppelGANger, and DiffWave - to generate high-quality PCG data. We use data from the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022. Our methods are evaluated using various metrics widely used in the previous literature in the domain of time series data generation, such as mean absolute error and maximum mean discrepancy. Our results demonstrate that the generated PCG data closely resembles the original datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our generative models in producing realistic synthetic PCG data. In our future work, we plan to incorporate this method into a data augmentation pipeline to synthesize abnormal PCG signals with heart murmurs, in order to address the current scarcity of abnormal data. We hope to improve the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic tools in cardiology, enhancing their effectiveness in detecting heart murmurs.</description>

      <title>Incremental Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new algorithms for approximating and updating the hierarchical Tucker decomposition of tensor streams. The first algorithm, Batch Hierarchical Tucker - leaf to root (BHT-l2r), proposes an alternative and more efficient way of approximating a batch of similar tensors in hierarchical Tucker format. The second algorithm, Hierarchical Tucker - Rapid Incremental Subspace Expansion (HT-RISE), updates the batch hierarchical Tucker representation of an accumulated tensor as new batches of tensors become available. The HT-RISE algorithm is suitable for the online setting and never requires full storage or reconstruction of all data while providing a solution to the incremental Tucker decomposition problem. We provide theoretical guarantees for both algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on physical and cyber-physical data. The proposed BHT-l2r algorithm and the batch hierarchical Tucker format offers up to $6.2\times$ compression and $3.7\times$ reduction in time over the hierarchical Tucker format. The proposed HT-RISE algorithm also offers up to $3.1\times$ compression and $3.2\times$ reduction in time over a state of the art incremental tensor train decomposition algorithm.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks: Their Channel Model and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given their extensive geographic coverage, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are envisioned to find their way into next-generation (6G) wireless communications. This paper explores space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) leveraging LEOs to support terrestrial and non-terrestrial users. We first propose a practical satellite-ground channel model that incorporates five key aspects: 1) the small-scale fading characterized by the Shadowed-Rician distribution in terms of the Rician factor K, 2) the path loss effect of bending rays due to atmospheric refraction, 3) the molecular absorption modelled by the Beer-Lambert law, 4) the Doppler effects including the Earth's rotation, and 5) the impact of weather conditions according to the International Telecommunication Union Recommendations (ITU-R). Harnessing the proposed model, we analyze the long-term performance of the SAGIN considered. Explicitly, the closed-form expressions of both the outage probability and of the ergodic rates are derived. Additionally, the upper bounds of bit-error rates and of the Goodput are investigated. The numerical results yield the following insights: 1) The shadowing effect and the ratio between the line-of-sight and scattering components can be conveniently modeled by the factors of K and m in the proposed Shadowed-Rician small-scale fading model. 2) The atmospheric refraction has a modest effect on the path loss. 3) When calculating the transmission distance of waves, Earth's curvature and its geometric relationship with the satellites must be considered, particularly at small elevation angles. 3) High-frequency carriers suffer from substantial path loss, and 4) the Goodput metric is eminently suitable for characterizing the performance of different coding as well as modulation methods and of the estimation error of the Doppler effects.</description>

      <title>Fast Multi-Group Gaussian Process Factor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are now commonly used in dimensionality reduction approaches tailored to neuroscience, especially to describe changes in high-dimensional neural activity over time. As recording capabilities expand to include neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, cortical layers, and cell types, interest in extending Gaussian process factor models to characterize multi-population interactions has grown. However, the cubic runtime scaling of current methods with the length of experimental trials and the number of recorded populations (groups) precludes their application to large-scale multi-population recordings. Here, we improve this scaling from cubic to linear in both trial length and group number. We present two approximate approaches to fitting multi-group Gaussian process factor models based on (1) inducing variables and (2) the frequency domain. Empirically, both methods achieved orders of magnitude speed-up with minimal impact on statistical performance, in simulation and on neural recordings of hundreds of neurons across three brain areas. The frequency domain approach, in particular, consistently provided the greatest runtime benefits with the fewest trade-offs in statistical performance. We further characterize the estimation biases introduced by the frequency domain approach and demonstrate effective strategies to mitigate them. This work enables a powerful class of analysis techniques to keep pace with the growing scale of multi-population recordings, opening new avenues for exploring brain function.</description>

      <title>Fed-ZOE: Communication-Efficient Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Zeroth-Order Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G and beyond networks grow increasingly complex and interconnected, federated learning (FL) emerges as an indispensable paradigm for securely and efficiently leveraging decentralized edge data for AI. By virtue of the superposition property of communication signals, over-the-air FL (OtA-FL) achieves constant communication overhead irrespective of the number of edge devices (EDs). However, training neural networks over the air still incurs substantial communication costs, as the number of transmitted symbols equals the number of trainable parameters. To alleviate this issue, the most straightforward approach is to reduce the number of transmitted symbols by 1) gradient compression and 2) gradient sparsification. Unfortunately, these methods are incompatible with OtA-FL due to the loss of its superposition property. In this work, we introduce federated zeroth-order estimation (Fed-ZOE), an efficient framework inspired by the randomized gradient estimator (RGE) commonly used in zeroth-order optimization (ZOO). In FedZOE, EDs perform local weight updates as in standard FL, but instead of transmitting full gradient vectors, they send compressed local model update vectors in the form of several scalar-valued inner products between the local model update vectors and random vectors. These scalar values enable the parameter server (PS) to reconstruct the gradient using the RGE trick with highly reduced overhead, as well as preserving the superposition property. Unlike conventional ZOO leveraging RGE for step-wise gradient descent, Fed-ZOE compresses local model update vectors before transmission, thereby achieving higher accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical evaluations using ResNet-18 on datasets such as CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100, and Brain-CT demonstrate that Fed-ZOE achieves performance comparable to Fed-OtA while drastically reducing communication costs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Error Analysis of Channel Estimation for IRS-assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. While various algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical error analysis. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals (in the uplink scenario) or base stations (in the downlink scenario) and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we analyze the theoretical recovery error for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem, including upper error bound and minimax lower bound, demonstrating that the error decreases inversely with the number of time slots and increases proportionally with the number of unknown elements in the channel matrices. In addition, we extend our error analysis to two more specialized IRS-assisted MIMO systems, incorporating low-rank channel matrices or an unknown IRS. Furthermore, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we introduce and implement two nonconvex optimization algorithms--alternating least squares and alternating gradient descent--to validate our conclusions through simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Target Tracking based on Localization with Linear Time-Difference-of-Arrival Measurements: A Delay-Tolerant Networked Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers target tracking based on a beacon signal's time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) to a group of cooperating sensors. The sensors receive a reflected signal from the target where the time-of-arrival (TOA) renders the distance information. The existing approaches include: (i) classic centralized solutions which gather and process the target data at a central unit, (ii) distributed solutions which assume that the target data is observable in the dense neighborhood of each sensor (to be filtered locally), and (iii) double time-scale distributed methods with high rates of communication/consensus over the network. This work, in order to reduce the network connectivity in (i)-(ii) and communication rate in (iii), proposes a distributed single time-scale technique, which can also handle heterogeneous constant data-exchange delays over the static sensor network. This work assumes only distributed observability (in contrast to local observability in some existing works categorized in (ii)), i.e., the target is observable globally over a (strongly) connected network. The (strong) connectivity further allows for survivable network and $q$-redundant observer design. Each sensor locally shares information and processes the received data in its immediate neighborhood via local linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) feedback gains to ensure tracking error stability. The same gain matrix works in the presence of heterogeneous delays with no need of redesigning algorithms. Since most existing distributed estimation scenarios are linear (based on consensus), many works use linearization of the existing nonlinear TDOA measurement models where the output matrix is a function of the target position.</description>

      <title>Three mechanistically different variability and noise sources in the trial-to-trial fluctuations of responses to brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are among the few directly observable responses to external brain stimulation and serve a variety of applications, often in the form of input-output (IO) curves. Previous statistical models with two variability sources inherently consider the small MEPs at the low-side plateau as part of the neural recruitment properties. However, recent studies demonstrated that small MEP responses under resting conditions are contaminated and over-shadowed by background noise of mostly technical quality, e.g., caused by the amplifier, and suggested that the neural recruitment curve should continue below this noise level. This work intends to separate physiological variability from background noise and improve the description of recruitment behaviour. We developed a triple-variability-source model around a logarithmic logistic function without a lower plateau and incorporated an additional source for background noise. Compared to models with two or fewer variability sources, our approach better described IO characteristics, evidenced by lower Bayesian Information Criterion scores across all subjects and pulse shapes. The model independently extracted hidden variability information across the stimulated neural system and isolated it from background noise, which led to an accurate estimation of the IO curve parameters. This new model offers a robust tool to analyse brain stimulation IO curves in clinical and experimental neuroscience and reduces the risk of spurious results from inappropriate statistical methods. The presented model together with the corresponding calibration method provides a more accurate representation of MEP responses and variability sources, advances our understanding of cortical excitability, and may improve the assessment of neuromodulation effects.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable high data rates and sensing resolutions, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks leverage extremely large antenna arrays and high frequencies, extending the Rayleigh distance and making near-field (NF) spherical wave propagation dominant. This unlocks numerous spatial degrees of freedom, raising the challenge of optimizing them for communication and sensing tradeoffs. To this end, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based NF-ISAC transmit scheme utilizing hybrid digital-analog antennas. RSMA enhances interference management, while a variable number of dedicated sensing beams adds beamforming flexibility. The objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate while ensuring multi-target sensing performance by jointly optimizing receive filters, analog and digital beamformers, common rate allocation, and the sensing beam count. To address uncertainty in sensing beam allocation, a rank-zero solution reconstruction method demonstrates that dedicated sensing beams are unnecessary for NF multi-target detection. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based double-loop algorithm is introduced, employing weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) and quadratic transforms to reformulate communication and sensing rates. Simulations reveal that the proposed scheme: 1) Achieves performance comparable to fully digital beamforming with fewer RF chains, (2) Maintains NF multi-target detection without compromising communication rates, and 3) Significantly outperforms space division multiple access (SDMA) and far-field ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Secure End-to-End Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based joint source and channel coding is proposed for end-to-end secure image transmission against multiple eavesdroppers. Both scenarios of colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers are considered. Instead of idealistic assumptions of perfectly known and i.i.d. source and channel distributions, the proposed scheme assumes unknown source and channel statistics. The goal is to transmit images with minimum distortion, while simultaneously preventing eavesdroppers from inferring private attributes of images. Simultaneously generalizing the ideas of privacy funnel and wiretap coding, a multi-objective optimization framework is expressed that characterizes the trade-off between image reconstruction quality and information leakage to eavesdroppers, taking into account the structural similarity index (SSIM) for improving the perceptual quality of image reconstruction. Extensive experiments over CIFAR-10 and CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) datasets, together with ablation studies are provided to highlight the performance gain in terms of SSIM, adversarial accuracy, and cross-entropy metric compared with benchmarks. Experiments show that the proposed scheme restrains the adversarially-trained eavesdroppers from intercepting privatized data for both cases of eavesdropping a common secret, as well as the case in which eavesdroppers are interested in different secrets. Furthermore, useful insights on the privacy-utility trade-off are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revolutionary sixth-generation wireless communications technologies and applications, notably digital twin networks (DTN), connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), zero-touch networks, industry 5.0, and healthcare 5.0, are driving next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs). These technologies generate massive data, requiring swift transmission and trillions of device connections, fueling the need for sophisticated next-generation multiple access (NGMA) schemes. NGMA enables massive connectivity in the 6G era, optimizing NGWN operations beyond current multiple access (MA) schemes. This survey showcases non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as NGMA's frontrunner, exploring What has NOMA delivered?, What is NOMA providing?, and What lies ahead?. We present NOMA variants, fundamental operations, and applicability in multi-antenna systems, machine learning, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), cognitive radio networks (CRN), integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), terahertz networks, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, we explore NOMA's interplay with state-of-the-art wireless technologies, highlighting its advantages and technical challenges. Finally, we unveil NOMA research trends in the 6G era and provide design recommendations and future perspectives for NOMA as the leading NGMA solution for NGWNs.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Assisted SWIPT Systems: Active or Passive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system is investigated. Both active and passive STAR-RISs are considered. Passive STAR-RISs can be cost-efficiently fabricated to large aperture sizes with significant near-field regions, but the design flexibility is limited by the coupled phase-shifts. Active STAR-RISs can further amplify signals and have independent phase-shifts, but their aperture sizes are relatively small due to the high cost. To characterize and compare their performance, a power consumption minimization problem is formulated by jointly designing the beamforming at the access point (AP) and the STAR-RIS, subject to both the power and information quality-of-service requirements. To solve the resulting highly-coupled non-convex problem, the original problem is first decomposed into simpler subproblems and then an alternating optimization framework is proposed. For the passive STAR-RIS, the coupled phase-shift constraint is tackled by employing a vector-driven weight penalty method. While for the active STAR-RIS, the independent phase-shift is optimized with AP beamforming via matrix-driven semidefinite programming, and the amplitude matrix is updated using convex optimization techniques in each iteration. Numerical results show that: 1) given the same aperture sizes, the active STAR-RIS exhibits superior performance over the passive one when the aperture size is small, but the performance gap decreases with the increase in aperture size; and 2) given identical power budgets, the passive STAR-RIS is generally preferred, whereas the active STAR-RIS typically suffers performance loss for balancing between the hardware power and the amplification power.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Level ASK Modulations for RIS-Assisted Communications with Energy-Based Noncoherent Reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of one- and two-sided amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulations in noncoherent single-input single-output (SISO) wireless communication systems assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Novel noncoherent receiver structures are proposed based on the energy of the received symbol and the choice of the modulation scheme for data transmission. The system's performance is assessed in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) and an optimization framework is proposed to determine the most effective one- and two-sided ASKs to minimize the SER, while adhering to average a transmit power constraint. Two scenarios based on the availability of the statistical characteristics of the wireless channel are explored: a) the transceiver pair has complete knowledge of the channel statistics, and b) both end nodes possess knowledge of the statistics of the channel gain up to its fourth moment, and novel algorithms are developed to obtain optimal ASKs for both of them. Extensive numerical evaluations are presented showcasing that there exists a threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above which the optimal ASKs outperform the traditional equispaced ASKs. The dependencies of the SER performance and the SNR threshold on various system parameters are assessed, providing design guidelines for RIS-assisted noncoherent wireless communication systems with multi-level ASK modulations.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Duo of Collaborative Masking and Target for Advanced Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAE) have recently succeeded in self-supervised vision representation learning. Previous work mainly applied custom-designed (e.g., random, block-wise) masking or teacher (e.g., CLIP)-guided masking and targets. However, they ignore the potential role of the self-training (student) model in giving feedback to the teacher for masking and targets. In this work, we present to integrate Collaborative Masking and Targets for boosting Masked AutoEncoders, namely CMT-MAE. Specifically, CMT-MAE leverages a simple collaborative masking mechanism through linear aggregation across attentions from both teacher and student models. We further propose using the output features from those two models as the collaborative target of the decoder. Our simple and effective framework pre-trained on ImageNet-1K achieves state-of-the-art linear probing and fine-tuning performance. In particular, using ViT-base, we improve the fine-tuning results of the vanilla MAE from 83.6% to 85.7%.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Curve Maximization: Attacking Robust Aggregators in Distributed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed learning agents aim at collaboratively solving a global learning problem. It becomes more and more likely that individual agents are malicious or faulty with an increasing size of the network. This leads to a degeneration or complete breakdown of the learning process. Classical aggregation schemes are prone to breakdown at small contamination rates, therefore robust aggregation schemes are sought for. While robust aggregation schemes can generally tolerate larger contamination rates, many have been shown to be susceptible to carefully crafted malicious attacks. In this work, we show how the sensitivity curve (SC), a classical tool from robust statistics, can be used to systematically derive optimal attack patterns against arbitrary robust aggregators, in most cases rendering them ineffective. We show the effectiveness of the proposed attack in multiple simulations.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity-Constrained Spectral Efficiency Analysis for 6G Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an analytical analysis of the Doppler spectrum in von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering channels. A simple closed-form expression for the Doppler spectrum is derived and used to investigate the impact of vMF scattering parameters, i.e., the mean direction and the degree of concentration of scatterers. The spectrum is observed to exhibit exponential behavior for mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean direction of scatterers, while conforming to a Gaussian-like shape for the perpendicular motion. The validity of the obtained results is verified by comparison against the results of Monte Carlo simulations, where an exact match is observed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents simple analytical expressions for the spatial and temporal correlation functions in channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering. In contrast to previous results, the expressions presented here are exact and based only on elementary functions, clearly revealing the impact of the underlying parameters. The derived results are validated by a comparison against numerical integration result, where an exact match is observed. To demonstrate their utility, the presented results are used to analyze spatial correlation across different antenna array geometries and to investigate temporal correlation of a fluctuating radar signal from a moving target.</description>

      <title>Rate-Adaptive Generative Semantic Communication Using Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) have shown promise for end-to-end semantic image transmission. However, most existing schemes primarily focus on optimizing pixel-wise metrics, which often fail to align with human perception, leading to lower perceptual quality. In this letter, we propose a novel generative DJSCC approach using conditional diffusion models to enhance the perceptual quality of transmitted images. Specifically, by utilizing entropy models, we effectively manage transmission bandwidth based on the estimated entropy of transmitted sym-bols. These symbols are then used at the receiver as conditional information to guide a conditional diffusion decoder in image reconstruction. Our model is built upon the emerging advanced mamba-like linear attention (MLLA) skeleton, which excels in image processing tasks while also offering fast inference speed. Besides, we introduce a multi-stage training strategy to ensure the stability and improve the overall performance of the model. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Power Allocation for Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless communications networks. Its integration with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques promises to leverage substantial spatial beamforming gains for both functionalities. In this work, we consider a massive MIMO-ISAC system employing a uniform planar array with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio downlink transmission schemes combined with monostatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cram\'er--Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using a very large antenna array for each functionality. Furthermore, we devise a power allocation strategy based on successive convex approximation to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</description>

      <title>6D Rigid Body Localization and Velocity Estimation via Gaussian Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel message-passing solution to the sixth-dimensional (6D) moving rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) translation vector and rotation angles, as well as their corresponding translational and angular velocities, are all estimated by only utilizing the relative range and Doppler measurements between the "anchor" sensors located at an 3D (rigid body) observer and the "target" sensors of another rigid body. The proposed method is based on a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework, employed to estimate the absolute sensor positions and velocities using a range- and Doppler-based received signal model, which is then utilized in the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized under a small-angle approximation. The method further incorporates a second bivariate GaBP designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation vectors, including an interference cancellation (IC) refinement stage to improve the angle estimation performance, followed by the estimation of the angular and the translational velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via simulations, which confirms its improved performance compared to equivalent state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Indoor Wireless Networks with a Rotary Uniform Linear Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary wireless communication systems rely on Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) techniques. In such systems, each Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple devices simultaneously. Notably, traditional systems utilize fixed antennas, i.e., antennas without any movement capabilities, while the idea of movable antennas has recently gained traction among the research community. By moving in a confined region, movable antennas are able to exploit the wireless channel variation in the continuous domain. This additional degree of freedom may enhance the quality of the wireless links, and consequently the communication performance. However, movable antennas for MU-MIMO proposed in the literature are complex, bulky, expensive and present a high power consumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative to such systems that has lower complexity and lower cost. More specifically, we propose the incorporation of rotation capabilities to APs equipped with Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs) of antennas. We consider the uplink of an indoor scenario where the AP serves multiple devices simultaneously. The optimal rotation of the ULA is computed based on estimates of the positions of the active devices and aiming at maximizing the per-user mean achievable Spectral Efficiency (SE). Adopting a spatially correlated Rician channel model, our numerical results show that the rotation capabilities of the AP can bring substantial improvements in the SE in scenarios where the line-of-sight component of the channel vectors is strong. Moreover, our proposed system is robust against imperfect positioning estimates.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of potential metastructures inspired from Indian medieval architectural elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we immerse in the intricate world of patterns, examining the structural details of Indian medieval architecture for the discovery of motifs with great application potential from the mechanical metastructure perspective. The motifs that specifically engrossed us are derived from the tomb of I'timad-ud-Daula, situated in the city of Agra, close to the Taj Mahal. In an exploratory study, we designed nine interlaced metastructures inspired from the tomb's motifs. We fabricated the metastructures using additive manufacturing and studied their vibration characteristics experimentally and numerically. We also investigated bandgap modulation with metallic inserts in honeycomb interlaced metastructures. The comprehensive study of these metastructure panels reveals their high performance in controlling elastic wave propagation and generating suitable frequency bandgaps, hence having potential applications as waveguides for noise and vibration control. Finally, we developed a novel AI-based model trained on numerical datasets for the inverse design of metastructures with a desired bandgap.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and communication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation communication infrastructure.</description>
