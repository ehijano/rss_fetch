      <title>A first-principles study and mesoscopic modeling of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of FeSe within density-functional theory at the generalized gradient approximation level. First, we studied how the bandwidth of the d-bands at the Fermi energy are renormalized by adding simple corrections: Hubbard U, Hunds J and by introducing long-range magnetic orders. We found that introducing either a striped or a staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order brings the bandwidths -- which are starkly overestimated at the generalized gradient approximation level -- closer to those experimentally observed. Second, for the ferromagnetic, the striped, checkerboard and the staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order, we investigate the change in magnetic formation energy with local magnetic moment of Fe at a pressure up to 6 GPa. The bilinear and biquadratic exchange energies are derived from the Heisenberg model and noncollinear first-principles calculations, respectively. We found a non-trivial behavior of the spin-exchange parameters on the magnetization, and we put forward a field-theory model that rationalizes these results in terms of two-dimensional spin and orbital fluctuations. The character of these fluctuations can be either that of a standard density wave or a topological vortex. Topological vortexes can result in mesoscopic magnetization structures.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Nanodomains Stabilized by Chemical Disorder at Anti-phase Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectric perovskite oxides exhibit exceptional dielectric properties and high structural/chemical tunability, making them promising for a wide range of applications from high energy-density capacitors to solid-state cooling. However, tailoring the antiferroelectric phase stability through alloying is hampered by the complex interplay between chemistry and the alignment of dipole moments. In this study, correlations between chemical order and the stability of the antiferroelectric phase are established at anti-phase boundaries in \ce{Pb2MgWO6}. Using multislice ptychography, we reveal the three-dimensional nature of chemical order at the boundaries and show that they exhibit a finite width of chemical intermixing. Furthermore, regions at and adjacent to the anti-phase boundary exhibit antiferroelectric displacements in contrast to the overall paraelectric film. Combining spatial statistics and density functional theory simulations, local antiferroelectric distortions are shown to be confined to and stabilized by chemical disorder. Enabled by the three-dimensional information of multislice ptychography, these results provide insights into the interplay between chemical order and electronic properties to engineer antiferroelectric material response.</description>

      <title>Enhanced polarization switching characteristics of HfO2 ultrathin films via acceptor-donor co-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of ferroelectric memories, HfO2-based ferroelectrics stand out because of their exceptional CMOS compatibility and scalability. Nevertheless, their switchable polarization and switching speed are not on par with those of perovskite ferroelectrics. It is widely acknowledged that defects play a crucial role in stabilizing the metastable polar phase of HfO2. Simultaneously, defects also pin the domain walls and impede the switching process, ultimately rendering the sluggish switching of HfO2. Herein, we present an effective strategy involving acceptor-donor co-doping to effectively tackle this dilemma. Remarkably enhanced ferroelectricity and the fastest switching process ever reported among HfO2 polar devices are observed in La3+-Ta5+ co-doped HfO2 ultrathin films. Moreover, robust macro-electrical characteristics of co-doped films persist even at a thickness as low as 3 nm, expanding potential applications of HfO2 in ultrathin devices. Our systematic investigations further demonstrate that synergistic effects of uniform microstructure and smaller switching barrier introduced by co-doping ensure the enhanced ferroelectricity and shortened switching time. The co-doping strategy offers an effective avenue to control the defect state and improve the ferroelectric properties of HfO2 films.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure, properties and pressure-induced insulator-metal transition in layered kagome chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered materials with kagome lattice have attracted a lot of attention due to the presence of nontrivial topological bands and correlated electronic states with tunability. In this work, we investigate a unique van der Waals (vdW) material system, $A_{2}M_{3}X_{4}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs; $M$ = Ni, Pd; $X$ = S, Se), where transition metal kagome lattices, chalcogen honeycomb lattices and alkali metal triangular lattices coexist simultaneously. A notable feature of this material is that each Ni/Pd atom is positioned in the center of four chalcogen atoms, forming a local square-planar environment. This crystal field environment results in a low spin state $S$ = 0 of Ni$^{2+}$/Pd$^{2+}$. A systematic study of the crystal growth, crystal structure, magnetic and transport properties of two representative compounds, Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$ and Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$, has been carried out on powder and single crystal samples. Both compounds exhibit nonmagnetic $p$-type semiconducting behavior, closely related to the particular chemical environment of Ni$^{2+}$ ions and the alkali metal intercalated vdW structure. Additionally, Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$ undergoes an insulator-metal transition (IMT) in transport measurements under pressure up to 87.10 GPa without any structural phase transition, while Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$ persists in its semiconducting behavior.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Electronic Band Gap Energy From Material Properties Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are utilized to estimate the electronic band gap energy and forecast the band gap category of materials based on experimentally quantifiable properties. The determination of band gap energy is critical for discerning various material properties, such as its metallic nature, and potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. While numerical methods exist for computing band gap energy, they often entail high computational costs and have limitations in accuracy and scalability. A machine learning-driven model capable of swiftly predicting material band gap energy using easily obtainable experimental properties would offer a superior alternative to conventional density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our model does not require any preliminary DFT-based calculation or knowledge of the structure of the material. We present a scheme for improving the performance of simple regression and classification models by partitioning the dataset into multiple clusters. A new evaluation scheme for comparing the performance of ML-based models in material sciences involving both regression and classification tasks is introduced based on traditional evaluation metrics. It is shown that on this new evaluation metric, our method of clustering the dataset results in better performance.</description>

      <title>Onset of Spin Entanglement in Doped Carbon Nanotubes Studied by EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale semiconductors with isolated spin impurities have been touted as promising materials for their potential use at the intersection of quantum, spin, and information technologies. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of spins in semiconducting carbon nanotubes have overwhelmingly focused on spins more strongly localized by $\rm sp^3$-type lattice defects. However, the creation of such impurities is irreversible and requires specific reactions to generate them. Shallow charge impurities, on the other hand, are more readily and widely produced by simple redox chemistry, but have not yet been investigated for their spin properties. Here we use EPR to study p-doped (6,5) semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) and elucidate the role of impurity-impurity interactions in conjunction with exchange and correlation effects for the spin behavior of this material. A quantitative comparison of the EPR signals with phenomenological modeling combined with configuration interaction electronic structure calculations of impurity pairs shows that orbital overlap, combined with exchange and correlation effects, causes the EPR signal to disappear due to spin entanglement for doping levels corresponding to impurity spacings of $14\,\rm nm$ (at 30 K). This transition is predicted to shift to higher doping levels with increasing temperature and to lower levels with increasing screening, providing an opportunity for improved spin control in doped s-SWNTs.</description>

      <title>Atomistic investigation of deformation and fracture of individual structural components of metal matrix composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the development of the atomistic framework for determining the lower scale mechanical parameters of single components of a metal matrix composite for final application to a micromechanical damage model. Here, the deformation and failure behavior of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ interfaces and their components, metal and ceramic, are analyzed in depth using molecular statics calculations. A number of atomistic simulations of strength tests, uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compressive and simple shear, have been performed in order to obtain a set of stiffness tensors and strain-stress characteristics up to failure for 30 different crystalline and amorphous systems. Characteristic points on the strain-stress curves in the vicinity of failure are further analyzed at the atomistic level, using local measures of lattice disorder. Numerical results are discussed in the context of composite damage at upper microscopic scale based on images of the fracture surface of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ composites.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic effects in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among a huge variety of known two-dimensional materials, some of them have anisotropic crystal structures; examples include so different systems as a few-layer black phoshphorus (phosphorene), beryllium nitride BeN$_4$, van der Waals magnet CrSBr, rhenium dichalgogenides ReX$_2$. As a consequence, their optical and electronic properties turn out to be highly anisotropic as well. In some cases, the anisotropy results not just in a smooth renormalization of observable properties in comparison with the isotropic case but in the appearance of dramatically new physics. The examples are hyperbolic plasmons and excitons, strongly anisotropic ordering of adatoms at the surface of two-dimensional or van der Waals materials, essential change of transport and superconducting properties. Here, we present a systematic review of electronic structure, transport and optical properties of several representative groups of anisotropic two-dimensional materials including semiconductors, anisotropic Dirac and semi-Dirac materials, as well as superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermal cycling induced evolution and colossal exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structure, provide an optimal platform for probing such physical phenomena. However, achieving a facile and effective means to manipulate exchange bias in pristine van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the origin of exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures. Our work demonstrates a method to modulate unidirectional exchange anisotropy, achieving an unprecedented nearly 1000% variation through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, magneto-transport measurements reveal a huge 170 mT exchange bias at 5 K, the largest observed in pristine van der Waals antiferromagnet-ferromagnet interfaces. This substantial magnitude of the exchange bias is linked to an anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. On the other hand, the tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is ascribed to the modified arrangement of interfacial atoms and changes in the vdW gap during field cooling. Our findings highlight a robust and easily adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures, presenting a straightforward approach to enhance other interface related spintronic phenomena for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Chlorine and zinc co-doping effects on the electronic structure and optical properties of {\gamma}-CuI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of chlorine (Cl) and zinc (Zn) co-doping on the electronic structure and optical properties of the zinc blende ({\gamma}) phase of copper iodide ({\gamma}-CuI) scintillator material are investigated by using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The band structure, density of states, dielectric function, absorption coefficients, and reflectivity were analyzed before and after doping. Results show co-doping significantly modifies the band structure, reduces the band gap, and generates impurity energy levels. Cl doping enhances absorption in the high energy region while reducing visible light absorption. Zn doping induces a redshift in absorption and n-type conductivity at high concentrations. With suitable co-doping ratios, the absorption coefficient and reflectivity of {\gamma}-CuI can be optimized in the visible range to improve scintillation light yield. The calculations provide guidance for co-doping {\gamma}-CuI scintillators to achieve superior detection performance. The n-type conductivity also makes doped {\gamma}-CuI promising for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect and Skyrmions in Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two ferromagnetic (FM) layers separated by a non-magnetic (NM) spacer layer gives rise to different types of coupling with the variation of spacer layer thickness. When the NM is metallic, the IEC is attributed to the well known Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction which shows an oscillatory decaying nature with increasing thickness. Due to this, it is possible to tune the coupling between the two FM to be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. In this work we have studied a Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt system where the Co thickness has been taken in the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy regime which is much less than the spin reorientation transition thickness. By tuning the Ir thickness to 2.0 nm, a canted state of magnetization reversal in the system is observed which gives rise to a possibility of nucleating topologically non trivial spin textures like skyrmions. Further, with the combination of transport and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements, we have confirmed the presence of skyrmions in our system. These findings may be useful for potential applications in emerging spintronic and data storage technologies using skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band structure and excitonic optical response in V2O5 bulk and monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of V$_2$O$_5$ is calculated using an all-electron quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ method, including electron-hole ladder diagrams in the screening of $W$. The optical dielectric function calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation exhibits excitons with large binding energy, consistent with spectroscopic ellipsometry data and other recent calculations. Sharp peaks in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high energy are found to be an artifact of the truncation of the numbers of bands included in the BSE calculation of the macroscopic dielectric function. The $\varepsilon_1(\omega=0)$ gives indices of refraction in good agreement with experiment. The excitons are charge transfer excitons with the hole primarily on oxygen and electrons on vanadium, but depending on which exciton, the distribution over different oxygens changes. The exciton wave functions have a spread of about 5-15\AA, with asymmetric character for the electron distribution around the hole depending on which oxygen the hole is fixed at. The monolayer quasiparticle gap increases inversely proportional to interlayer distance once the initial interlayer covalent couplings are removed which is thanks to the long-range nature of the self-energy and the reduced screening in a 2D system. The optical gap on the other hand is relatively independent of interlayer spacing because of the compensation between the self-energy gap shift and the exciton binding energy, both of which are proportional to the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$. Recent experimental results on very thin layer V$_2$O$_5$ obtained by chemical exfoliation provide experimental support for an increase in gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of grain boundary (GB) orientation fundamental zone (FZ) has connected GB structures across multiple crystallographic characters with their properties in a unique insight, but quantitative understandings of the structure-property relationship in the FZ are still lacking yet. Here, a theoretical derivation is proposed to transfer the well-known Read-Shockley relationship to the 3D FZ to form a standard energy function, which is proven to capture the simulated energy trends in a simple and accurate manner. The theorization therefore provides a basis for the establishment of modern GB energy functions.</description>

      <title>Design of Magnetic Polar Double-Double Perovskite Oxides through Cation Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commencing from the centrosymmetric MnRMnSbO$_6$ compound, we explore the realm of magnetic polar double-double perovskite oxides characterized by significant ferroelectric polarization. Employing symmetry operations, first-principles methodologies, and Monte Carlo simulations, our investigation delves into the structural, magnetic, ferroelectric, and electronic attributes of the polar LaFeMnNiO$_6$ and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds. The structural analysis uncovers that the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is intricately linked to the Fe/Ti-displacement of square planar Fe/TiO$_4$. Notably, the magnetic LaFeMnNiO$_6$ and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds demonstrate robust ferroelectric polarizations, measuring 20.0 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and 21.8 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, respectively, accompanied by minimalist forbidden energy gaps of 1.40 eV and 1.18 eV using the GGA+U method. Furthermore, we pinpoint elevated magnetic transition temperatures for these compounds. Additionally, our study scrutinizes the energies associated with diverse spin configurations and identifies potential minimum decomposition pathways into stable oxides. This comprehensive analysis ensures the meticulous formation of the LaFeMnNiO$_6$ and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Bond Dipole Theory of Band Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the band offset between materials is pivotal for electronic device functionality. While traditional theories attribute this offset solely to intrinsic properties of constituent materials, interfacial chemistry introduces complexities, including charge transfer dipoles. We address this challenge by defining a reference system based on Wigner-Seitz atoms, which is a charge partitioning that tessellates space while retaining bulk crystal symmetry. The interfacial dipole is then expressed entirely by localized dipoles along interfacial bonds. Geometric analysis reveals that for isotropic materials, both bulk and interfacial contributions to the band offset are orientation independent. This finding is confirmed through first-principles calculations and analysis of 28 distinct interfaces, which show very little (&lt; 0.1 eV) dependence on orientation. Furthermore, the direction dependence of anisotropic materials is well captured by the theory. This work provides crucial insights into the geometric underpinnings of band offset, offering a comprehensive understanding essential for advancing materials design in electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Orthorhombic metal carbide-borides MeC$_2$B$_{12}$ (Me=Mg, Ca, Sr) from first principles: structure, stability and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First principle DFT simulations are employed to study structural and mechanical properties of orthorhombic B12-based metal carbide-borides. The simulations predict the existence of Ca- and Sr- based phases with the structure similar to that of experimentally observed earlier compound MeC$_2$B$_{12}$. Dynamical stability of both phases is demonstrated, and the phase MeC$_2$B$_{12}$ is found to be thermodynamically stable. According to simulations, Ca- and Sr- based phases have significantly enhanced mechanical characteristics, which suggest their potential application as superhard materials. Calculated shear and Young moduli of these phases are nearly 250 and 540 GPa, respectively, and estimated Vickers hardness is 45-55 GPa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11361v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a tight-binding model for the electron system, we investigate the transfer of energy, momentum, and angular momentum mediated by electromagnetic fields among buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and graphene nano-strips. Our nonequilibrium Green's function approach enables calculations away from local thermal equilibrium where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem breaks down. For example, the forces between C$_{60}$ and current-carrying nano-strips are predicted. It is found that the presence of current usually enhances the van der Waals attractive forces. For two current-carrying graphene strips rotated at some angle, the fluctuational force and torque are much stronger at the nanoscale compared to that of the static Biot-Savart law.</description>

      <title>The magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ and its relation to current-induced magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of magnetization using electric fields has been extensively studied in magnetoelectric multiferroic insulator materials. Changes in magnetization in bulk metals caused by electric currents have attracted less attention. The recently discovered metallic magnet Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ has been reported to exhibit current-induced magnetization. Here we determined the magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ using neutron diffraction, aiming to understand the microscopic origin of this magnetoelectric phenomenon in a metal. We established that the antiferromagnetic order emerging below $T_N=5$ K is a cycloid order described by $P6_3/mcm.1'(0,0,g)00sss$ with small moment sizes of $0.50(2)~\mu_B$ and propagation vector ${\bf k}=(0,0,0.386)$. Surprisingly, the symmetry of this magnetic structure is inconsistent with the presence of current-induced magnetization and potential origins of this inconsistency with previous results are discussed. Additionally, our results suggest that moments order along their hard magnetic direction in Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$, a phenomenon which has been observed in other Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Extreme anti-ohmic conductance enhancement in neutral diradical acene-like molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We achieve, at room temperature, conductance enhancements over two orders of magnitude in single molecule circuits formed with polycyclic benzoquinoidal (BQn) diradicals upon increasing molecular length by ~0.5 nm. We find that this extreme and atypical anti-ohmic conductance enhancement at longer molecular lengths is due to the diradical character of the molecules, which can be described as a topologically non-trivial electronic state. We adapt the 1D-SSH model originally developed to examine electronic topological order in linear carbon chains to the polycyclic systems studied here and find that it captures the anti-ohmic trends in this molecular series. The mechanism of conductance enhancement with length is revealed to be constructive quantum interference (CQI) between the frontier orbitals with non-trivial topology, which is present in acene-like, but not in linear, molecular systems. Importantly, we predict computationally and measure experimentally that anti-ohmic trends can be engineered through synthetic adjustments of the diradical character of the acene-like molecules. Overall, we achieve an experimentally unprecedented anti-ohmic enhancement and mechanistic insight into electronic transport in a class of materials that we identify here as promising candidates for creating highly conductive and tunable nanoscale wires.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of the New Medium-Entropy Alloy V4Ti2W with a Body-Centered Cubic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium- and high-entropy alloy (MEA and HEA) superconductors have attracted considerable interest since their discovery. This paper reports the superconducting properties of ternary tungsten-containing MEA V4Ti2W for the first time. V4Ti2W is a type II superconductor with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. Experimental results of resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity indicate that the superconducting transition temperature of the MEA V4Ti2W is roughly 5.0 K. The critical magnetic fields at the upper and lower ends are 9.93(2) T and 40.7(3) mT, respectively. Interestingly, few BCC MEA superconductors with VEC greater than 4.8 have been found. The addition of tungsten leads to a VEC of 4.83 e/a for V4Ti2W, which is rarely higher than the 4.8 value. Adding tungsten element expands the variety of MEA alloys, which may improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials and even superconducting properties. This material could potentially offer a new platform for the investigation of innovative MEA and HEA superconductors.</description>

      <title>Imprinting of Antiferromagnetic Vortex States in NiO-Fe Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic vortices are topological spin structures frequently found in ferromagnets, yet novel to antiferromagnets. By combining experiment and theory, we demonstrate that in a nanostructured antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic NiO(111)-Fe(110) bilayer, a magnetic vortex is naturally stabilized by magnetostatic interactions in the ferromagnet and is imprinted onto the adjacent antiferromagnet via interface exchange coupling. We use micromagnetic simulations to construct a corresponding phase diagram of the stability of the imprinted antiferromagnetic vortex state. Our in depth analysis reveals that the interplay between interface exchange coupling and the antiferromagnet magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role in locally reorienting the N\'eel vector out-of-plane in the prototypical in-plane antiferromagnet NiO and thereby stabilizing the vortices in the antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Direct Exchange Interaction Mediating Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Weakly-Coupled Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic interaction between an optically active singlet state ($S_1S_0$) and a dark state of singlet multiplicity, known as correlated triplet pair ($^1[TT]$), plays a crucial role in the effective transformation from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$ during intramolecular singlet fission (iSF). This process is understood through mechanisms such as direct exchange coupling and incoherent processes that involve super-exchange coupling through charge-transfer states. However, most insights into these mechanisms are derived from theoretical studies due to the difficulties in obtaining experimental evidence. In this study, we investigate the excited-state interactions between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ in spiro-conjugated iSF sensitizers by employing transient two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. This approach allows us to focus on the early stages of the conversion from $S_1S_0$ to $^1[TT]$. Upon optical excitation, a superposition of $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$ is created, which gradually transitions to favor $^1[TT]$ within the characteristic time frames of iSF. The observed high-order signals indicate circular repopulation dynamic that effectively reinitiates the iSF process from higher energy electronic states. Our findings, supported by semi-quantum-mechanical simulations of the experimental data, suggest the presence of a direct iSF mechanism in the dimers, facilitated by weak non-adiabatic coupling between $S_1S_0$ and $^1[TT]$. This experiment provides new insights into the equilibrium between the two electronic states, a phenomenon previously understood primarily through theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced instability of a Weyl nodal loop semimetal towards a diffusive topological metal with protected multifractal surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop, disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions. Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface states starts decreasing. In the strong disordered regime we predict that some types of disorder induce an Anderson transition into an electrically-polarized insulator whose signature may be detected experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Guided wave dispersion is commonly assessed by Fourier analysis of the field along a line, resulting in frequency-wavenumber dispersion curves. In anisotropic plates, a point source can generate multiple dispersion branches pertaining to the same modal surface, which arise due to the angle between the power flux and the wave vector. We show that this phenomenon is particularly pronounced near zero-group-velocity points, entailing up to six contributions along a given direction. Stationary phase points accurately describe the measurements conducted on a monocrystalline silicon plate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted much attention due to the famous, widely adopted interpretation in terms of the Berry curvature dipole in momentum space. Using \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equations, we find a 60\% enhancement in the nonlinear Hall effect of $n$-doped GeTe and its noticeable frequency dependence, qualitatively different from the predictions based on the Berry curvature dipole. The origin of these differences is long-lived valley polarization in the electron distribution arising from electron-phonon scattering. Our findings await immediate experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum transfer from swift electrons to non-spherical nanoparticles within the dipolar approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the angular momentum transfer from a single swift electron to non-spherical metallic nanoparticles, specifically investigating spheroidal and polyhedral (Platonic Solids) shapes. While previous research has predominantly focused on spherical nanoparticles, our work expands the knowledge by exploring various geometries. Employing classical electrodynamics and the small particle limit, we calculate the angular momentum transfer by integrating the spectral density, ensuring causality through Fourier-transform analysis. Our findings demonstrate that prolate spheroidal nanoparticles exhibit a single blueshifted plasmonic resonance, compared to spherical nanoparticles of equivalent volume, resulting in lower angular momentum transfer. Conversely, oblate nanoparticles display two resonances (one blueshifted and one redshifted) resulting in a higher angular momentum transfer than their spherical counterparts. Additionally, Platonic Solids with fewer faces exhibit significant redshifts in plasmonic resonances, leading to higher angular momentum transfer due to edge effects. We also observe resonances and angular momentum transfers with similar characteristics in specific pairs of Platonic Solids, known as duals. These results highlight promising applications, particularly in electron tweezers technology.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a new machine learned interatomic potential for the prototypical austenitic steel Fe$_{7}$Cr$_{2}$Ni, using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. This new GAP can model the alloy's properties with close to density functional theory (DFT) accuracy, while at the same time allowing us to access larger length and time scales than expensive first-principles methods. We also extended the GAP input descriptors to approximate the effects of collinear spins (Spin GAP), and demonstrate how this extended model successfully predicts structural distortions due to antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic spin states. We demonstrate the application of the Spin GAP model for bulk properties and vacancies and validate against DFT. These results are a step towards modelling the atomistic origins of ageing in austenitic steels with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling microstructural damage for leakage current degradation in SiC Schottky diode after heavy ions irradiation under 200 V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-event burnout and single-event leakage current (SELC) in SiC power devices induced by heavy ions severely limit their space application, and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. One fundamental problem is lack of high-resolution characterization of radiation damage in the irradiated SiC power devices, which is a crucial indicator of the related mechanism. In this letter, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the radiation damage in the 1437.6 MeV 181Ta-irradiated SiC junction barrier Schottky diode under 200 V. The amorphous radiation damage with about 52 nm in diameter and 121 nm in length at the Schottky metal (Ti)-semiconductor (SiC) interface was observed. More importantly, in the damage site the atomic mixing of Ti, Si, and C was identified by electron energy loss spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM. It indicates that the melting of the Ti-SiC interface induced by localized Joule heating is responsible for the amorphization and the formation of titanium silicide, titanium carbide, or ternary phases. These modifications at nanoscale in turn cause the localized degradation of the Schottky contact, resulting in the permanent increase in leakage current. This experimental study provides very valuable clues to thorough understanding of the SELC mechanism in SiC diode.</description>

      <title>Approaching Periodic Systems in Ensemble Density Functional Theory via Finite One-Dimensional Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional ``particle in a box'' systems, which approach the uniform electron gas (UEG). Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a correction to the effective mass, with results from tri-ensembles similar to literature on 2D and 3D UEGs, indicating promise for non-trivial results from EDFT on periodic systems. Singlet excitation energies are found to be positive, but triplet excitation energies are sometimes negative (a triplet instability), pointing to deficiencies of the approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of MXenes by three bands tight-binding model of \d_{z^2} , \d_{xy} , and \d_{x^2-y^2} orbitals. The three corresponding bands touch each other at high symmetry K point in the case of absence of spin-orbit interaction. The proper parameters can be obtained by Slater-Koster parameters related to chemical bonding, \pi, \sigma, and \delta bonds. The model calculated for these band structures make an agreement with the same trend as discussed in DFT calculation which the hopping parameters may be identified roughly by fermi velocity. Furthermore, the triplet fermion occurs around K point hosting by flat band, leading to super-Klein tunnelling and anti-super-Klein tunnelling for gapped and gapless pseudospin-1 fermion, respectively. These may apply for nanodevices operated by spin polarization which is more stable than that of the conventional two-dimensional materials.</description>

As the field matures, new data and models created by different groups become available, opening possibilities for cooperative modeling. However, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they forget how to perform an old task when trained on a new one. This hinders cooperation because adapting an existing model for a new task affects the performance on a previous task trained by someone else. The authors developed a continual learning method that addresses this issue, applying it here for the first time to solid mechanics. In particular, the method is applied to recurrent neural networks to predict history-dependent plasticity behavior, although it can be used on any other architecture (feedforward, convolutional, etc.) and to predict other phenomena. This work intends to spawn future developments on continual learning that will foster cooperative strategies among the mechanics community to solve increasingly challenging problems. We show that the chosen continual learning strategy can sequentially learn several constitutive laws without forgetting them, using less data to achieve the same error as standard (non-cooperative) training of one law per model.</description>

      <title>Cornertronics in Two-Dimensional Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional electronic devices rely on electron's intrinsic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) to process information. However, additional d.o.f. like the valley, can emerge in the low-energy states of certain systems. Here, we show that the quantum dots (QDs) constructed from two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulator (SOTI) posses a new kind of d.o.f., namely corner freedom, related to the topological corner states that reside at different corners of the systems. Since the corner states are well separated in real space, they can be intuitively addressed and manipulated individually, giving rise to the concept of cornertronics. Via symmetry analysis and material search, we identify the TiSiCO-family monolayers as the first prototype of cornertronics materials, where the corner states can be controlled by both electric and optical fields, due to the novel corner-layer coupling (CLC) effect and the corner-contrasted optical selection rules. Furthermore, we find that the band gap of the TiSiCO nanodisk lies in the terahertz region and is robust to size reduction. These results indicate that the TiSiCO nanodisks can be used to design terahertz devices with ultrasmall size, electric-field tunable band gap, and the ability to simultaneously detect the strength and polarization of terahertz waves, which is not possible for previously reported QDs. Our findings not only pave the way for the cornertronics, but also open a new direction for the research in 2D SOTI, QD and terahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and exceptional points (EPs) are unique singularities of non-Hermitian systems. BICs demonstrate enhancement of the electromagnetic field at the nanoscale, while EPs exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that several BICs can be merged into one EP, forming an EP-BIC. The resulting state inherits properties from both BICs and EP, namely, it does not radiate and shows extremely high sensitivity to perturbations. We validate the developed theory with numerical simulations and demonstrate the formation of second and third-order EP-BICs in stacked dielectric metasurfaces. We also show that the losses of the resulting leaky resonances exhibit an anomalous behavior when the unit cell is broken, which differs from the asymptotics commonly attributed to BICs.</description>

      <title>Transformable Super-Isostatic Crystals Self-Assembled from Segment Colloidal Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles can spontaneously self-assemble into ordered structures, which not only can manipulate the propagation of light, but also vibration or phonons. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study the self-assembly of perfectly aligned segment rod particles with lateral flat cutting. Under the help of surface attractions, we find that particles with different cutting degree can self-assemble into different crystal phases characterized by bond coordination z that varies from 3 to 6. Importantly, we identify a transformable super-isostatic structures with pgg symmetry and redundant bonds (z=5). We find that this structure can support either the soft bulk model or soft edge model depending on its Poisson's ratio which can be tuned from positive to negative by a uniform soft deformation. Importantly, the bulk soft modes are associated with states of self-stress along the direction of zero strain during the uniform soft deformation. This self-assembled transformable super-isostatic structure may act as mechanical metamaterials with potential application in micro-mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>Induced quantum magnetism in CEF singlet ground state models: Thermodynamics and excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative investigation of singlet ground state induced magnetism for singlet, doublet and triplet excited CEF states of non-Kramers f-electrons relevant primarily for Pr- and U- based compounds. This type of magnetic order is of intrinsic quantum nature because it requires the superposition of singlet ground state with excited states due to non-diagonal matrix elements of the effective intersite exchange to generate local moments. In contrast to conventional magnets the local moments and their ordering appear simultaneously at the transition temperature. It is finite only if the control parameter proportional to the ratio of exchange strength to level splitting exceeds a critical value marking the quantum critical point of the models. We determine the dependence of transition temperature, saturation moment, renormalised level splitting, specific heat jumps and low-temperature susceptibility as function of control parameter. Furthermore the temperature dependence of these quantities is calculated for control parameters above and below the quantum critical point and the distinction to conventional magnetism is discussed. In addition we investigate the dynamical properties of the three models, deriving the magnetic exciton dispersion and their critical behaviour. In particular the conditions for true and arrested soft-mode behaviour at the ordering wave vector are identified.</description>

      <title>State-Specific Coupled-Cluster Methods for Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine $\Delta$CCSD, a state-specific coupled-cluster (CC) with single and double excitations (CCSD) approach that targets excited states through the utilization of non-Aufbau determinants. This methodology is particularly efficient when dealing with doubly excited states, a domain where the standard equation-of-motion CCSD (EOM-CCSD) formalism falls short. Our goal here is to evaluate the effectiveness of $\Delta$CCSD when applied to other types of excited states, comparing its consistency and accuracy with EOM-CCSD. To this end, we report a benchmark on excitation energies computed with the $\Delta$CCSD and EOM-CCSD methods, for a set of molecular excited-state energies that encompasses not only doubly excited states but also doublet-doublet transitions and (singlet and triplet) singly-excited states of closed-shell systems. In the latter case, we rely on a minimalist version of multireference CC known as the two-determinant CCSD method to compute the excited states. Our dataset, consisting of 276 excited states stemming from the \textsc{quest} database [V\'eril \textit{et al.}, \textit{WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci.} \textbf{2021}, 11, e1517], provides a significant base to draw general conclusions concerning the accuracy of $\Delta$CCSD. Except for the doubly-excited states, we found that $\Delta$CCSD underperforms EOM-CCSD. For doublet-doublet transitions, the difference between the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the two methodologies (of \SI{0.10}{\eV} and \SI{0.07}{\eV}) is less pronounced than that obtained for singly-excited states of closed-shell systems (MAEs of \SI{0.15}{\eV} and \SI{0.08}{\eV}). This discrepancy is largely attributed to a greater number of excited states in the latter set exhibiting multiconfigurational characters, which are more challenging for $\Delta$CCSD.</description>

      <title>Investigation of low band gap silicon alloy thin film solar cell for improving short and long wavelength response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of a solar cell can provide various information that can be useful to maximize its power conversion efficiency (PCE). In that respect we carried out a set of numerical simulation using AFORS-HET simulation program. Separately, in order to get a better understanding, the optical absorption in individual layers devices were analyzed. Current-voltage characteristic curve of a reference cell (Cell-A) was used as the starting device. The PCE of the reference device was $8.85\%$ with short circuit current density $J_{sc}$ of 15.43 mA/cm$^{2}$ and fill factor (FF) of $68.3\%$. However, it was noticed that the reference cell had high parasitic optical absorption at the window layer and the device structure was also not optimized. After suitable optimization the PCE of this device (Cell-B2) improves to $11.59\%$ ($J_{sc}$ and FF of 13.0 mA/cm$^{2}$ and $87\%$ respectively). The results show that the effective optical absorption in the active layer can be improved significantly by optimizing the device structure. The short wavelength response can be improved by reducing the parasitic optical absorption by the doped window layer, while its long wavelength response improves by raising effective absorption length of the active layer. Furthermore, its optimum thickness, for the highest possible PCE, is found to be dependent upon the material properties, more importantly on its defect density.</description>
