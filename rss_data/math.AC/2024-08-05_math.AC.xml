      <title>Multiplicative Lattices with Absorbing Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [22], Yassine et al. introduced the notion of 1-absorbing prime ideals in commutative rings with nonzero identity. In this article, we examine the concept of 1-absorbing prime elements in C-lattices. We investigate the C-lattices in which every element is a finite product of 1-absorbing prime elements (we denote them as OAFLs for short). Moreover, we study C-lattices having 2-absorbing factorization (we denote them as TAFLs for short).</description>

      <title>Two Generalizations of Hopfian Abelian Groupa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper targets to generalize the notion of Hopfian groups in the commutative case by defining the so-called {\bf relatively Hopfian groups} and {\bf weakly Hopfian groups}, and establishing some their crucial properties and characterizations. Specifically, we prove that for a reduced Abelian $p$-group $G$ such that $p^{\omega}G$ is Hopfian (in particular, is finite), the notions of relative Hopficity and ordinary Hopficity do coincide. We also show that if $G$ is a reduced Abelian $p$-group such that $p^{\omega}G$ is bounded and $G/p^{\omega}G$ is Hopfian, then $G$ is relatively Hopfian. This allows us to construct a reduced relatively Hopfian Abelian $p$-group $G$ with $p^{\omega}G$ an infinite elementary group such that $G$ is {\bf not} Hopfian. In contrast, for reduced torsion-free groups, we establish that the relative and ordinary Hopficity are equivalent. Moreover, the mixed case is explored as well, showing that the structure of both relatively and weakly Hopfian groups can be quite complicated.</description>

      <title>On the two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture: Magnus' formula revisited, IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(F,G)$ be a Jacobian pair with $d=w\text{-deg}(F)$ and $e=w\text{-deg}(G)$ for some direction $w$. A generalized Magnus' formula approximates $G$ as $\sum_{\gamma\ge 0} c_\gamma F^{\frac{e-\gamma}{d}}$ for some complex numbers $c_\gamma$. We develop an approach to the two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture, aiming to minimize the use of terms corresponding to $\gamma&gt;0$. As an initial step in this approach, we define and study the inner polynomials of $F$ and $G$. The main result of this paper shows that the northeastern vertex of the Newton polygon of each inner polynomial is located within a specific region. As applications of this result, we introduce several conjectures and prove some of them for special cases.</description>

      <title>A ring of cohomological operators on Ext and Tor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any homomorphism of commutative rings $A \to B$ and a $B$-module $M$, we construct a structure of graded $\mathrm{S}_B^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^1(A,B,B)$-module on $\mathrm{Ext}_B^{\ast}(M,M)$ and $\mathrm{Tor}_{\ast}^B(M,M)$, where $\mathrm{H}^1(A,B,B)$ is the first Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology module and $\mathrm{S}^{\ast}$ denotes the symmetric algebra. This structure generalizes the well known structures of $B[X_1, \dots, X_n]$-module constructed by Gulliksen when $B=R/I$ and $I$ is generated by a regular sequence of length $n$ (in this case, $\mathrm{S}_B^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^1(R,B,B)= \mathrm{S}_B^{\ast} \left(\widehat{I/I^2}\right)=B[X_1, \dots, X_n]$), but the main interest is that for any such $B=R/I$, Gulliksen operations factorize through the ring $\mathrm{S}_B^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^1(A,B,B)$ for any ring $A$ such that $R$ is an $A$-algebra, allowing us to think that, for some purposes, in order to define these cohomological operations, Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology is a more natural choice than the normal module $\widehat{I/I^2}$.</description>

      <title>Valuative invariants for large classes of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04893v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an operation in matroid theory that allows one to transition a given matroid into another with more bases via relaxing a \emph{stressed subset}. This framework provides a new combinatorial characterization of the class of split matroids. Moreover, it permits to describe an explicit matroid subdivision of a hypersimplex, which in turn can be used to write down concrete formulas for the evaluations of any valuative invariant on these matroids. This shows that evaluations on split matroids depend solely on the behavior of the invariant on tractable subclass of Schubert matroids. We address systematically the consequences of our approach for several invariants. They include the volume and Ehrhart polynomial of base polytopes, the Tutte polynomial, Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, the Whitney numbers of the first and second kind, spectrum polynomials and a generalization of these by Denham, chain polynomials and Speyer's $g$-polynomials, as well as Chow rings of matroids and their Hilbert--Poincar\'e series. The flexibility of this setting allows us to give a unified explanation for several recent results regarding the listed invariants; furthermore, we emphasize it as a powerful computational tool to produce explicit data and concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Moment varieties from inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on moment varieties for Gaussian distributions and their mixtures, we study moment varieties for two other statistically important two-parameter distributions: the inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions. In particular, we realize the moment varieties as determinantal varieties and find their degrees and singularities. We also provide computational evidence for algebraic identifiability of mixtures, and study the identifiability degree and Euclidean distance degree.</description>
