      <title>Enhancing Research Information Systems with Identification of Domain Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research organisations and their research outputs have been growing considerably in the past decades. This large body of knowledge attracts various stakeholders, e.g., for knowledge sharing, technology transfer, or potential collaborations. However, due to the large amount of complex knowledge created, traditional methods of manually curating catalogues are often out of time, imprecise, and cumbersome. Finding domain experts and knowledge within any larger organisation, scientific and also industrial, has thus become a serious challenge. Hence, exploring an institutions domain knowledge and finding its experts can only be solved by an automated solution. This work presents the scheme of an automated approach for identifying scholarly experts based on their publications and, prospectively, their teaching materials. Based on a search engine, this approach is currently being implemented for two universities, for which some examples are presented. The proposed system will be helpful for finding peer researchers as well as starting points for knowledge exploitation and technology transfer. As the system is designed in a scalable manner, it can easily include additional institutions and hence provide a broader coverage of research facilities in the future.</description>

      <title>New fractional classifications of papers based on two generations of references and on the ASJC Scopus scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates a set of methods to classify individual Scopus publications using their references back to the second generation, where each publication can be assigned fractionally into up to five ASJC (All Science Journal Classifications) categories, excluding the Multidisciplinary area and the miscellaneous categories. Based on proposals by Glanzel et al. (1999a, 1999b, 2021), some additional parameters are established that allow different results to be obtained depending on how category membership is weighted or how the acceptance thresholds for multiple assignments are established. Various classifications are obtained, and then compared with each other, with the original ASJC Scopus journal classification, and with the AAC (Authors Assignation Collection) classification of a previous study (Alvarez-Llorente et al., 2023) in which the papers corresponding authors assign them the most appropriate categories. Classifications in which a high threshold is set for allowing assignments to multiple categories, combined with the use of first- and second-generation references and averaging over the number of references, provide the most promising results, improving over other reference-based reclassification proposals in terms of granularity, and over the Scopus classification itself in such aspects as the homogeneity of the publications assigned to a category. They also show greater coincidence with the AAC classification.</description>
