      <title>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Consistent truncations and G$_2$-invariant AdS$_4$ solutions of $D=11$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal supergravities in ten and eleven dimensions admit consistent truncations on particular spheres to maximal supergravities in lower dimensions. Concurrently, the truncation to singlets under any subgroup of the sphere isometry group leads to consistent truncations with less or no supersymmetry. We review the relation between these truncations in the framework of exceptional field theory. As an application, we derive three new G$_2$-invariant solutions of $D=11$ supergravity. Their geometry is of the form AdS$_4\times \Sigma_7$ where $\Sigma_7$ is a deformed seven-sphere, preserving SO(7) isometries.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Extremal Scalar Amplitudes With and Without Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine positivity bounds on the $2\to2$ scattering of identical massless real scalars with a novel perspective on how these bounds can be used to constrain the spectrum of UV theories. We propose that the entire space of consistent weakly-coupled (and generically non-supersymmetric) UV amplitudes is determined as a convex hull of the massive scalar amplitude and a one-parameter family of scalarless "extremal amplitudes" parameterized by the ratio of the masses of the two lightest massive states. Further, we propose that the extremal amplitudes can be constructed from a similar one-parameter set of maximally supersymmetric amplitudes, leading to the surprising possibility that the S-matrix bootstrap with maximal supersymmetry may be sufficient to determine the entire allowed space of four-point amplitudes! Finally, we show that minimal spectrum input reduces the allowed space of Wilson coefficients to small islands around the open string Dirac-Born-Infeld tree amplitude and the closed string Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude.</description>

      <title>Strings from Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills preserving half the supersymmetry, we manifestly recast the gauge theory Feynman diagram expansion as a sum over dual closed strings. Each individual Feynman diagram maps on to a Riemann surface with specific moduli. The Feynman diagrams thus correspond to discrete lattice points on string moduli space, rather than discretized worldsheets. This picture is valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion. Concretely, the mapping is carried out at the level of a two-matrix integral with its dual string description. It provides a microscopic picture of open/closed string duality for this topological subsector of the full AdS/CFT correspondence. At the same time, the concrete mechanism for how strings emerge from the matrix model Feynman diagrams predicts that multiple open string descriptions can exist for the same dual closed string theory. By considering the insertion of determinant operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, we indeed find six equivalent open-string descriptions. Each of them generates Feynman diagrams related to one another via (partial) graph duality, and hence encodes the same information. The embedding of these Kontsevich-like duals into the 1/2 SUSY sector of AdS/CFT is achieved by open strings on giant graviton branes.</description>

      <title>(Anti-)Stokes Scattering on the Domain Wall String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a general (2+1)-dimensional scalar model, we consider the scattering of a single quantum of radiation off a domain wall string, which excites or de-excites the wall's internal shape mode. We refer to these two process as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. We calculate the probability densities for these processes to first order in quantum field theory, as a function of incoming momenta and angles. We include both the case in which the incident particle is transmitted and also that in which it bounces backward. Our results are given as finite-dimensional integrals of normal modes and elementary functions, and numerical results are presented in the particular case of the $\phi^4$ double-well model.</description>

      <title>Luminal Scalar-Tensor theories for a not so dark Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general the speed of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. Nevertheless, it has been measured that their speeds are nearly the same. For the most general Scalar-Tensor theories classified to date that do propagate a graviton -- DHOST, including Horndeski and Beyond Horndeski (BH) theories -- we show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. There is at least a Luminal BH theory for which the GW decay into DE is suppressed in any cosmological background.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{SW}$-algebras and strings with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between super $\mathcal{W}$-algebras ($\mathcal{SW}$-algebras) and $\mathrm{G}$-structures with torsion. The former are realised as symmetry algebras of strings with $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetry on the worldsheet, while the latter are associated with generic string backgrounds with non-trivial Neveu-Schwarz flux $H$. In particular, we focus on manifolds featuring $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$, $\mathrm{G}_2$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structures. We compare the full quantum algebras with their classical limits, obtained by studying the commutators of superconformal and $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry transformations, which preserve the action of the $(1,0)$ non-linear $\sigma$-model. We show that, at first order in the string length scale $\ell_s$, the torsion deforms some of the OPE coefficients corresponding to special holonomy through a scalar torsion class.</description>

      <title>Classification of Narain CFTs and Ensemble Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic classification of Narain conformal field theories based on finite dimensional Lie algebras $\mathbf{g}$ and representations $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{g}}$. First, we describe our proposal for the su(2) conformal theory termed as NCFT$_{2}^{\mathbf{su}_{2}}$ with central charge $(\mathrm{c}_{L},\mathrm{c}_{R})=(\mathrm{1},\mathrm{1})$ and modular invariant partition function Z$_{\mathbf{su}_{2}}^{(1,1)}$. Then, we extend this model to encompass the NCFT$_{2}^{\mathbf{g}}$ families with higher rank algebras $\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{r}} $ having central charges $\mathrm{c}_{L/R}=\mathrm{r}$ and partition function Z$_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)}.$ In this newly established framework, we construct a realisation of the Zamolodchikov metric of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\mathbf{g}}$ in terms of Lie algebraic data namely the Cartan matrix K$_{\mathbf{g}}$ and its inverse K$_{\mathbf{g}}^{-1}$. Properties regarding the ensemble averaging of these CFTs and their holographic dual are also derived. Additionally, we discuss possible generalisations to NCFTs having dis-symmetric central charges $(\mathrm{c}_{L},\mathrm{c}_{R})=(\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{r})$ with $s&gt;r$ and highlight further features of the partition function Z$_{\mathbf{g}}^{(r,r)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension depenent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states.</description>

      <title>Marginal deformations of SU(2)$_k$ WZW model boundary states in open string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to describe moduli space of boundary states in the SU(2)$_k$ WZW model by marginally deformed solutions in open string field theory in the level truncation approximation. In contrast with other solutions for marginal deformations, we construct solutions with $g$-function different from the background (typically lower), so our approach essentially combines marginal and relevant deformations. After partially fixing an SU(2) symmetry of the equations of motion, we find families of solutions parameterized by the coefficient of the marginal field given by the $J^3$ current and we are able to identify them as Cardy boundary states with varying angle $\theta$. However, it turns out that these solutions are inconsistent if the marginal parameter is higher than a certain value, which means that they cover only a part of the moduli space. We also compare the relation between the marginal parameter and the angle $\theta$ for different solutions and we find evidence suggesting that this relation is universal for certain classes of solutions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Photon and Dilepton Yield in a Thermalized Quark-Gluon Plasma under Magnetic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the effects of stochastic magnetic fluctuations with respect to an intense magnetic field background over the yields for photon and dilepton emission processes in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma phase. Such stochastic fluctuations model the effects of nearly random initial conditions for the nuclei participating in non-central heavy-ion collisions, which are the sources of the background magnetic field. Our theoretical results predict significant anisotropic effects due to stochastic magnetic noise over the angular distribution for photon and dilepton production rates in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections in M-theory from precision numerical bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study higher-derivative corrections to the graviton scattering amplitude in M-theory, via the stress tensor correlator of 3d $\mathcal{N} =8$ $\text{U}(N)_k\times \text{U}(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory (dual to graviton scattering in M-theory on $\text{AdS}_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$). We use the conformal bootstrap combined with an integral constraint derived from supersymmetric localization in order to constrain semishort OPE coefficients appearing in the stress tensor correlator. We obtain islands that are significantly more precise than those in previous studies that did not use the integral constraint. Using these islands, we can estimate the powers and coefficients in a large central charge expansion. This allows us to accurately read off the N$^3$LO contribution, from the protected $D^6 R^4$ correction, and also estimate the N$^4$LO contribution, from the unprotected $D^8 R^4$ correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the Einstein-Hilbert truncation for the running action in (euclidean) quantum gravity, we derive the renormalization group equations for the cosmological and Newton constant. We find that these equations admit only the Gaussian fixed point with a UV-attractive and a UV-repulsive eigendirection, and that there is no sign of the non-trivial UV-attractive fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario. Crucial to our analysis is a careful treatment of the measure in the path integral that defines the running action and a proper introduction of the physical running scale $k$. We also show why and how in usual implementations of the RG equations the aforementioned UV-attractive fixed point is generated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deflection of light rays in a cold, non-magnetized plasma using the worldline framework. Starting from Synge's Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a position-space action and use it perturbatively to calculate light bending angles. In the homogeneous case, the action reduces to that of a massive particle, allowing us to extract the bending angle of light in the presence of the medium using a well-known analogy. For the inhomogeneous case, we consider a power law model and construct Feynman rules in time to compute the purely plasma-induced corrections to the bending angle at Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a purely gravitational origin of observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance from asymmetric Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes (PBH) in presence of a non-zero chemical potential, originating from the space-time curvature. Considering the PBHs are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated Universe, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the parameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the quantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler Potential and QNMs in Quantum Corrected AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles in the spacetime surrounding a static, spherically symmetric black hole, which is described by an AdS-Schwarzschild-like metric and incorporates a quantum correction. This black hole also features phantom global monopoles, which modify the structure of the black hole space-time. We begin by deriving the effective potential governing the motion of test particles in this system and carefully analyze the impact of quantum correction in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Furthermore, we extend our study to include the spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler (RW) potential, which characterizes the dynamics of perturbations in this quantum-corrected black hole background. By examining this RW potential for various spin fields, we show how quantum corrections affect its form in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Our analysis demonstrate that quantum correction significantly alter the nature of the RW-potential, influencing the stability, and behavior of test particles and perturbations around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal phase structure of the Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase (BMN) matrix model using non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo calculations. Our main analyses span three orders of magnitude in the coupling, involving systems with sizes up to $N_{\tau} = 24$ lattice sites and SU($N$) gauge groups with $8 \leq N \leq 16$. In addition, we carry out extended checks of discretization artifacts for $N_{\tau} \leq 128$ and gauge group SU(4). We find results for the deconfinement temperature that interpolate between the perturbative prediction at weak coupling and the large-$N$ dual supergravity calculation at strong coupling. While we confirm that the phase transition is first order for strong coupling, it appears to be continuous for weaker couplings.</description>

      <title>Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Shadow and other Observables away from the Horizon: Extending the Effective Metric Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work we have developed a model-independent, effective description of quantum deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The deformations of the metric are captured by two functions of the physical distance to the horizon, which are provided in the form of self-consistent Taylor series expansions. While this approach efficiently captures physical observables in the immediate vicinity of the horizon, it is expected to encounter problems of convergence at further distances. Therefore, we demonstrate in this paper how to use Pad\'e approximants to extend the range of applicability of this framework. We provide explicit approximations of physical observables that depend on finitely many effective parameters of the deformed black hole geometry, depending on the order of the Pad\'e approximant. By taking the asymptotic limit of this order, we in particular provide a closed-form expression for the black hole shadow of the (fully) deformed geometry, which captures the leading quantum corrections. We illustrate our results for a number of quantum black holes previously proposed in the literature and find that our effective approach provides excellent approximations in all cases.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential.</description>

In this talk we present an extension of our recent determination of the sphaleron rate, in the SU(3) gauge theory, based on the determination of the two-point function of the topological charge density at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Black holes and their shadows in $F(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radii of the photon sphere and the black hole shadow in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity. For this purpose, we derive the field equation for the corresponding theory when the general spherically symmetric and static configuration is considered. This equation is the third-order differential equation with respect to $F_R(r)\equiv \left. \frac{dF(R)}{dR}\right|_{R=R(r)}$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. Solving the equation, we find $F(R)$ as a function of $r$, $F_R=F_R(r)$. By using the assumed and obtained geometry, one can calculate the scalar curvature $R$ as a function of $r$, $R=R(r)$, which could be solved with respect to $r$ as $r=r(R)$. Then one finds the functional form of $F_R$ as a function of the scalar curvature $R$, $F_R=F_R(R)=F_R\left( r=r\left(R\right)\right)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton contributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from momentum-dependent time-like one-particle-irreducible correlation functions. Specifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral functions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section decreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible with unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We present the first benchmark evaluation of the two-loop finite remainders for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders in the gluon channel. We work in the leading colour approximation, and perform the numerical evaluation in the physical phase space. To achieve this result, we develop a new method for expressing the master integrals in terms of a (over-complete) basis of special functions that enables the infrared and ultraviolet poles to be cancelled analytically despite the presence of elliptic Feynman integrals. The special function basis makes it manifest that the elliptic functions appear solely in the finite remainder, and can be evaluated numerically through generalised series expansions. The helicity amplitudes are constructed using four dimensional projectors combined with finite-field techniques to perform integration-by-parts reduction, mapping to special functions and Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$.</description>

Abstract: We present the first lattice determination of the SUSY $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$. We exploit large-$N$ twisted volume reduction, and present two determinations based on the Banks-Casher relation and on a Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner-like formula, both giving perfectly compatible results. By expressing the lattice results in the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov scheme, we are able for the first time to compare lattice and analytical computations, resolving a 40-year-long debate about the actual value and $N$-dependence of the gluino condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many purposes, classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly well even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical fields, and high frequencies, approaching the Compton frequency. However, the applicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the details of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of plasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum relativistic regimes. Due to the field geometry of study, mechanisms like radiation reaction and Breit-Wheeler pair production, which tend to be important for electromagnetic fields, are rather effectively suppressed. Moreover, we find that the polarization current due to the electron spin is generally negligible for frequencies below the Compton frequency, compared to the free current, whose magnitude is well-approximated by the classical Vlasov theory. However, we show that pair creation due to the Schwinger mechanism can sometimes be important for surprisingly modest field strengths, of the order of 10 % of the critical field or even smaller. A rough guideline for when the classical Vlasov theory can be applied is given</description>

Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Alleviating cosmological tensions with a hybrid dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological model inspired by hybrid inflation, where two scalar fields representing dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interact through a coupling that is proportional to the DE scalar field $1/\phi$. The strength of the coupling is governed solely by the initial condition of the scalar field, $\phi_i$, which parametrises deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this model, the scalar field tracks the behaviour of DM during matter-domination until it transitions to DE while the DM component decays quicker than standard CDM during matter-domination, and is therefore different from some interacting DM-DE models which behaves like phantom dark energy. Using \textit{Planck} 2018 CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and Pantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase in $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. In addition, we find that higher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of $\omega_m$, and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8$, potentially relevant to address the $S_8$ tension. Bayesian model comparison, however, reveals inconclusive results for most datasets, unless S$H_0$ES data are included, in which case a moderate evidence in favour of the hybrid model is found.</description>

      <title>Towards the HEFT-hedron: the complete set of positivity constraints at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the complete set of positivity bounds on the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at next-to-leading order (NLO). We identify the 15 operators that can be constrained by positivity, as they contribute to $s^2$-growth in the amplitude for longitudinal gauge-Higgs scattering, that is to all possible 2-to-2 scattering processes involving longitudinal gauge bosons, $V_L = W_L^\pm, Z_L$, and the Higgs boson, $h$. We find two sets of constraints: (i) specific linear combinations of CP-even Wilson coefficients (WCs) must be positive, and (ii) the magnitudes of some WCs -- including all CP-odd ones -- must be smaller than products of other CP-even WCs. We present our final constraints on the 15 dimensional HEFT space and show how known positivity bounds on the 3 dimensional space of dimension 8 SMEFT can be recovered from them. We find that only about $5\%$ of the parameter space for WCs of HEFT operators at NLO complies with these positivity constraints. Additionally, we obtain double-sided bounds on these WCs by fully exploiting the implications of unitarity and $st$-crossing symmetry. For WCs contributing to the vector boson scattering process our final constraints are in most cases significantly stronger than the experimental ones. For the $V_L V_L, hh \to hh$ and $V_LV_L, hh \to V_Lh$ process, there are no reported experimental limits and our theoretical constraints provide the first bounds.</description>

      <title>On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Late-time Cosmology without Dark Sector but with Closed String Massless Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of solving the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that \textit{the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating}. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector or coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Observables of Quantized Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

Abstract: We compute the one-loop $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude of massless scalars on the world volume of an infinite $D = 11$ supermembrane quantized in the static gauge. The resulting expression is manifestly finite and turns out to be much simpler than in the bosonic membrane case in arXiv:2308.12189 being simply proportional to the tree-level scattering amplitude. We also consider the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$ membrane with one dimension compactified on a circle of radius R and demonstrate how the supermembrane scattering amplitude reduces to the one on an infinite $D = 10$ Green-Schwarz superstring in the limit of R $\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite-distance limits in the moduli space of perturbative string vacua. The remarkable interplay of string dualities seems to determine a highly non-trivial dichotomy, summarized by the emergent string conjecture, by which in some duality frame either internal dimensions decompactify or a unique critical string becomes tensionless. We investigate whether this pattern persists in potentially non-geometric settings, showing that (a proxy for) the cutoff of the gravitational effective field theory in perturbative type II vacua extracted from a graviton scattering amplitude vanishes if and only if a light tower of states appears. Moreover, under some technical assumptions on the spectrum of conformal weights, the cutoff scales with the spectral gap of the internal conformal field theory in the same manner as in decompactification or emergent string limits, regardless of supersymmetry or whether the internal sector is geometric. As a byproduct, we elucidate the role of the species scale in (de)compactifications and show compatibility between effective field theory and worldsheet approaches in geometric settings with curvature.</description>

Additionally, we elucidate the distinctions between four different `operator reconstruction wedges' and demonstrate how to enhance the proof for the absence of global symmetries in geometrical states in AdS/CFT \cite{Harlow:2018jwu, Harlow:2018tng} as an example of these distinctions.</description>

      <title>Non-planar corrections in ABJM theory from quantum M2 branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of semiclassical strings in AdS spacetimes yields predictions for the strong-coupling behaviour of the scaling dimensions of the corresponding operators in the planar limit of the dual gauge theory. Finding non-planar corrections requires computing string loops (corresponding to torus and higher genus surfaces), which is a challenging task. It turns out that in the case of the $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory there is an alternative approach: one may semiclassically quantize M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$. Such M2 branes are the M-theory generalization of the strings in AdS$_4\times $CP$^3$. In this work, we show that by expanding in large M2 brane tension $ T_2 \sim \sqrt{kN} $ for fixed $k$, followed by an expansion in large $k$, we can predict the large $\lambda$ asymptotics of the non-planar corrections to the dimensions of the dual ABJM operators. As a specific example, we consider the M2 brane configuration that generalizes the long folded string with large spin in AdS$_4$, and compute the 1-loop correction to its energy. This calculation allows us to determine non-planar corrections to the universal scaling function or cusp anomalous dimension. We extend our analysis to the semiclassical M2 branes that generalize the "short" and "long" circular strings with two equal angular momenta in CP$^3$. The "short" M2 brane corresponds to a dual operator whose dimension at strong coupling scales as $\Delta \sim \lambda^{1/4} + \dots$, and we derive the leading non-planar correction to it.</description>

Abstract: On-shell methods have found a new application to local observables such as asymptotic radiation fields and gravitational waveforms. While these observables are invariant under small gauge transformations, they are known to depend on a choice of asymptotic gauge; in gravity on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes, this is a choice of BMS frame. In this letter, we provide a method for capturing these supertranslations, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the on-shell framework of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry properties of infinite spin fields in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space which are involved in the Lagrangian model proposed in arXiv:2403.14446 where the main role is played by operator constraints. It is shown that the conditions defining infinite spin states in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$-invariant. It is found that in the model under consideration the Casimir operators are completely fixed by the constraint operators and only one of the Casimir operators is independent. It is shown that in this model, infinite spin fields in $\rm{AdS}_4$ space are described by the most degenerate representations of the $\mathrm{SO}(2,3)$ group.</description>

  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutory $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of capped black holes: large and small bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new non-BPS solution describing an asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric capped black hole in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This solution describes a spherical black hole, while the exterior region of the horizon exhibits a non-trivial topology of $[{\mathbb R}^4 \# {\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^2] \setminus {\mathbb B}^4$ on a timeslice. This solution extends our previously constructed three-parameter solution to a more general four-parameter solution. To derive this solution, we utilize a combination of the Ehlers and Harrison transformations and then impose appropriate boundary conditions on the solution's parameters. It can be shown that the resultant solution is free from curvature, conical, Dirac-Misner string and orbifold singularities, as well as closed timelike curves on and outside the horizon. Characterized by four independent conserved charges -- mass, two angular momenta, and electric charge -- this solution reveals two distinct branches: a small bubble branch and a large bubble branch, distinguished by non-conserved local quantities such as magnetic flux or magnetic potential. This shows the non-uniqueness for spherical black holes, even among capped black holes. For equivalent sets of conserved charges, we find that the large/small bubble branch can have larger/smaller entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entropy of single-character CFTs on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative approach to calculate the R\'enyi entropy of a single interval on the torus for single-character (meromorphic) conformal field theories. Our prescription uses the Wro\'nskian method of Mathur, Mukhi and Sen, in which we construct differential equations for torus conformal blocks of the twist two-point function. As an illustrative example, we provide a detailed calculation of the second R\'enyi entropy for the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model. We find that the $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of a meromorphic CFT results in a four-character CFT which realizes the toric code modular tensor category. We show that the $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model yields a three-character CFT since two of the characters coincide. We find that the second R\'enyi entropy for the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model has the universal logarithmic divergent behaviour in the decompactification limit of the torus as expected. Furthermore, we see that the $q$-expansion is UV finite, apart from the leading universal logarithmic divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Baikov representation of Feynman integrals in its standard and loop-by-loop variants. The Baikov representation is a parametric representation, which has as its defining feature the fact that the integration variables are the propagators of the Feynman integral. For the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we discuss in detail a strategy for how to make an optimal parametrization which is one that minimizes the number of extra integration variables that have to be introduced for a given Feynman integral. Furthermore, we present a Mathematica implementation, named BaikovPackage, that is able to generate the Baikov representation in its standard and loop-by-loop varieties. We also discuss some subtleties and open problems regarding Baikov representations.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Probing Line Defect CFT with Mixed-Correlator Bootstrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study of the defect CFT on a Maldacena-Wilson line in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory using Bootstrability -- the conformal bootstrap supplemented with exact integrability data. In this paper, we extend this program to charged sectors of the theory, considering a mixed-correlator setup first introduced by Liendo, Meneghelli, and Mitev. The exact spectrum in all channels is given by integrability at any coupling. Additionally, we use exact expressions for some structure constants fixed by localisation and leverage the exact discrete symmetries of the theory. We analyse the remaining data with the numerical bootstrap, developing an algorithm optimised to scan over a large multidimensional space of OPE coefficients and carve the allowed region with the "cutting surface" procedure. We compute upper and lower bounds for 12 OPE coefficients for several values of the coupling. Our results are sharp for the lowest states in each sector but become quite wide for the excited states due to their near degeneracy. This highlights the need for studying the system with non-protected external states and for further input from integrability in the form of integrated correlators of non-protected operators.</description>

Abstract: In this invited review, we discuss the evaporation of a black hole, with emphasis on the resulting macroscopically distinct patterns of Hawking radiation. The density matrix of this radiation can approach a pure final state in the form of a highly entangled macroscopic superposition state. We note that this exact property is exhibited in replica wormhole calculations, and also in quantum hair effects on Hawking radiation amplitudes. Finally, we revisit the information paradox (Mathur's theorem and firewalls), showing that it can be resolved by macroscopic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Tau Functions from Joyce Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argued in [Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Vol. 103, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2021, 1-66, arXiv:1912.06504] that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should give rise to a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions called a Joyce structure. In this paper, we show how to use a Joyce structure to define a generating function which we call the $\tau$-function. When applied to the derived category of the resolved conifold, this reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function of [J. Differential Geom. 115 (2020), 395-435, arXiv:1703.02776]. In the case of the derived category of the Ginzburg algebra of the A$_2$ quiver, we obtain the Painlev\'e I $\tau$-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum (noncommutative) analogue of locally trivial tangent bundle based on two main elements: the definition of local algebras through quotients of ideals of the global algebra as introduced in [21], and the triviality of the local tangent space as being the $\kappa$-Minkowski space inspired from [2]. This tangent bundle is explicitly constructed via local coordinate charts. Every local objects are exported to the global algebra through the notion of quantum (noncommutative) partition of unity introduced in this purpose. This partition is also used to export consistently an integral on $\kappa$-Minkowski to an integral on the global algebra.</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt (WdW) equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time evolution equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)], two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\cO(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments, in particular the new Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment. In the current paper, we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector and for upcoming liquid argon detectors like DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). The proposed method of detection relies on the ``glow'' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO or DUNE photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion of scalar clouds with spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization of black holes typically occurs through the condensation of a scalar field, with the field evolving from a $U(1)$-symmetric phase into a symmetry-breaking one with lower energy. We show that there exist symmetry-breaking phases which are themselves unstable to the formation of an additional scalar condensate, or `cloud', which is partly accreted into the black hole. By studying the fully nonlinear dynamical evolution of the process, we find that symmetry breaking causes the accretion channels of scalar clouds to be non-degenerate, favoring a dominant channel for evolution. Additionally, the final states form a characteristic energy band due to varying amounts of radiation emitted by clouds in different channels.</description>

      <title>On the maximal superintegrability of strongly isochronous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study strongly isochronous Hamiltonians that generate periodic time evolution with the same basic period for a dense set of initial values. We explain that all such Hamiltonians are maximally superintegrable, and show that if the system is subjected to Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact symmetry group and certain conditions are met, then the reduced Hamiltonian is strongly isochronous with the original basic period. We utilize these simple observations for demonstrating the maximal superintegrability of rational spin Calogero--Moser type models in confining harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>A Generally Covariant Model of Spacetime as a 4-Brane in 4+1 Flat Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a simple toy model of a closed FLRW spacetime by starting from a flat five dimensional scalar field space with a quartic potential. The action contains no curvature terms. An SO(4) invariant ansatz for the scalar fields is shown to lead to a linearly expanding universe. The model is fully covariant and the spacetime metric is uniquely determined from the dynamical equations of the metric tensor provided that the cosmological constant is negative.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of Infrared Divergences in $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ in Light Front Coherent State Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the issue of cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences at the amplitude level in Light Front Quantum Chromodynamics (LFQCD) using the coherent state formalism. We consider the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ upto $\mathcal{O}(g^3)$ in light-cone-time-ordered Hamiltonian perturbation theory and show that IR divergences in S-matrix elements appear due to vanishing energy denominators. We construct the coherent state formalism for LFQCD and explicitly show that these divergences are cancelled when a coherent state basis is used for calculating the S-matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.</description>

      <title>Study of symmetries in finite temperature $N_f=2$ QCD with M\"obius Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical temperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action with residual mass $\sim 1\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a good chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial correlators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through various symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also present additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge at sufficiently high temperatures.</description>
