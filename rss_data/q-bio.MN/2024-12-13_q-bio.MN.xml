      <title>Open-source Polymer Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers play a crucial role in the development of engineering materials, with applications ranging from mechanical to biomedical fields. However, the limited polymerization processes constrain the variety of organic building blocks that can be experimentally tested. We propose an open-source computational generative pipeline that integrates neural-network-based discriminators, generators, and query-based filtration mechanisms to overcome this limitation and generate hypothetical polymers. The pipeline targets properties, such as ionization potential (IP), by aligning various representational formats to generate hypothetical polymer candidates. The discriminators demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models due to optimized architecture, while the generators produce novel polymers tailored to the desired property range. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the generative performance of the pipeline components, focusing on the polymers' ionization potential (IP). The developed pipeline is integrated into the DeepChem framework, enhancing its accessibility and compatibility for various polymer generation studies.</description>

      <title>On structural contraction of biological interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological networks function extremely well under severe forms of pertubations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters. Structural dynamical robustness has been proposed as a defining feature of such networks. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity. We build on the previous work of the authors which characterized the long-term dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on "rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect to non-standard polyhederal $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that such networks are non-expansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate our theory with examples from signaling pathways.</description>
