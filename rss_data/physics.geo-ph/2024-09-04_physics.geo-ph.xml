      <title>Pan-European fuel map server: an open-geodata portal for supporting fire risk assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canopy fuels and surface fuel models, topographic features and other canopy attributes such as stand height and canopy cover, provide the necessary spatial datasets required by various fire behaviour modelling simulators. This is a technical note reporting on a pan-European fuel map server, highlighting the methods for the production and validation of canopy features, more specifically canopy fuels, and surface fuel models created for the European Union Horizon 2020 FIRE-RES project, as well as other related data derived from earth observation. The aim was to deliver a fuel cartography in a findable, accessible, interoperable and replicable manner as per F.A.I.R. guiding principles for research data stewardship. We discuss the technology behind sharing large raster datasets via web-GIS technologies and highlight advances and novelty of the shared data. Uncertainty maps related to the canopy fuel variables are also available to give users the expected reliability of the data. Users can view, query and download single layers of interest, or download the whole pan-European dataset. All layers are in raster format and co-registered in the same reference system, extent and spatial resolution (100 m). Viewing and downloading is available at all NUTS scales, ranging from country level (NUTS0) to province level (NUTS3), thus facilitating data management and access. The system was implemented using R for part of the processing and Google Earth Engine. The final app is openly available to the public for accessing the data at various scales.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of marine seismic interference noise employing a customized U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine seismic interference noise occurs when energy from nearby marine seismic source vessels is recorded during a seismic survey. Such noise tends to be well preserved over large distances and cause coherent artifacts in the recorded data. Over the years, the industry has developed various denoising techniques for seismic interference removal, but although well performing they are still time-consuming in use. Machine-learning based processing represents an alternative approach, which may significantly improve the computational efficiency. In case of conventional images, autoencoders are frequently employed for denoising purposes. However, due to the special characteristics of seismic data as well as the noise, autoencoders failed in the case of marine seismic interference noise. We therefore propose the use of a customized U-Net design with element-wise summation as part of the skip-connection blocks to handle the vanishing gradient problem and to ensure information fusion between high- and low-level features. To secure a realistic study, only seismic field data were employed, including 25000 training examples. The customized U-Net was found to perform well leaving only minor residuals, except for the case when seismic interference noise comes from the side. We further demonstrate that such noise can be treated by slightly increasing the depth of our network. Although our customized U-Net does not outperform a standard commercial algorithm in quality, it can (after proper training) read and process one single shot gather in approximately 0.02s. This is significantly faster than any existing industry denoising algorithm. In addition, the proposed network processes shot gathers in a sequential order, which is an advantage compared with industry algorithms that typically require a multi-shot input to break the coherency of the noise.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Vehicle-Induced Distributed Acoustic Sensing Signals for Accurate Urban Near-Surface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous seismic monitoring of the near-surface structure is crucial for urban infrastructure safety, aiding in the detection of sinkholes, subsidence, and other seismic hazards. Utilizing existing telecommunication optical fibers as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems offers a cost-effective method for creating dense seismic arrays in urban areas. DAS leverages roadside fiber-optic cables to record vehicle-induced surface waves for near-surface imaging. However, the influence of roadway vehicle characteristics on their induced surface waves and the resulting imaging of near-surface structures is poorly understood. We investigate surface waves generated by vehicles of varying weights and speeds to provide insights into accurate and efficient near-surface characterization. We first classify vehicles into light, mid-weight, and heavy based on the maximum amplitudes of quasi-static DAS records. Vehicles are also classified by their traveling speed using their arrival times at DAS channels. To investigate how vehicle characteristics influence the induced surface waves, we extract phase velocity dispersion and invert the subsurface structure for each vehicle class by retrieving virtual shot gathers (VSGs). Our results reveal that heavy vehicles produce higher signal-to-noise ratio surface waves, and a sevenfold increase in vehicle weight can reduce uncertainties in phase velocity measurements from dispersion spectra by up to 3X. Thus, data from heavy vehicles better constrain structures at greater depths. Additionally, with driving speeds ranging from 5 to 30 meters per second in our study, differences in the dispersion curves due to vehicle speed are less pronounced than those due to vehicle weight. Our results suggest judiciously selecting and processing surface wave signals from certain vehicle types can improve the quality of near-surface imaging in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods, and their applications in Earth Science. More specifically, the paper presents an overview of causal discovery and causal inference, explains the underlying causal assumptions, and enlists evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the domain area. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth Science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections etc. This survey paper can serve as a primer for Data Science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a list of resources, such as Earth Science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis. It will equally benefit the Earth Science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth Science study.</description>
