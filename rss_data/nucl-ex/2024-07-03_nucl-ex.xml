      <title>Experimental studies of the three nucleon system dynamics in the proton induced deuteron breakup at 108 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential cross sections for the $^2$H(p,pp)n reaction have been measured for 84 angular configurations of the outgoing protons in the range of polar angles from 13 to 33 degrees with a proton beam of 108 MeV. Data have been collected in the Cyclotron Center Bronowice (CCB) at the Institute of Nuclear Physics PAS in Cracow, using the BINA detector setup. Analysis leading to determination of the breakup cross section values is described. Absolute normalization is obtained by normalization to the simultaneously measured $^2$H(p,d)p scattering events.Experimental results are compared to the state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. Global analysis shows significant influence of the Coulomb interaction and small effects of three nucleon force in the studied phase space region.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavor and Quarkonia Results from the PHENIX Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has a unique large rapidity coverage ($1.2 &lt; |y| &lt; 2.2$) for heavy flavor studies in heavy-ion collisions. This kinematic region has a smaller particle density and may undergo different nuclear effects before and after the hard process when compared to mid-rapidity production. The latest PHENIX runs contain a large data set which allows, for the first time, the study of heavy flavor and $J/\psi$ flow at the large rapidity region in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=$200 GeV. This measurement has the potential to reveal a medium evolution distinct from that known at mid-rapidity.</description>

      <title>Vortex Rings in Event-by-Event Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present event-by-event simulations for central asymmetric light+heavy and Au+Au collisions to investigate the formation and evolution of vortex-ring structures in the longitudinal flow velocity profile. The production-plane polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons, defined w.r.t. the $\Lambda$ momentum and the beam, can track the "vortex-ring" feature in the event, a characteristic vortical structure generated by longitudinal flow gradients. We make comprehensive model predictions for the rapidity-dependent vortex-ring observables for different collision system sizes at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ and 72 GeV. Our predictions at the latter energy can be explored in the future LHCb fixed-target experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Slicing Pomerons in ultraperipheral collisions using forward neutrons from nuclear breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that measurements of forward neutrons from nuclear breakup in inclusive high energy photon-nucleus ($\gamma A$) scattering provide a novel way to study small-$x$ dynamics of QCD in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). Using models for hadronic fluctuations of the real photon and neutron emission in nuclear fragmentation, we calculate the distribution over the number of evaporation neutrons produced in $\gamma Pb$ collisions at the LHC. We show that it is correlated with the number of wounded nucleons (inelastic collisions) and, hence, can constrain the mechanism of nuclear shadowing and its $x$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Contribution to differential $\pi^0$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{dir}$ modification in small systems from color fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major complication in the search for jet quenching in proton- or deuteron-nucleus collision systems is the presence of physical effects which influence the experimental determination of collision centrality in the presence of a hard process. For example, in the proton color fluctuation picture, protons with a large Bjorken-$x$ ($x \gtrsim 0.1$) parton interact more weakly with the nucleons in the nucleus, leading to a smaller (larger) than expected yield in large (small) activity events. A recent measurement by PHENIX compared the yield of neutral pion and direct photon production in $d$+Au collisions, under the argument that the photon yields correct for such biases, and the difference between the two species is thus attributable to final-state effects (i.e., jet quenching). The main finding suggests a significant degree of jet quenching for hard processes in small systems. In this paper, I argue that the particular photon and pion events selected by PHENIX arise from proton configurations with significantly different Bjorken-$x$ distributions, and thus are subject to different magnitudes of modification in the color fluctuation model. Using the results of a previous global analysis of RHIC and LHC data, I show that potentially all of the pion-to-photon difference in PHENIX data can be described by a proton color fluctuation picture at a quantitative level before any additional physics from final-state effects is required. This finding reconciles the interpretation of the PHENIX measurement with others at RHIC and LHC, which have found no observable evidence for jet quenching in small systems.</description>
