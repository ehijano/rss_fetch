      <title>Simulating Physics with Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feynman gave in 1982 a keynote speech \textit{Simulating Physics with Computers} (Int. J. Theor. Phys. {\bf 21}, 467 (1982)) in which he talked ``...about the possibility...that the computer will do exactly the same as nature". The motivation was that: ``...the physical world is quantum mechanical, and therefore the proper problem is the simulation of quantum physics". Here I try after more than forty years to answer Feynman's question of whether it is possible to perform exact computer simulations. Many computer simulations are not exact, they contain mean field approximations that disobey the symmetry in the quantum dynamics with Newton's third law, e.g. almost all astrophysical simulations of galaxy systems. After a review of computer simulations and the problems of simulating real systems, I argue that Newton's discrete dynamics, which is used in almost all computer simulations and which is exact in the same sense as Newton's analytic dynamics, is the classical limit path of Feynman's quantum paths. However, the physical world is not known exactly and it is much more complex than any simulated systems, and so far no real systems have been simulated exactly. Hence, more than forty years later, and after hundreds of thousands of computer simulations of the physical system's dynamics the answer to Feynman's question is still negative. But although it is not possible to simulate the dynamics exactly for any real systems, the simulations have been and will be of great use in Natural Science.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of electromagnetic mass and 4/3-problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article one aspect of the so-called '4/3-problem' is analyzed, namely definitions of the electromagnetic mass of the classical electron. It is shown that if the special relativity definition of the electromagnetic (EM) mass as the ratio of the electromagnetic field energy to the square of the speed of light is correctly treated by the scientists who considered this probem, the second definition, which originated with Thomson, i.e. a coefficient of proportionality of the EM momentum of the particle and its velocity has another physical meaning. This meaning was explained by Frenkel in his textbook on clssical electrodynamics. According to this scientist, the second EM mass is actualy a self-inductance of the classical electron or the reaction of its magnetic field to a change in the velocity of this particle. Consequently, these two physical quantities have different meanings, and attempts to reduce the expression for one mass to an expression for the second mass have always been unsuccessful.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the most generalized form of Holographic Dark Energy and some particular cases with Corrected Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic cut-off in generalized dark energy (HDE) formalism depends on its cut-off. Following this, a four-parameter generalized entropy has recently been developed. It reduces to various known entropies for appropriate parameter limits in the study of Odintsov, S. D., S. DOnofrio, and T. Paul. (2023) Physics of the Dark Universe, 42 pp: 101277. In the current work, we investigate the evolution of the universe in its early phase and late phase within the framework of entropic cosmology, where the entropic energy density functions are reconstructed within the framework of the equivalence of holographic dark energy and four-parameter generalized entropy (Sg). Along with the reconstruction as mentioned earlier scheme, in this study, we demonstrate that an extensive variety of dark energy (DE) models can be considered distinct and particular candidates for the most generalized four-parameter entropic HDE family, each having their cut-off. We examined several entropic dark energy models in this regard, including the generalized holographic dark energy with Nojiri-Odintsov(NO) cut-off, the Barrow entropic HDE (BHDE) with particle horizon as IR cut-off, the Tsallis entropic HDE (THDE) with future event horizon as IR cut-off, all of three cases are particular cases of the most generalized four parameter entropic holographic dark energy. Inspired by S. Nojiri, and S. D. Odintsov (2006) (General Relativity and Gravitation, 38 p: 1285-1304 ) and (S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov, 2017, European Physical Journal C, 77, pp.1-8 ); our current work reports a study on cosmological parameters and thermodynamics with entropy-corrections (logarithmic and power-law) to cosmological horizon entropy as well as black hole entropy with a highly generalized viscous coupled holographic dark fluid along its particular cases.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Rhythms of Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof in quantum theory made twenty years ago prompts interrelated developments in physics, biology, graph theory, and the philosophy of science. The proof shows an ineradicable need for guesswork, beyond logic, to link physical evidence to any theoretical explanation. In physics and in biology, recognizing guesswork reveals a kind of synchronization, found in digital computer hardware but overlooked in theoretical physics, with implications for a biological basis to the concepts of time and distance in physics.
  By refuting the assumption that "physical" implies "eventually entirely explicable," the proof inspires renewed attention to experimental practice. Pervasive in the practice of modern science, digital computation and communications depends on physically distinct conditions and transitions among them. Organizing these conditions and transitions depends on a form of synchronization unlike that usual in physics. As shown here, this logical synchronization: (1) is essential to computing and digital communications networks, and (2) requires guesswork for its maintenance, whether directly or in the design of automated maintenance.
  By abstracting digital hardware, we model human thinking as logically synchronized computation, punctuated by unforeseeable changes. We adapt marked graphs to sharpen understandings of computation, whether it is electronic or takes place in living organisms. The marked graphs reveal a logical substructure to spatial and temporal navigation, with implications across physics and its applications to other sciences. By limiting our model to thelogical aspect of communications and computations -- leaving out energy, weight, shape, etc. -- we reveal logical structure applicable not just in electronics but also to the functioning of living organisms.</description>

      <title>Bell inequalities violation in relativity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A violation of Bell local realism inequalities in Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) form has been discovered in a relativistic GedanknExperiment. This means that there are no definite joint probabilities and this finds a classical explanation in the structure of Special relativity (SRT). The discovered nonlocality is weaker than Albert Einstein's quantum 'spooky action at a distance', and its presence suggests certain parallels between special relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of gravity in a framework of emergent quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the emergent origin of gravity in the framework of Hamilton-Randers theory, a theoretical framework for emergent quantum mechanics. After presenting the essential ingredients of the theory, a derivation of the weak equivalence principle from the first principles of the theory follows. Then it is shown that the Newtonian model of gravity and certain modified gravity models are consistent with Hamilton-Randers theory. One of these models has strong formal resemblance with MOND, providing further ground to think that Hamilton-Randers theory could be a natural theoretical frame for realistic modified gravity models.</description>
