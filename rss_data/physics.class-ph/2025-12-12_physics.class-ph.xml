      <title>Classical Dirac particle: Mass and Spin invariance and radiation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the atomic principle an elementary particle has no excited states and under any interaction, if it is not annihilated, its internal structure cannot be modified. The intrinsic properties are the mass $m$ and the absolute value of the spin in the center of mass frame $S=\hbar/2$. We analyze the closed system made of a single Dirac particle and an external electromagnetic field. The Poincar\'e invariance of the dynamics implies that the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum of the whole system must be conserved. The Dirac particle has two distinguished points, the center of charge ${\bf r}$ and the center of mass ${\bf q}$. When interacting, the energy expended by the field is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of charge trajectory. The variation of the mechanical energy of the particle is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of mass trajectory. If these two works are different the excess of energy must be transformed into radiation returning that energy to the field. The accelerated Dirac particle radiates. We analyze the spin dynamics of the Dirac particle under an external electromagnetic field. The requirement that the absolute value of the spin for the center of mass observer cannot be modified by the interaction implies a modification of the dynamical equation which includes a new braking term along the center of mass velocity, that can be interpreted as the radiation reaction force.</description>

      <title>Influence of the basins of attractions in the register jumps of the clarinet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When playing the clarinet, opening the register hole allows for a transition from the first to the second register, producing a twelfth interval. On an artificial mouth, the blowing pressure range where the second register remains stable can be determined by gradually varying the blowing pressure while keeping the register hole open. However, when the register hole is opened while the instrument is already producing the first register, the range of blowing pressures that lead to a stable second register is narrower than the full stability zone of the second register. This phenomenon is investigated numerically by performing multiple hole openings at different times for each blowing pressure value. The evolution of the probability of reaching the second register is computed, and its relationship with the structure of the basin of attraction of the second register is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Fitting magnetization data using continued fraction of straight lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.</description>

      <title>Conjugate gradient for ill-posed problems: regularization by preconditioning, preconditioning by regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates using the conjugate gradient iterative solver for ill-posed problems. We show that preconditioner and Tikhonov-regularization work in conjunction. In particular when they employ the same symmetric positive semi-definite operator, a powerful Ritz analysis allows one to estimate at negligible computational cost the solution for any Tikhonov's weight. This enhanced linear solver is applied to the boundary data completion problem and as the inner solver for the optical flow estimator.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent X-Ray Oscilex Radiation from a FEL-Modulated Positron Bunch during Its Planar Channeling in a Crystalline Undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted at zero angle by a microbunched positron bunch undergoing planar channeling in a crystalline undulator (CU) is studied. The bunch energy is assumed to be far above the threshold for radiation generation in the dispersive CU medium. Besides the usual ``hard'' undulator radiation produced by channeling oscillations (channeling undulator radiation) and by the CU bending (crystalline undulator radiation), a ``soft'' medium-polarization component also appears at zero angle due to the oscillations that excite atomic electrons. We refer to this soft component as Oscilex (oscillationally-excited) radiation. Since the two types of oscillations have different frequencies, they yield two distinct frequency components of both undulator and Oscilex radiation. The Oscilex frequencies are set by the plasma frequency and the characteristic oscillation frequency and are, to high accuracy, independent of the positron energy. The CU period is chosen so that the radiation wavelength is not shorter than the microbunch length, ensuring coherent emission from microbunches and partially coherent Oscilex emission from the full bunch. Analytical expressions are obtained for the spectral line shapes and the number of photons of spontaneous Oscilex radiation. For partially coherent emission, Gaussian distributions are used for both the bunch and microbunches. Gain factors for the two Oscilex components, including longitudinal form-factors, and the total number of partially coherent photons are derived. A positron bunch with LCLS parameters, modulated by SASE XFEL, channeling between (1 1 0) planes of a periodically bent diamond crystal is analyzed. The number of spontaneously emitted Oscilex photons exceeds the number of positrons by $1\text{{\div}}2$ orders of magnitude, and the gain factors reach $10^3 \text{{\div}} 10^4$.</description>

      <title>AI-Newton: A Concept-Driven Physical Law Discovery System without Prior Physical Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current AI-driven methods excel at deriving empirical models from individual experiments, a significant challenge remains in uncovering the common fundamental physics that underlie these models -- a task at which human physicists are adept. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-Newton, a novel framework for concept-driven scientific discovery. Our system autonomously derives general physical laws directly from raw, multi-experiment data, operating without supervision or prior physical knowledge. Its core innovations are twofold: (1) proposing interpretable physical concepts to construct laws, and (2) progressively generalizing these laws to broader domains. Applied to a large, noisy dataset of mechanics experiments, AI-Newton successfully rediscovers foundational and universal laws, such as Newton's second law, the conservation of energy, and the universal gravitation. This work represents a significant advance toward autonomous, human-like scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>
