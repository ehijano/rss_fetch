      <title>Measurement-Based Modeling and Analysis of UAV Air-Ground Channels at 1 and 4 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless communications, a better understanding of propagation characteristics and an accurate channel model are required. Measurements and comprehensive analysis for the UAV-based air-ground (AG) propagation channel in the vertical dimension are presented in this letter. Based on the measurement data at 1 and 4 GHz, the large-scale and small-scale channel parameters are extracted in the line-of-sight (LOS) and nonLOS case, respectively. The altitude-dependent path loss model is proposed herein. Furthermore, shadow fading and fast fading are statistically analyzed for comprehensively describing the fading behavior. Our results will be useful in the modeling of AG channels and the performance analysis for UAV-enabled wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>5G Channel Models for Railway Use Cases at mmWave Band and the Path Towards Terahertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed trains are one of the most relevant scenarios for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications and the "smart rail mobility" vision, where a high-data-rate wireless connectivity with up to several GHz bandwidths will be required. This is a strong motivation for the exploration of millimeter wave (mmWave) band. In this article, we identify the main challenges and make progress towards realistic 5G mmWave channel models for railway use cases. In order to cope with the challenge of including the railway features in the channel models, we define reference scenarios to help the parameterization of channel models for railway use at mmWave band. Simulations and the subsequent measurements used to validate the model reflect the detailed influence of railway objects and the accuracy of the simulations. Finally, we point out the future directions towards the full version of the smart rail mobility which will be powered by terahertz (THz) communications.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Weighted Averaging Over-the-Air Computation and Its Application to Distributed Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-tolerant computing method for over-the-air computation (AirComp) aimed at weighted averaging, which is critical in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional AirComp approaches, while efficient, suffer significantly in accuracy due to noise enhancement in the normalization by the sum of weights. Our proposed method allows nodes to adaptively truncate their weights based on the channel conditions, thereby enhancing noise tolerance. Applied to distributed Gaussian process regression, the method facilitates low-latency, low-complexity, and high-accuracy distributed regression across a range of signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a radio map construction problem, which is a task for visualizing the radio environment based on limited sensing information and spatial interpolation. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach not only maintains computational accuracy in high noise scenarios but also achieves performance close to ideal conditions in high SNR environments. This advancement holds significant implications for the deployment of real-time, large-scale IoT systems, providing a scalable solution to enhance reliability and efficiency in data-driven environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Predictive Beamforming with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, roadside units (RSUs) can be tasked with both sensing and communication functions to enable sensing-assisted communications. Recent studies have demonstrated that distance, angle, and velocity information obtained through sensing can be leveraged to reduce the overhead associated with communication beam tracking. In this work, we extend this concept to scenarios involving multiple distributed RSUs and distributed MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. We derive the state evolution model, formulate the extended Kalman-filter equations, and implement predictive beamforming for distributed MIMO. Simulation results indicate that, when compared with a co-located massive MIMO antenna array, distributed antennas lead to more uniform and robust sensing performance, coverage, and data rates, while the vehicular user is in motion.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Multi-Target Detection in ELAA ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-target detection and communication with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating at high frequencies necessitate generating multiple beams. However, conventional algorithms are slow and computationally intensive. For instance, they can simulate a \num{200}-antenna system over two weeks, and the time complexity grows exponentially with the number of antennas. Thus, this letter explores an ultra-low-complex solution for a multi-user, multi-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system equipped with an ELAA base station (BS). It maximizes the communication sum rate while meeting sensing beampattern gain targets and transmit power constraints. As this problem is non-convex, a Riemannian stochastic gradient descent-based augmented Lagrangian manifold optimization (SGALM) algorithm is developed, which searches on a manifold to ensure constraint compliance. The algorithm achieves ultra-low complexity and superior runtime performance compared to conventional algorithms. For example, it is \num{56} times faster than the standard benchmark for \num{257} BS antennas.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Channel- and Coding-Based Challenge-Response Physical-Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a new physical layer authentication mechanism operating at the physical layer of a communication system where the receiver has partial control of the channel conditions (e.g., using an intelligent reflecting surface). We aim to exploit both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and a secret shared key for authentication. This is achieved by both transmitting an identifying key by wiretap coding (to conceal the key from the attacker) and checking that the instantaneous CSI corresponds to the channel configuration randomly selected by the receiver. We investigate the trade-off between the pilot signals used for CSI estimation and the coding rate (or key length) to improve the overall security of the authentication procedure.</description>

      <title>VoicePrompter: Robust Zero-Shot Voice Conversion with Voice Prompt and Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in recent voice conversion (VC) systems, enhancing speaker similarity in zero-shot scenarios remains challenging. This challenge arises from the difficulty of generalizing and adapting speaker characteristics in speech within zero-shot environments, which is further complicated by mismatch between the training and inference processes. To address these challenges, we propose VoicePrompter, a robust zero-shot VC model that leverages in-context learning with voice prompts. VoicePrompter is composed of (1) a factorization method that disentangles speech components and (2) a DiT-based conditional flow matching (CFM) decoder that conditions on these factorized features and voice prompts. Additionally, (3) latent mixup is used to enhance in-context learning by combining various speaker features. This approach improves speaker similarity and naturalness in zero-shot VC by applying mixup to latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that VoicePrompter outperforms existing zero-shot VC systems in terms of speaker similarity, speech intelligibility, and audio quality. Our demo is available at \url{https://hayeong0.github.io/VoicePrompter-demo/}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stochastic Polar Decoder With Correlated Stochastic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar codes have gained significant attention in channel coding for their ability to approach the capacity of binary input discrete memoryless channels (B-DMCs), thanks to their reliability and efficiency in transmission. However, existing decoders often struggle to balance hardware area and performance. Stochastic computing offers a way to simplify circuits, and previous work has implemented decoding using this approach. A common issue with these methods is performance degradation caused by the introduction of correlation. This paper presents an Efficient Correlated Stochastic Polar Decoder (ECS-PD) that fundamentally addresses the issue of the `hold-state', preventing it from increasing as correlation computation progresses. We propose two optimization strategies aimed at reducing iteration latency, increasing throughput, and simplifying the circuit to improve hardware efficiency. The optimization can reduce the number of iterations by 25.2% at $E_b/N_0$ = 3 dB. Compared to other efficient designs, the proposed ECS-PD achieves higher throughput and is 2.7 times more hardware-efficient than the min-sum decoder.</description>

      <title>Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk from a given torque demand, addressing the limitations of sparse real-world datasets. Specifically, we implement unconditional and conditional VAEs to generate jerk signals that integrate features from different drivetrain scenarios. The VAEs are trained on experimental data collected from two variants of a fully electric SUV, which differ in maximum torque delivery and drivetrain configuration. New meaningful jerk signals are generated within an engineering context through the interpretation of the VAE's latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs. We show that VAEs bypass the need for exhaustive manual system parametrization while maintaining physical plausibility by conditioning data generation on specific inputs.</description>

      <title>Private Information Retrieval on Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access with Integrated Sensing and Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system is introduced herein. This system features a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) that seamlessly merges sensing with backscatter communication and supports multiple users. Multiple access (MA) for the user is provided by employing rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA, unlike other classical orthogonal and non-orthogonal MA schemes, splits messages into common and private streams. With RSMA, the set of common rate forms can be optimized to reduce interference. Optimized formulas are thus derived for communication rates for users, tags, and the BS's sensing rate, with the primary goal of enhancing the transmission efficiency of the BS. The optimization task involves minimizing the BS's overall transmission power by jointly optimizing the BS's beamforming vectors, the tag reflection coefficients, and user common rates. The alternating optimization method is employed to address this challenge. Concrete solutions are provided for the received beamformers, and semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization techniques are adopted for transmit beamformers and reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, the proposed RSMA-assisted ISABC system achieves a 350% communication rate boost over a nonorthogonal multiple access-assisted ISABC, with only a 24% increase in transmit power, leveraging ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS.</description>

      <title>Doppler Power Spectrum in Channels with von Mises-Fisher Distribution of Scatterers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical analysis of the Doppler spectrum in von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering channels. A simple closed-form expression for the Doppler spectrum is derived and used to investigate the impact of the vMF scattering parameters, i.e., the mean direction and the degree of concentration of scatterers. The spectrum is observed to exhibit exponential behavior for mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean direction of scatterers, while conforming to a Gaussian-like shape for the perpendicular motion. The validity of the obtained results is verified by comparison against the results of Monte Carlo simulations, where an exact match is observed.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for RIS Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning offers promising methods for processing signals recorded with wearable devices such as surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, in these applications, despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be applied to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperformed standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study showed that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>
