      <title>Controlling instability in the Vlasov-Poisson system through moment-based optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling instability in plasma is one of the central challenges in fusion energy research. Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally, moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Quasi-Monte Carlo via Combinatorial Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are classical approaches for the numerical integration of functions $f$ over $[0,1]^d$. While QMC methods can achieve faster convergence rates than MC in moderate dimensions, their tractability in high dimensions typically relies on additional structure -- such as low effective dimension or carefully chosen coordinate weights -- since worst-case error bounds grow prohibitively large as $d$ increases.
  In this work, we study the construction of high-dimensional QMC point sets via combinatorial discrepancy, extending the recent QMC method of Bansal and Jiang. We establish error bounds for these constructions in weighted function spaces, and for functions with low effective dimension in both the superposition and truncation sense. We also present numerical experiments to empirically assess the performance of these constructions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). By extending the classical Butcher theory from ordinary differential equations to the BSDE setting, we systematically derive order conditions for schemes with arbitrary numbers of stages and orders. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Convergence and error analysis of a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Gray--Scott system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Gray--Scott system, a model for pattern formation in chemical and biological media. We prove unconditional well-posedness of the fully discrete problem and establish qualitative properties, including positivity and boundedness of the numerical solution. A convergence result is obtained by compactness arguments, showing that the discrete approximations converge strongly to a weak solution of the continuous system. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further derive a priori error estimates in the $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical analysis, confirm a rate of convergence of order 1, and illustrate the ability of the scheme to capture classical Gray--Scott patterns.</description>

      <title>An online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for parameterized component-based nonlinear systems using hierarchical error estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for model order reduction of parameterized, component-based nonlinear systems. The method, in the offline phase, prepares a library of hyperreduced archetype components of various fidelity levels and, in the online phase, assembles the target system using instantiated components whose fidelity is adaptively selected to satisfy a user-prescribed system-level error tolerance. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical error estimation framework that compares solutions at successive fidelity levels and drives a local refinement strategy based on component-wise error indicators. We also provide an efficient estimator for the system-level error to ensure that the adaptive strategy meets the desired accuracy. Component-wise hyperreduction is performed using an empirical quadrature procedure, with the training accuracy guided by the Brezzi--Rappaz--Raviart theorem. The proposed method is demonstrated on a family of nonlinear thermal fin systems comprising up to 225 components and 68 parameters. Numerical results show that the hyperreduced basis element model achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level relative to the truth finite-element model. In addition, the adaptive refinement strategy provides more effective error control than uniform refinement by selectively enriching components with higher local errors.</description>

      <title>Numerical Integration of stochastic differential equations: The Heun Algorithm Revisited and It\^o-Stratonovich Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun scheme.</description>

      <title>Momentum Equation-Based Regularization and Image Registration for Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Evaluate and compare multiple mechanics-based and traditional regularization strategies within a variational image registration framework for quasi-static ultrasound elastography. Methods:We reformulate a previously proposed momentum-equation-based post-processing method (SPREME) as a regularization term directly integrated into an image registration energy functional. Four regularization types are implemented and compared: a strain magnitude ($\R_\epsilon$), a strain magnitude with incompressibility constraint ($R_{\epsilon i}$), and a momentum-based regularization under plane strain ($R_{P\epsilon}$) and plane stress ($R_{P\sigma}$) assumptions. Each is evaluated in a variational framework solved via Gauss-Newton optimization. Data:Registration performance is assessed using synthetic ultrasound image sequences generated from 2D and 3D finite element simulations, as well as experimental phantom data. Comparisons are based on displacement and strain field errors, strain contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Results: Momentum-based regularization, particularly under plane stress assumptions ($R_{P\sigma}$), achieved the lowest strain errors and highest strain contrast across both single-frame and accumulated measurements, even when the underlying tissue deformation violated 2D assumptions. In contrast, strain magnitude regularization with an incompressibility constraint ($R_{\epsilon i}$) produced unstable results in 3D and accumulated displacement scenarios. Conclusions: Mechanics-based regularization that incorporates momentum conservation outperforms strain-based techniques in elastographic image registration, particularly when applied directly in the optimization framework. This approach improves robustness to noise and model mismatch, offering a promising direction for future displacement-based inverse imaging methods.</description>

      <title>Approximating functions on ${\mathbb R}^+$ by exponential sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for approximating real-valued functions on ${\mathbb R}^+$ by linear combinations of exponential functions with complex coefficients. The approach is based on a multi-point Pad\'e approximation of the Laplace transform and employs a highly efficient continued fraction technique to construct the corresponding rational approximant. We demonstrate the accuracy of this method through a variety of examples, including the Gaussian function, probability density functions of the lognormal and Gompertz-Makeham distributions, the hockey stick and unit step functions, as well as a function arising in the approximation of the gamma and Barnes $G$-functions.</description>

      <title>Stoch-IDENT: New Method and Mathematical Analysis for Identifying SPDEs from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Stoch-IDENT, a novel method for identifying Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) from observational data. Our method can handle linear and nonlinear high-order SPDEs driven by time-dependent Wiener processes with both additive or multiplicative structures. Theoretically, we establish a rigorous connection between the spectral properties of the solution's mean and covariance and the identifiability of the underlying SPDEs. Our analysis covers key classes of equations, including linear SPDEs with constant coefficients, as well as parabolic and hyperbolic types, generalizing the theory of identification of deterministic PDEs. Algorithmically, the drift term is identified using a sample mean generalization of Robust-IDENT (He et al., 2023). For the diffusion term, we develop a new greedy algorithm, Quadratic Subspace Pursuit (QSP), which can address general sparse regression problems with quadratic measurements. We validate Stoch-IDENT extensively on various SPDEs, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>A parametric finite element method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations on an evolving surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of the incompressible surface Navier--Stokes equations on an evolving surface. For the discrete representation of the moving surface we use parametric finite elements of degree $\ell \geq 2$. In the semidiscrete continuous-in-time setting we are able to prove a stability estimate that mimics a corresponding result for the continuous problem. Some numerical results, including a convergence experiment, demonstrate the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an implicit Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for incompressible two-phase flows using an artificial compressibility formulation. The conservative level set (CLS) method is employed in combination with a reinitialization procedure to capture the moving interface. A projection method based on the L-stable TR-BDF2 method is adopted for the time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations and of the level set method. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is employed to enhance the resolution in correspondence of the interface between the two fluids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a number of classical benchmarks. A specific analysis on the influence of different choices of the mixture viscosity is also carried out.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Approximation Rates for Deep Super ReLU Networks on Sobolev Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) as a method for approximating functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms $W^{m,p}$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m\ge 2$ and $1\le p\le +\infty$. Standard ReLU deep neural networks (ReLU DNNs) cannot achieve this goal. DSRNs consist primarily of ReLU DNNs, and several layers of the square of ReLU added at the end to smooth the networks output. This approach retains the advantages of ReLU DNNs, leading to the straightforward training. The paper also proves the optimality of DSRNs by estimating the VC-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs, and obtains the generalization error in Sobolev spaces via an estimate of the pseudo-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a continuous approach to computing the pseudospectra of linear operators with compact or compact-plus-scalar resolvent, following a 'solve-then-discretize' strategy. Instead of taking a finite section approach or using a finite-dimensional matrix to approximate the operator of interest, the new method employs an operator analogue of the Lanczos process to work with operators and functions directly. The method is shown to be free of spectral pollution and spectral invisibility, fully adaptive, and nearly optimal in accuracy. The advantages of the method are demonstrated by extensive numerical examples and comparison with the traditional method.</description>

      <title>Learning a robust shape parameter for RBF approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial basis functions (RBFs) play an important role in function interpolation, in particular in an arbitrary set of interpolation nodes. The accuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape parameter. There are many approaches in literature on how to appropriately choose it as to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding instability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter value in general remains a challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach to determine the shape parameter in RBFs. First, we construct an optimisation problem to obtain a shape parameter that leads to an interpolation matrix with bounded condition number, then, we introduce a data-driven method that controls the condition of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable interpolations, while keeping a very good accuracy. In addition, a fall-back procedure is proposed to enforce a strict upper bound on the condition number, as well as a learning strategy to improve the performance of the data-driven method by learning from previously run simulations. We present numerical test cases to assess the performance of the proposed methods in interpolation tasks and in a RBF based finite difference (RBF-FD) method, in one and two-space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spherical quasi-interpolation using scaled zonal kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a new quasi-interpolation method on spheres featuring the following two-phase construction and analysis. In Phase I, we analyze and characterize a large family of zonal kernels (e.g., the spherical version of Poisson kernel, Gaussian, compactly-supported radial kernels), so that the underlying spherical convolution operators (upon the introduction of a scaling parameter) attains a high-order of approximation to target functions. In Phase II, we discretize the spherical integrals utilizing quadrature rules of optimal order to produce the final quasi-interpolants. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new quasi-interpolation algorithm is robust and amenable to integrated as well as distributed ways of implementation. Moreover, the underlying error-analysis shows that by fine-tuning the scaling parameter in the radial kernels employed, the resulting quasi-interpolants achieve a well-balanced trade-off between approximation and sampling errors.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Fourier extension based on boundary interval data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel boundary-optimized fast Fourier extension algorithm for efficient approximation of non-periodic functions. The proposed methodology constructs periodic extensions through strategic utilization of boundary interval data, which is subsequently combined with original function samples to form an extended periodic representation. We develop a parameter optimization framework that preserves superalgebraic convergence while requiring only a few boundary node deployment, resulting in computational complexity marginally exceeding that of standard FFT implementations. Furthermore, we present an improved version of the algorithm tailored for functions exhibiting boundary oscillations. This variant employs grid refinement near the boundaries, which reduces the resolution constant to approximately one-fourth of that in conventional approaches. Comprehensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods and establish practical guidelines for parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Data Compression using Rank-1 Lattices for Parameter Estimation in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean squared error and regularized versions of it are standard loss functions in supervised machine learning. However, calculating these losses for large data sets can be computationally demanding. Modifying an approach of J. Dick and M. Feischl [Journal of Complexity 67 (2021)], we present algorithms to reduce extensive data sets to a smaller size using rank-1 lattices. Rank-1 lattices are quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) point sets that are, if carefully chosen, well-distributed in a multidimensional unit cube. The compression strategy in the preprocessing step assigns every lattice point a pair of weights depending on the original data and responses, representing its relative importance. As a result, the compressed data makes iterative loss calculations in optimization steps much faster. We analyze the errors of our QMC data compression algorithms and the cost of the preprocessing step for functions whose Fourier coefficients decay sufficiently fast so that they lie in certain Wiener algebras or Korobov spaces. In particular, we prove that our approach can lead to arbitrary high convergence rates as long as the functions are sufficiently smooth.</description>

      <title>An alternating low-rank projection approach for partial differential equations with random inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that standard stochastic Galerkin methods face challenges when solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with random inputs. These challenges are typically attributed to the large number of required physical basis functions and stochastic basis functions. Therefore, it becomes crucial to select effective basis functions to properly reduce the dimensionality of both the physical and stochastic approximation spaces. In this study, our focus is on the stochastic Galerkin approximation associated with generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). We delve into the low-rank approximation of the quasimatrix, whose columns represent the coefficients in the gPC expansions of the solution. We conduct an investigation into the singular value decomposition (SVD) of this quasimatrix, proposing a strategy to identify the rank required for a desired accuracy. Subsequently, we introduce both a simultaneous low-rank projection approach and an alternating low-rank projection approach to compute the low-rank approximation of the solution for PDEs with random inputs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods for both diffusion and Helmholtz problems.</description>

Abstract: Hybridizable \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conforming finite elements for symmetric tensors on simplices with barycentric refinement are developed in this work for arbitrary dimensions and any polynomial order. By employing barycentric refinement and an intrinsic tangential-normal (\(t\)-\(n\)) decomposition, novel basis functions are constructed to redistribute degrees of freedom while preserving \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conformity and symmetry, and ensuring inf-sup stability. These hybridizable elements enhance computational flexibility and efficiency, with applications to mixed finite element methods for linear elasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-order linear positivity preserving schemes in time are available for the time dependent Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, second-order linear ones are still challenging. In this paper, we propose the first- and second-order exponential time differencing schemes with the finite difference spatial discretization for PNP equations, based on the Slotboom transformation of the Nernst-Planck equation. The proposed schemes are linear and preserve the mass conservation and positivity preservation of ion concentration at full discrete level without any constraints on the time step size. The corresponding energy stability analysis is also presented, demonstrating that the second-order scheme can dissipate the modified energy. Extensive numerical results are carried out to support the theoretical findings and showcase the performance of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Inverse inequalities for kernel-based approximation on bounded domains and Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes inverse inequalities for kernel-based approximation spaces defined on bounded Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and compact Riemannian manifolds. While inverse inequalities are well-studied for polynomial spaces, their extension to kernel-based trial spaces poses significant challenges. For bounded Lipschitz domains, we extend prior Bernstein inequalities, which only apply to a limited range of Sobolev orders, to all orders on the lower bound and $L_2$ on the upper, and derive Nikolskii inequalities that bound $L_\infty$ norms by $L_2$ norms. Our theory achieves the desired form but may require slightly more smoothness on the kernel than the regular $&gt;d/2$ assumption. For compact Riemannian manifolds, we focus on restricted kernels, which are defined as the restriction of positive definite kernels from the ambient Euclidean space to the manifold, and prove their counterparts.</description>

      <title>A convergence framework for energy minimisation of linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs in nonlinear approximation spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of nonlinear methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). While these approaches often perform well in practice, their theoretical analysis remains limited, especially regarding convergence guarantees. This work develops a general optimisation framework for energy minimisation problems arising from linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs, formulated over nonlinear but analytically tractable approximation spaces. The framework accommodates a natural split between linear and nonlinear parameters and supports hybrid optimisation strategies: linear variables are updated via linear solves or steepest descent, while nonlinear variables are handled using constrained projected descent. We establish both local and global convergence of the resulting algorithm under modular structural assumptions on the discrete energy functional, including differentiability, boundedness, regularity, and directional convexity. These assumptions are stated in an abstract form, allowing the framework to apply to a broad class of nonlinear approximation manifolds. In a companion paper [Magueresse, Badia (2025, arXiv:2508.17705)], we introduce a concrete instance of such a space based on overlapping free-knot tensor-product B-splines, which satisfies the required assumptions and enables geometrically adaptive solvers with rigorous convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Energy minimisation using overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-splines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately solving PDEs with localised features requires refined meshes that adapt to the solution. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite elements, are linear in nature and often ineffective for such problems, as the mesh is not tailored to the solution. Adaptive strategies, such as $h$- and $p$-refinement, improve efficiency by sequentially refining the mesh based on a posteriori error estimates. However, these methods are geometrically rigid -- limited to specific refinement rules -- and require solving the problem on a sequence of adaptive meshes, which can be computationally expensive. Moreover, the design of effective a posteriori error estimates is problem-dependent and non-trivial. In this work, we study a specific nonlinear approximation scheme based on overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-spline patches, where knot positions act as nonlinear parameters controlling the geometry of the discretisation. We analyse the corresponding energy minimisation problem for linear, self-adjoint elliptic PDEs, showing that, under a mild mesh size condition, the discrete energy satisfies the structural properties required for the local and global convergence of the constrained optimisation scheme developed in our companion work [Magueresse, Badia (2025, arXiv:2508.17687)]. This establishes a direct connection between the two analyses: the adaptive free-knot B-spline space considered here fits into the abstract framework, ensuring convergence of projected gradient descent for the joint optimisation of knot positions and coefficients. Numerical experiments illustrate the method's efficiency and its ability to capture localised features with significantly fewer degrees of freedom than standard finite element discretisations.</description>

      <title>Network inference via approximate Bayesian computation. Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</description>

      <title>Frank-Wolfe algorithm for DC optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we formulate two versions of Frank--Wolfe algorithm or conditional gradient method to solve the DC optimization problem with an adaptive step size. The DC objective function consists of two components; the first is thought to be differentiable with a continuous Lipschitz gradient, while the second is only thought to be convex. The second version is based on the first and employs finite differences to approximate the gradient of the first component of the objective function. In contrast to past formulations that used the curvature/Lipschitz-type constant of the objective function, the step size computed does not require any constant associated with the components. For the first version, we established that the algorithm is well-defined of the algorithm and that every limit point of the generated sequence is a stationary point of the problem. We also introduce the class of weak-star-convex functions and show that, despite the fact that these functions are non-convex in general, the rate of convergence of the first version of the algorithm to minimize these functions is ${\cal O}(1/k)$. The finite difference used to approximate the gradient in the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is computed with the step-size adaptively updated using two previous iterations. Unlike previous applications of finite difference in the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which provided approximate gradients with absolute error, the one used here provides us with a relative error, simplifying the algorithm analysis. In this case, we show that all limit points of the generated sequence for the second version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm are stationary points for the problem under consideration, and we establish that the rate of convergence for the duality gap is ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{k})$.</description>

Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent method for approximate solution of Fredholm equations of the first kind, we develop a corresponding method for a class of Fredholm equations of the \emph{second kind}. In particular, we consider the class of equations for which the solution is a probability measure. The approach centres around specifying a functional whose gradient flow admits a minimizer corresponding to a regularized version of the solution of the underlying equation and using a mean-field particle system to approximately simulate that flow. Theoretical support for the method is presented, along with some illustrative numerical results.</description>

      <title>From Taylor Series to Fourier Synthesis: The Periodic Linear Unit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>
