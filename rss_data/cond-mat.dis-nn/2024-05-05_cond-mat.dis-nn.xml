      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in quasiperiodically disordered chains from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <title>Many-body Localization Transition of Ising Spin-1 Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the many-body localization properties of one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains by using the methods of exact matrix diagonalization. We compare it with the MBL properties of the Ising spin-1/2 chains. The results indicate that the one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains can also undergo MBL phase transition. There are various forms of disorder, and we compare the effects of different forms of quasi-disorder and random disorder on many-body localization in this paper. First, we calculate the exctied-state fidelity to study the MBL phase transtion. By changing the form of the quasi-disorder, we study the MBL transition of the system with different forms of quasi-disorder and compare them with those of the random disordered system. The results show that both random disorder and quasi-disorder can cause the MBL phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains. In order to study the effect of spin interactions, we compare Ising spin-1 chains and spin-1/2 chains with the next-nearest-neighbour(N-N) two-body interactions and the next-next-nearest-neighbour (N-N-N)interactions. The results show that the critical point increases with the addition of the interaction. Then we study the dynamical properties of the model by the dynamical behavior of diagonal entropy (DE), local magnetization and the time evolution of fidelity to further prove the occurrence of MBL phase transition in the disordered Ising spin-1 chains with the (N-N) coupling term and distinguish the ergodic phase (thermal phase) and the many-body localized phase. Lastly, we delve into the impact of periodic driving on one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains. And we compare it with the results obtained from the Ising spin-1/2 chains. It shows that periodic driving can cause Ising spin-1 chains and Ising spin-1/2 chains to occur the MBL transition.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, a boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a fundamental challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>

      <title>Shear flow of non-Brownian rod-sphere mixtures near jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the discrete element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account, to unveil the shear rheology of suspensions of frictionless non-Brownian rods in the dense packing fraction regime. We find that, analogously to the random close packing volume fraction, the shear-driven jamming point of this system varies in a non-monotonic fashion as a function of the rod aspect ratio. The latter strongly influences how the addition of rod-like particles affects the rheological response of a suspension of frictionless non-Brownian spheres to an external shear flow. At fixed values of the total (rods plus spheres) packing fraction, the viscosity of the suspension is reduced by the addition of "short" ( $\leq 2$) rods but is instead increased by the addition of "long" ( $\geq2$) rods. A mechanistic interpretation is provided in terms of packing and excluded-volume arguments.</description>

      <title>Nature of the Volcano Transition in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly coupled phase oscillators may synchronize into disordered patterns of collective motion. We analyze this transition in a large, fully connected Kuramoto model with symmetric but otherwise independent random interactions. Using the dynamical cavity method we reduce the dynamics to a stochastic single-oscillator problem with self-consistent correlation and response functions that we study analytically and numerically. We clarify the nature of the volcano transition and elucidate its relation to the existence of an oscillator glass phase.</description>
