      <title>Simulating Ionized States in Realistic Chemical Environments With Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory and Polarizable Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical simulations of electron detachment processes are vital for understanding chemical redox reactions, semiconductor and electrochemical properties, and high-energy radiation damage. However, accurate calculations of ionized electronic states are very challenging due to their open-shell nature, importance of electron correlation effects, and strong interactions with chemical environment. In this work, we present an efficient approach based on algebraic diagrammatic construction theory with polarizable embedding that allows to accurately simulate ionized electronic states in condensed-phase or biochemical environments (PE-IP-ADC). We showcase the capabilities of PE-IP-ADC by computing the vertical ionization energy (VIE) of thymine molecule solvated in bulk water. Our results show that the second- and third-order PE-IP-ADC methods combined with the basis of set of triple-zeta quality yield a solvent-induced shift in VIE of -0.92 and -0.94 eV, respectively, in an excellent agreement with experimental estimate of -0.9 eV. This work demonstrates the power of PE-IP-ADC approach for simulating charged electronic states in realistic chemical environments and motivates its further development.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemical and Trajectory Surface Hopping Molecular Dynamics Study of Iodine-based BODIPY Photosensitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) was conducted to investigate its photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer for singlet oxygen generation. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods were used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) in a model monoiodinated BODIPY molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference ADC(2) method.
  Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) was tested against ADC(2) using different exchange-correlation functionals, employing a two-component pseudopotential basis set for iodine. SOC magnitudes between excited states were discussed using the Slater-Condon rules. The geometry dependence of SOCs for the lowest states was also examined.
  TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP were selected for subsequent absorption spectra and trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two bright states were identified in I-BODIPY's visible spectrum, showing a red shift due to iodine substitution. Excited-state MD simulations, including nonadiabatic effects and SOCs, were performed to investigate relaxation after photoexcitation to the S1 state.
  TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a similar timescale to internal conversions. After triplet population growth, a "saturation" phase was reached with a triplet-to-singlet ratio of about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 agrees qualitatively with the experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved measurement of solvation entropy, interfacial transport and charge-transfer kinetics of practical lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of electrochemical energy storage systems requires probing the electrochemical properties at each layer and interface during cell operation. While traditional onboard and operando methods can measure impedance, voltage, or capacity, they lack spatial resolution to pinpoint the properties to specific layers and interfaces. In this work, we describe an approach of using thermal waves to measure entropy change, transport resistance, and charge-transfer resistance with depth resolution of a few microns within an electrochemical cell. We achieve this by relating heat generation at multiple harmonics of an AC current to electrochemical processes and leveraging frequency dependence of thermal penetration depth for spatial resolution. We name this frequency domain spectroscopy of the thermal signatures of the electrochemical processes measured at multiple harmonics of the alternating current as Multi-harmonic ElectroThermal Spectroscopy (METS). This technique enables isolation and measurement of solvation entropy at individual electrode-electrolyte interfaces from the first harmonic (1{\omega}) thermal signature and resolution of the overall interfacial impedance into charge-transfer and interface transport resistance components from the second harmonic (2{\omega}) thermal signature. From this, we also demonstrate an operando measurement of the growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at the lithium-electrolyte interface and show that two chemically similar electrodes can have significantly different interfacial transport resistance based on the preparation of the electrodes. Additionally, the method is not specific to lithium-ion chemistry and can therefore be generalized for all electrochemical systems of interest.</description>

      <title>Electron Phase Detection in Single Molecules by Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry has underpinned a century of discoveries, ranging from the disproval of the ether theory to the detection of gravitational waves, offering insights into wave dynamics with unrivalled precision through the measurement of phase relationships. In electronics, phase-sensitive measurements can probe the nature of transmissive topological and quantum states, but are only possible using complex device structures in magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate electronic interferometry in a single-molecule device through the study of non-equilibrium Fano resonances. We show the phase difference between an electronic orbital and a coupled Fabry-Perot resonance are tuneable through electric fields, and consequently it is possible to read out quantum information in the smallest devices, offering new avenues for the coherent manipulation down to single molecules.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Active-Orbital-Based and Adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) Approaches to Excited Electronic States: Application to Potential Cuts of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first study using active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches to describe excited electronic states. These CC($P$;$Q$) methodologies are applied, alongside their completely renormalized (CR) coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC counterparts, to recover the ground- and excited-state potential cuts of the water molecule along the O-H bond-breaking coordinate obtained in the parent CC/EOMCC calculations with a full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT/EOMCCSDT). We demonstrate that the active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches closely approximate the CCSDT/EOMCCSDT data using significantly reduced computational costs while improving the CR-CC and CR-EOMCC energetics in stretched regions of the O-H bond-breaking potentials.</description>

      <title>Constructing accurate machine-learned potentials and performing highly efficient atomistic simulations to predict structural and thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\text{Cu}_7\text{P}\text{S}_6$ compound has garnered significant attention due to its potential in thermoelectric applications. In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</description>

      <title>Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCx24): Bridging Experiments and Computational Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for low-cost, durable, and effective catalysts is essential for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide upcycling to help in the mitigation of climate change. Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical dataset of 836k neutral closed shell molecules with upto 5 heavy atoms from CNOFSiPSClBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset which comprehensively covers all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers that contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of $p$-block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. We have used density functional theory ($\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize the geometries of 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers consistent with 5,599 unique stoichiometries. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of all the energetically lowest conformers (10,793 molecules) with up to 4 heavy atoms. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange-correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV and molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (aka "alchemical potential"), Mulliken charges, and Kohn-Sham orbitals. Supervised machine learning (ML) models of atomization energies on the energetically lowest conformers for the 258k constitutional isomers indicate a significantly more challenging benchmark than the previously introduced QM9 dataset with none of our models reaching chemical accuracy. VQM24 represents an accurate and unbiased benchmark dataset ideal for assessing the efficiency, accuracy and transferability of quantum ML models of real systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Transferability in Coarse-Grained Force Fields using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-graining is a molecular modeling technique in which an atomistic system is represented in a simplified fashion that retains the most significant system features that contribute to a target output, while removing the degrees of freedom that are less relevant. This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.</description>

      <title>Operating a Multi-Level Molecular Dimer Switch through Precise Tip-Molecule Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling structural transitions between molecular configurations is crucial for advancing functional molecular electronics. While reversible switching of bistable two-state molecules has been achieved, creating molecular systems that can be controllably switched between multiple configurations often requires complex synthetic methods, presenting a much greater challenge. In this study, we showcase a straightforward yet effective strategy to create and control transitions between multiple molecular structural states by forming a surface-bound molecular dimer. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we induce and characterize the structural transitions of a pyrrolidine dimer on a Cu(100) surface. The intermolecular interactions open new energy transfer channels, enabling the excitation through pathways that were inaccessible in monomers. The occupation of different molecular states is highly sensitive to both the energy of the tunneling electrons and the interaction with the STM tip. By precisely adjusting the tip-molecule distance, we can select the most probable structural configuration based on sample bias, thereby achieving on-demand control of this molecular dimer switch. This work highlights an approach that leverages both intermolecular and molecule-environment interactions to create and control an artificially fabricated molecular device.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A simple $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model, modified from the Jaynes-Cummings model, is proposed and its various dynamic aspects are investigated theoretically. In this model, the formation and breaking processes of hydrogen bond are accompanied by the creation and annihilation of the thermal phonon of the medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. Rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation - Lindbladian. The probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bond depending on the parameters of the external environment, are obtained. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are discussed. Consideration is given to the effect of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipations on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipations. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipations have a slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bond, but the variation of the inflows significantly affects the formation of hydrogen bond. According to the findings, the dynamics of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological models in the future.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for thermochemical nonequilibrium gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01673</link>

Abstract: State-specific thermochemical collisional models are crucial to accurately describe the physics of systems involving nonequilibrium plasmas, but they are also computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale, multi-dimensional simulations. Historically, computational cost has been mitigated by using empirical and physics-based arguments to reduce the complexity of the governing equations. However, the resulting models are often inaccurate and they fail to capture the important features of the original physics. Additionally, the construction of these models is often impractical, as it requires extensive user supervision and time-consuming parameter tuning. In this paper, we address these issues through an easily-implementable and computationally-efficient model reduction pipeline based on the Petrov-Galerkin projection of the nonlinear kinetic equations. Our approach is justified by the observation that kinetic systems in thermal nonequilibrium tend to exhibit low-rank dynamics that rapidly drive the state towards a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear nature of the governing equations, we observe that the dynamics of these systems evolve on subspaces that can be accurately identified using the linearized equations about thermochemical equilibrium, which significantly reduce the cost associated with the construction of the model. The approach is demonstrated on a rovibrational collisional model for the O$_2$-O system, and a vibrational collisional model for the combined O$_2$-O and O$_2$-O$_2$ systems. Our method achieves high accuracy, with relative errors of less than 1% for macroscopic quantities (i.e., moments) and 10% for microscopic quantities (i.e., energy levels population), while also delivering excellent compression rates and speedups, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>
