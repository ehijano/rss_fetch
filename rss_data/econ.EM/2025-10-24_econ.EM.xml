      <title>A Multi-Layer Machine Learning and Econometric Pipeline for Forecasting Market Risk: Evidence from Cryptoasset Liquidity Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969; Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors (HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74 assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap, Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided in the artifact repository.</description>

      <title>Testing Most Influential Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify these \emph{most influential sets}, no formal theory exists to determine when their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence, replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine learning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Identification and Debiased Learning of Causal Effects with General Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning. Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job Training Partnership Act program.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the Distribution Function of the argmax of a Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain extremum estimators have asymptotic distributions that are non-Gaussian, yet characterizable as the distribution of the $\argmax$ of a Gaussian process. This paper presents high-level sufficient conditions under which such asymptotic distributions admit a continuous distribution function. The plausibility of the sufficient conditions is demonstrated by verifying them in three examples, namely maximum score estimation, empirical risk minimization, and threshold regression estimation. In turn, the continuity result buttresses several recently proposed inference procedures whose validity seems to require a result of the kind established herein. A notable feature of the high-level assumptions is that one of them is designed to enable us to employ the Cameron-Martin theorem. In a leading special case, the assumption in question is demonstrably weak and appears to be close to minimal.</description>

      <title>On the Wisdom of Crowds (of Economists)</title>

Abstract: We study the properties of macroeconomic survey forecast response averages as the number of survey respondents grows. Such averages are ``portfolios" of forecasts. We characterize the speed and pattern of the gains from diversification as a function of portfolio size (the number of survey respondents) in both (1) the key real-world data-based environment of the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters, and (2) the theoretical model-based environment of equicorrelated forecast errors. We proceed by proposing and comparing various direct and model-based ``crowd size signature plots", which summarize the forecasting performance of $k$-average forecasts as a function of $k$, where $k$ is the number of forecasts in the average. We then estimate the equicorrelation model for growth and inflation forecast errors by choosing model parameters to minimize the divergence between direct and model-based signature plots. The results indicate near-perfect equicorrelation model fit for both growth and inflation, which we explicate by showing analytically that, under very weak conditions, the direct and fitted equicorrelation model-based signature plots are identical at a particular model parameter configuration. That parameter configuration immediately suggests an analytic closed-form estimator for the direct signature plot, so that equicorrelation ultimately emerges as a device for convenient calculation of direct signature plots, rather than a separate ``model" producing separate signature plots. In any event we find that the gains from survey diversification are greater for inflation forecasts than for growth forecasts, and that they are largely exhausted with inclusion of 5-10 representative forecasters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects as Continuous Functionals: Theory and Evidence from Healthcare Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I develop a continuous functional framework for spatial treatment effects grounded in Navier-Stokes partial differential equations. Rather than discrete treatment parameters, the framework characterizes treatment intensity as continuous functions $\tau(\mathbf{x}, t)$ over space-time, enabling rigorous analysis of boundary evolution, spatial gradients, and cumulative exposure. Empirical validation using 32,520 U.S. ZIP codes demonstrates exponential spatial decay for healthcare access ($\kappa = 0.002837$ per km, $R^2 = 0.0129$) with detectable boundaries at 37.1 km. The framework successfully diagnoses when scope conditions hold: positive decay parameters validate diffusion assumptions near hospitals, while negative parameters correctly signal urban confounding effects. Heterogeneity analysis reveals 2-13 $\times$ stronger distance effects for elderly populations and substantial education gradients. Model selection strongly favors logarithmic decay over exponential ($\Delta \text{AIC} &gt; 10,000$), representing a middle ground between exponential and power-law decay. Applications span environmental economics, banking, and healthcare policy. The continuous functional framework provides predictive capability ($d^*(t) = \xi^* \sqrt{t}$), parameter sensitivity ($\partial d^*/\partial \nu$), and diagnostic tests unavailable in traditional difference-in-differences approaches.</description>

      <title>Network Contagion Dynamics in European Banking: A Navier-Stokes Framework for Systemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for analyzing contagion dynamics in financial networks, extending the Navier-Stokes-based approach to network-structured spatial processes. We model financial distress propagation as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa = \sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\% reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system.</description>

      <title>Beating the Winner's Curse via Inference-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies to target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common approach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective value. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy has better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy evaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy optimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual improvements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by downstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy optimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream. Specifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also for the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than the observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize the Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals. Based on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that uses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in these predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can select the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy evaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.</description>
