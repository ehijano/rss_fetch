      <title>Towards a theory of eigenvalue asymptotics on infinite metric graphs: the case of diagonal combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine diagonal combs, a recently identified class of infinite metric graphs whose properties depend on one parameter. These graphs exhibit a fascinating regime where they possess infinite volume while maintaining purely discrete spectrum for the Neumann Laplacian. In this regime, we establish polynomial upper and lower bounds on the $k$-th eigenvalue, revealing that the eigenvalues grow at a rate strictly slower than quadratic. However, once the diagonal combs transition to finite volume, their growth accelerates to a quadratic rate. Our methodology involves employing spectral geometric principles tailored for metric graphs, complemented by deriving estimates for the $k$-th eigenvalue on compact metric graphs.</description>

      <title>A reverse Faber-Krahn inequality for the magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured B.~Helffer and S.~Fournais, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Floquet-Bloch functions on non-simply connected manifolds, the Aharonov-Bohm fluxes, and conformal invariants of immersed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral (Bloch) varieties of multidimensional differential operators on non-simply connected manifolds are defined. In their terms it is given a description of the analytical dependence of the spectra of magnetic Laplacians on non-simply connected manifolds on the values of the Aharonov-Bohm fluxes and a construction of analogues of spectral curves for two-dimensional Dirac operators on Riemann surfaces and, thereby, new conformal invariants of immersions of surfaces into 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Transverse Magnetic ENZ Resonators: Robustness and Optimal Shape Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain ``geometric-invariant resonant cavities'' introduced by Liberal et. al in a 2016 Nature Comm. paper, modeled using the transverse magnetic reduction of Maxwell's equations. The cross-section consists of a dielectric inclusion surrounded by an ``epsilon-near-zero'' (ENZ) shell. When the shell has the right area, its interaction with the inclusion produces a resonance. Mathematically, the resonance is a nontrivial solution of a 2D divergence-form Helmoltz equation $\nabla \cdot \left(\varepsilon^{-1}(x,\omega) \nabla u \right) + \omega^2 \mu u = 0$, where $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is the (complex-valued) dielectric permittivity, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the magnetic permeability, and a homogeneous Neumann condition is imposed at the outer boundary of the shell. This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, since $\varepsilon$ depends on $\omega$. Use of an ENZ material in the shell means that $\varepsilon(x,\omega)$ is nearly zero there, so the PDE is rather singular. Working with a Lorentz model for the dispersion of the ENZ material, we put the discussion of Liberal et.~al.~on a sound foundation by proving the existence of the anticipated resonance when the loss is sufficiently small. Our analysis is perturbative in character despite the apparently singular form of the PDE. While the existence of the resonance depends only on the area of the ENZ shell, the rate at which it decays depends on the shape of the shell. We consider an associated optimal design problem: what shape shell gives the slowest-decaying resonance? We prove that if the dielectric inclusion is a ball then the optimal shell is a concentric annulus. For an inclusion of any shape, we study a convex relaxation of the design problem using tools from convex duality, and discuss the conjecture that our relaxed problem amounts to considering homogenization-like limits of nearly optimal designs.</description>

      <title>On the Ginzburg-Landau Energy of Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a well known fact that the geometry of a superconducting sample influences the distribution of the surface superconductivity for strong applied magnetic fields. For instance, the presence of corners induces geometric terms described through effective models in sector-like regions. We study the connection between two effective models for the offset of superconductivity and for surface superconductivity introduced in \cite{BNF} and \cite{CG2}, respectively. We prove that the transition between the two models is continuous with respect to the magnetic field strength, and, as a byproduct, we deduce the existence of a minimizer at the threshold for both effective problems. Furthermore, as a consequence, we disprove a conjecture stated in \cite{CG2} concerning the dependence of the corner energy on the angle close to the threshold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Expander Mixing Lemma and its Converse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expander graphs are fundamental in both computer science and mathematics, with a wide array of applications. With quantum technology reshaping our world, quantum expanders have emerged, finding numerous uses in quantum information theory. The classical expander mixing lemma plays a central role in graph theory, offering essential insights into edge distribution within graphs and aiding in the analysis of diverse network properties and algorithms. This paper establishes the quantum analogue of the classical expander mixing lemma and its converse for quantum expanders.</description>

      <title>Beyond directed hypergraphs: heterogeneous hypergraphs and spectral centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of hypergraphs has received a lot of attention over the past few years, however up until recently there has been no interest in systems where higher order interactions are not undirected. In this article we introduce the notion of heterogeneous hypergraphs from an algebraic point of view, which have traditional directed hypergraphs as a particular case. We furthermore analytically study the spectral centralities associated to some types of heterogeneous hypergraphs, extending previously defined eigenvector-like centrality measures to this new realm. We supplement the analytical arguments with some numerical comparisons of pairwise and higher order rankings, and we construct directed higher order networks from real data.</description>

      <title>On singular pencils with commuting coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the spectrum of matrix (or operator) polynomials and the Taylor spectrum of its coefficients. We prove that the polynomial of commuting matrices is singular, i.e. its spectrum is the whole complex plane, if and only if (0, 0, ... , 0) belongs to the Taylor spectrum of its coefficients. On the other hand we prove that this equivalence is not longer true if we consider the operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert space as coefficients of polynomial. As a consequence we could propose a new description of (Taylor) spectrum of k-tuple of matrices and we could disprove the conjecture previously proposed in the literature. Additionally, we pointed out the Kronecker forms of the pencils with commuting coefficients.</description>

      <title>Pauli Hamiltonians with an Aharonov-Bohm Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>
