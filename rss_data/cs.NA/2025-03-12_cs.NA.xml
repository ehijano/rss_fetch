      <title>Joint State-Parameter Estimation for the Reduced Fracture Model via the United Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an effective United Filter method for jointly estimating the solution state and physical parameters in flow and transport problems within fractured porous media. Fluid flow and transport in fractured porous media are critical in subsurface hydrology, geophysics, and reservoir geomechanics. Reduced fracture models, which represent fractures as lower-dimensional interfaces, enable efficient multi-scale simulations. However, reduced fracture models also face accuracy challenges due to modeling errors and uncertainties in physical parameters such as permeability and fracture geometry. To address these challenges, we propose a United Filter method, which integrates the Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) for state estimation with the Direct Filter for parameter estimation. EnSF, based on a score-based diffusion model framework, produces ensemble representations of the state distribution without deep learning. Meanwhile, the Direct Filter, a recursive Bayesian inference method, estimates parameters directly from state observations. The United Filter combines these methods iteratively: EnSF estimates are used to refine parameter values, which are then fed back to improve state estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the United Filter method surpasses the state-of-the-art Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter, delivering more accurate state and parameter estimation for reduced fracture models. This framework also provides a robust and efficient solution for PDE-constrained inverse problems with uncertainties and sparse observations.</description>

      <title>An Improved Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Deflation Method for Multiple Solutions with Applications to Nonlinear Elliptic Equations in Varying Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple solutions are common in various non-convex problems arising from industrial and scientific computing. Nonetheless, understanding the nontrivial solutions' qualitative properties seems limited, partially due to the lack of efficient and reliable numerical methods. In this paper, we design a dedicated numerical method to explore these nontrivial solutions further. We first design an improved adaptive orthogonal basis deflation method by combining the adaptive orthogonal basis method with a bisection-deflation algorithm. We then apply the proposed new method to study the impact of domain changes on multiple solutions of certain nonlinear elliptic equations. When the domain varies from a circular disk to an elliptical disk, the corresponding functional value changes dramatically for some particular solutions, which indicates that these nontrivial solutions in the circular domain may become unstable in the elliptical domain. Moreover, several theoretical results on multiple solutions in existing literature are verified. For the nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation with parameter $\lambda$, nontrivial solutions are found for $\lambda &gt; \lambda_2$, here $\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the corresponding linear eigenvalue problem. For the singularly perturbed Ginzburg-Landau equation, highly concentrated solutions are numerically found which suggests that their convergent limit is a delta function when the perturbation parameter goes to zero</description>

      <title>A finite element model to analyze crack-tip fields in a transversely isotropic strain-limiting elastic solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a finite element model for the analysis of crack-tip fields in a transversely isotropic strain-limiting elastic body. A nonlinear constitutive relationship between stress and linearized strain characterizes the material response. This algebraically nonlinear relationship is critical as it mitigates the physically inconsistent strain singularities that arise at crack tips. These strain-limiting relationships ensure that strains remain bounded near the crack tip, representing a significant advancement in the formulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) within the context of first-order approximate constitutive models. For a transversely isotropic elastic material containing a crack, the equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum under a specified nonlinear constitutive relation, is shown to reduce to a second-order, vector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A robust numerical method is introduced, integrating Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin-type finite element procedure for spatial discretization. Numerical results, obtained for tensile loading conditions and two distinct material fiber orientations, illustrate that the evolution of crack-tip strains occurs significantly slower than that of the normalized stresses. However, the strain-energy density is most pronounced near the crack tip, consistent with observations from linearized elasticity theory. It is demonstrated that the framework investigated herein can serve as a basis for formulating physically meaningful and mathematically well-defined BVPs, which are essential for exploring crack evolution, damage, nucleation, and failure in anisotropic strain-limiting elastic materials.</description>

      <title>3D Surface Reconstruction and Volume Approximation via the meshless methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose several mathematical models for 3D surface reconstruction and volume estimation from a set of scattered cloud data. Three meshless methods including the interpolation-based method by RBF, PDE-based approach by Kansa's method and the Method of Fundamental Solutions are employed and compared. For the optimal recovery of the surfaces, the selection of free parameters in related PDE models are further studied and analyzed. Besides, several criteria like distance are employed in above methods instead of the classical parameter lambda determination strategy, which leads to a more reliable reconstruction performance. Finally, the volume estimation of 3D irregular objects is proposed based on the optimal reconstructed geometric models via proposed meshless methods. Numerous numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed surface reconstruction methods and the volume estimation strategy.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of lattice Boltzmann models with non-ideal equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed study of spectral properties and of linear stability is presented for a class of lattice Boltzmann models with a non-ideal equation of state. Examples include the van der Waals and the shallow water models. Both analytical and numerical approaches demonstrate that linear stability requires boundedness of propagation speeds of normal eigen-modes. The study provides a basis for the construction of unconditionally stable lattice Boltzmann models.</description>

      <title>A second-order accurate, positivity-preserving numerical scheme for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a second order accurate (in both time and space) numerical scheme for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system, which describes the ion electro-diffusion in fluids. In particular, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation is reformulated as a non-constant mobility gradient flow in the Energetic Variational Approach. The marker and cell finite difference method is chosen as the spatial discretization, which facilitates the analysis for the fluid part. In the temporal discretization, the mobility function is computed by a second order extrapolation formula for the sake of unique solvability analysis, while a modified Crank-Nicolson approximation is applied to the singular logarithmic nonlinear term. Nonlinear artificial regularization terms are added in the chemical potential part, so that the positivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved. Meanwhile, a second order accurate, semi-implicit approximation is applied to the convective term in the PNP evolutionary equation, and the fluid momentum equation is similarly computed. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided, based on the higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical solution, the rough and refined error estimate techniques. The following combined theoretical properties have been established for the second order accurate numerical method: (i) second order accuracy, (ii) unique solvability and positivity, (iii) total energy stability, and (iv) optimal rate convergence. A few numerical results are displayed to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic nonlinear stabilization for finite element approximation of Vlasov-Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a high-order finite element method for approximating the Vlasov-Poisson equations. This approach employs continuous Lagrange polynomials in space and explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for time discretization. To stabilize the numerical oscillations inherent in the scheme, a new anisotropic nonlinear artificial viscosity method is introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that this method achieves optimal convergence order with respect to both the polynomial space and time integration. The method is validated using classic benchmark problems for the Vlasov-Poisson equations, including Landau damping, two-stream instability, and bump-on-tail instability in a two-dimensional phase space.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze a general framework for space-time finite element methods that is based on least-squares finite element methods for solving a first-order reformulation of the thick parabolic obstacle problem. Discretizations based on simplicial and prismatic meshes are studied and we show a priori error estimates for both. Convergence rates are derived for sufficiently smooth solutions. Reliable a posteriori bounds are provided and used to steer an adaptive algorithm. Numerical experiments including a one-phase Stefan problem and an American option pricing problem are presented.</description>

      <title>A linear HDG scheme for the diffusion type Peterlin viscoelastic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear semi-implicit hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme is proposed to solve the diffusive Peterlin viscoelastic model, allowing the diffusion coefficient $\ep$ of the conformation tensor to be arbitrarily small. We investigate the well-posedness, stability, and error estimates of the scheme. In particular, we demonstrate that the $L^2$-norm error of the conformation tensor is independent of the reciprocal of $\ep$. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical convergence rates. Our numerical examples show that the HDG scheme performs better in preserving the positive definiteness of the conformation tensor compared to the ordinary finite element method (FEM).</description>

      <title>Fast and stable computation of highly oscillatory and/or exponentially decaying integrals using a Clenshaw-Curtis product-integration rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and implement a quadrature method for evaluating integrals of the form $\int_0^2 f(s)\exp(zs)\, {\rm d}s$, where $z$ is a complex number with a possibly large negative real part. The integrand may exhibit exponential decay, highly oscillatory behavior, or both simultaneously, making standard quadrature rules computationally expensive. Our approach is based on a Clenshaw-Curtis product-integration rule: the smooth part of the integrand is interpolated using a polynomial at Chebyshev nodes, and the resulting integral is computed exactly. We analyze the convergence of the method with respect to both the number of nodes and the parameter $z$. Additionally, we provide a stable and efficient implementation whose computational cost is essentially independent of $z$ and scales linearly with $L$. Notably, our approach avoids the use of special functions, enhancing its numerical robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Space-Variant Anisotropic Tikhonov Regularization for Full Waveform Inversion of Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging, ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem that requires robust regularization techniques to stabilize the solution and yield geologically meaningful results, especially when dealing with sparse data. Standard Tikhonov regularization, though commonly employed in FWI, applies uniform smoothing that often leads to oversmoothing of key geological features, as it fails to account for the underlying structural complexity of the subsurface. To overcome this limitation, we propose an FWI algorithm enhanced by a novel Tikhonov regularization technique involving a parametric regularizer, which is automatically optimized to apply directional space-variant smoothing. Specifically, the parameters defining the regularizer (orientation and anisotropy) are treated as additional unknowns in the objective function, allowing the algorithm to estimate them simultaneously with the model. We introduce an efficient numerical implementation for FWI with the proposed space-variant regularization. Numerical tests on sparse data demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness in reconstructing models with complex structures, significantly improving the inversion results compared to the standard Tikhonov regularization.</description>

      <title>Meshing method to build a centrosymmetric matrix to solve partial differential equations on an irreducible domain including a planar symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general method to generate a centrosymmetric matrix associated with the solving of partial differential equation (PDE) on an irreducible domain by means of a linear equation system is proposed. The method applies to any PDE for which both the domain to solve and the boundary condition (BC) type accept a planar symmetry, while no conditions are required on the BC values and the PDE right hand size function. It is applicable to finite element or finite difference method (FDM). It relies both on the specific construction of a mesh having a planar symmetry and a centrosymmetric numbering of the mesh nodes used to solve the PDE on the domain. The method is exemplified with a simple PDE using FDM. The method allows to reduce the numerical problem size to solve by a factor of two, decreasing as much the computing time and the need of computer memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new class of alternating-conjugate splitting methods is presented and analyzed. They are obtained by concatenating a given composition involving complex coefficients with the same composition but with the complex conjugate coefficients. We show that schemes of this type exhibit a good long time behavior when applied to linear unitary and linear Hamiltonian systems, in contrast with other methods based on complex coefficients, and study in detail their preservation properties. We also present new schemes within this class up to order 6 that exhibit a better efficiency than state-of-the-art splitting methods with real coefficients for some classes of problems.</description>

      <title>A Ritz method for solution of parametric generalized EVPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with approximate solution of generalized eigenvalue problem with coefficient matrix that is an affine function of d-parameters. The coefficient matrix is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and spectrally equivalent to an average matrix for all parameters in a given set. We develop a Ritz method for rapidly approximating the eigenvalues on the spectral interval of interest $(0,\Lambda)$ for given parameter value. The Ritz subspace is the same for all parameters and it is designed based on the observation that any eigenvector can be split into two components. The first component belongs to a subspace spanned by some eigenvectors of the average matrix. The second component is defined by a correction operator that is a d + 1 dimensional analytic function. We use this structure and build our Ritz subspace from eigenvectors of the average matrix and samples of the correction operator. The samples are evaluated at interpolation points related to a sparse polynomial interpolation method. We show that the resulting Ritz subspace can approximate eigenvectors of the original problem related to the spectral interval of interest with the same accuracy as the sparse polynomial interpolation approximates the correction operator. Bound for Ritz eigenvalue error follows from this and known results. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples. The advantage of our approach is that the analysis treats multiple eigenvalues and eigenvalue crossings that typically have posed technical challenges in similar works.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trilinos is a community-developed, open-source software framework that facilitates building large-scale, complex, multiscale, multiphysics simulation code bases for scientific and engineering problems. Since the Trilinos framework has undergone substantial changes to support new applications and new hardware architectures, this document is an update to ``An Overview of the Trilinos project'' by Heroux et al. (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 31(3):397-423, 2005). It describes the design of Trilinos, introduces its new organization in product areas, and highlights established and new features available in Trilinos. Particular focus is put on the modernized software stack based on the Kokkos ecosystem to deliver performance portability across heterogeneous hardware architectures. This paper also outlines the organization of the Trilinos community and the contribution model to help onboard interested users and contributors.</description>

      <title>Flexible and Efficient Probabilistic PDE Solvers through Gaussian Markov Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic knowledge about the physical world is virtually always expressed via partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in probabilistic PDE solvers -- Bayesian statistical models mostly based on Gaussian process (GP) priors which seamlessly combine empirical measurements and mechanistic knowledge. As such, they quantify uncertainties arising from e.g. noisy or missing data, unknown PDE parameters or discretization error by design. Prior work has established connections to classical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees. However, scaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge primarily due to dense covariance matrices. Our approach addresses the scalability issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP priors. It has been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) which when discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through sparse linear algebra. In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class to make probabilistic PDE solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear PDEs, through greatly accelerated inference mechanisms. Additionally, our approach also allows for flexible and physically meaningful priors beyond what can be modeled with covariance functions. Experiments confirm substantial speedups and accelerated convergence of our physics-informed priors in nonlinear settings.</description>

      <title>Construction of adaptive exponential multi-operator splitting methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct splitting methods suitable for the solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Due to the physical significance of the involved operators, splittings into three or even four operators with positive coefficients are appropriate for a physically correct and efficient solution of the equations. To efficiently obtain an accurate solution approximation, adaptive choice of the time-steps is important particularly in the light of the unsmooth dynamics of the system. Thus, we construct new method coefficients in conjunction with associated error estimators by optimizing the leading local error term. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that adaptive splitting faithfully reflects the solution behavior also in the presence of a shock-like behavior for the viscous Burgers equation, which serves as a simplified model problem displaying several features of the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible flow.</description>

      <title>A Neural Multigrid Solver for Helmholtz Equations with High Wavenumber and Heterogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning-enhanced multigrid solver for high-frequency and heterogeneous Helmholtz equations. By applying spectral analysis, we categorize the iteration error into characteristic and non-characteristic components. We eliminate the non-characteristic components by a multigrid wave cycle, which employs carefully selected smoothers on each grid. We diminish the characteristic components by a learned phase function and the approximate solution of an advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation, which is solved using another multigrid V-cycle on a coarser scale, referred to as the ADR cycle. The resulting solver, termed Wave-ADR-NS, enables the handling of error components with varying frequencies and overcomes constraints on the number of grid points per wavelength on coarse grids. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation using differentiable programming, making Wave-ADR-NS an end-to-end Helmholtz solver that incorporates parameters learned through a semi-supervised training. Wave-ADR-NS demonstrates robust generalization capabilities for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution velocity fields of varying difficulty. Comparative experiments with other multigrid methods validate its superior performance in solving heterogeneous 2D Helmholtz equations with wavenumbers exceeding 2000.</description>

      <title>An accelerated frequency-independent solver for oscillatory differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential equations arise in many scientific calculations. Because the running times of standard solvers increase linearly with frequency when they are applied to such problems, a variety of specialized methods, most of them quite complicated, have been proposed. Here, we point out that one of the simplest approaches not only works, but yields a scheme for solving oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential equations which is significantly faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our method, which operates by constructing a slowly varying phase function representing a basis of solutions of the differential equation, runs in time independent of the frequency and can be applied to second order equations whose solutions are oscillatory in some regions and slowly varying in others. In the high-frequency regime, our algorithm discretizes the nonlinear Riccati equation satisfied by the derivative of the phase function via a Chebyshev spectral collocation method and applies the Newton-Kantorovich method to the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations. We prove that the iterates converge quadratically to a nonoscillatory solution of the Riccati equation. The quadratic convergence of the Newton-Kantorovich method and the simple form of the linearized equations ensure that this procedure is extremely efficient. Our algorithm then extends the slowly varying phase function calculated in the high-frequency regime throughout the solution domain by solving a certain third order linear ordinary differential equation related to the Riccati equation. We describe the results of numerical experiments showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, including the modified Magnus method [18], the current state-of-the-art approach [7] and the recently introduced ARDC method [1].</description>

      <title>A finite element scheme for an optimal control problem on steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous finite element framework for solving an optimal control problem governed by the steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations, focusing on identifying a scalar permeability parameter $\gamma$ from local velocity observations. Three different finite element discretization schemes are proposed, and a priori error estimates are proven under appropriate regularity assumptions for each one. A key contribution of this paper is the development of residual-based a posteriori error estimators for both fully discrete and semi-discrete schemes, guiding adaptive mesh refinement to achieve comparable accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. The method of manufactured solutions is used for numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings, to demonstrate optimal convergence rates and the effectivity index is evaluated to measure their reliability. The framework offers insights into flow control mechanisms and paving the way for extensions to time-dependent, stochastic, or multiphysics problems.</description>

      <title>Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two approaches for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure: the inexact Lanczos method and inexact polynomial-filtered subspace iteration. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank polynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) stagnates.</description>

      <title>Complete Decomposition of Symmetric Tensors in Linear Time and Polylogarithmic Precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e. decompositions of the input symmetric tensor T of order 3 as sum of r 3rd-order tensor powers of u_i where u_i are vectors in \C^n. In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from the u_i. In this paper we assume that the u_i are linearly independent. This implies that r is at most n, i.e., the decomposition of T is undercomplete. We will moreover assume that r=n (we plan to extend this work to the case where r is strictly less than n in a forthcoming paper). We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem: given T, an accuracy parameter epsilon, and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors u'_i such that u_i and u'_i differ by at most epsilon (in the l_2 norm and up to permutation and multiplication by phases) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are: (1) We provide the first algorithm for this problem that works in the computation model of finite arithmetic and requires only poly-logarithmic (in n, B and 1/epsilon) many bits of precision. (2) Moreover, this is also the first algorithm that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. It requires O(n^3) arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters epsilon = 1/poly(n).</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver for Learning PDEs via Probabilistic Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05104v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines. The source code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/optray/MCNP.</description>

      <title>Undercomplete Decomposition of Symmetric Tensors in Linear Time, and Smoothed Analysis of the Condition Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the form $T = \sum_{i=1}^r u_i^{\otimes 3}$ where $T$ is a symmetric tensor of order 3 and $u_i \in \mathbb{C}^n$.In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from $u_i$. In this paper we assume that the $u_i$ are linearly independent.This implies $r \leq n$,that is, the decomposition of T is undercomplete.
  We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem in the exact arithmetic model of computation: Let $T$ be an order-3 symmetric tensor that has an undercomplete decomposition. Then given some $T'$ close to $T$, an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$, and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors $u'_i$ such that $||u_i - u'_i|| \leq \varepsilon$ (up to permutation and multiplication by cube roots of unity) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are:
  1) We provide the first algorithm for this problem that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. More specifically, it requires $O(n^3)$ arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters $\varepsilon =$ 1/poly(n) and B = poly(n).
  2) Our algorithm is robust, that is, it can handle inverse-quasi-polynomial noise (in $n$,B,$\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) in the input tensor.
  3) We present a smoothed analysis of the condition number of the tensor decomposition problem. This guarantees that the condition number is low with high probability and further shows that our algorithm runs in linear time, except for some rare badly conditioned inputs.
  Our main algorithm is a reduction to the complete case ($r=n$) treated in our previous work [Koiran,Saha,CIAC 2023]. For efficiency reasons we cannot use this algorithm as a blackbox. Instead, we show that it can be run on an implicitly represented tensor obtained from the input tensor by a change of basis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trajectory Inference in Wasserstein Space Using Consecutive Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing data from dynamic processes through cross-sectional measurements is seen in many fields, such as computational biology. Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a model for describing advection dynamics on distance-weighted directed graphs. To this end we establish a set of key properties, or axioms, that a discrete advection operator should satisfy, and prove that there exists an essentially unique operator satisfying all such properties. Both infinite and finite networks are considered, as well as possible variants and extensions. We illustrate the proposed model through examples, both analytical and numerical, and we describe an application to the simulation of a traffic network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>

      <title>On the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and convex reformulation in an inverse coefficient problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computer-assisted proof for the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and global reconstruction for the inverse Robin transmission problem, where the corrosion function on the boundary of an interior object is to be determined from electrode current-voltage measurements. We consider the shunt electrode model where, in contrast to the standard Neumann boundary condition, the applied electrical current is only partially known. The aim is to determine the corrosion coefficient with a finite number of measurements.
  In this paper, we present a numerically verifiable criterion that ensures unique solvability of the inverse problem, given a desired resolution. This allows us to explicitly determine the required number and position of the electrodes. Furthermore, we will present an error estimate for noisy data. By rewriting the problem as a convex optimization problem, our aim is to develop a globally convergent reconstruction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fast Inexact Bilevel Optimization for Analytical Deep Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical deep image prior (ADP) introduced by Dittmer et al. (2020) establishes a link between deep image priors and classical regularization theory via bilevel optimization. While this is an elegant construction, it involves expensive computations if the lower-level problem is to be solved accurately. To overcome this issue, we propose to use adaptive inexact bilevel optimization to solve ADP problems. We discuss an extension of a recent inexact bilevel method called the method of adaptive inexact descent of Salehi et al.(2024) to an infinite-dimensional setting required by the ADP framework. In our numerical experiments we demonstrate that the computational speed-up achieved by adaptive inexact bilevel optimization allows one to use ADP on larger-scale problems than in the previous literature, e.g. in deblurring of 2D color images.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.</description>
