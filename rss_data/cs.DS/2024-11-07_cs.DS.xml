      <title>Rapid Mixing at the Uniqueness Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, a fascinating computational phase transition has been identified in sampling from Gibbs distributions. Though, the computational complexity at the critical point remains poorly understood, as previous algorithmic and hardness results all required a constant slack from this threshold.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question at the critical phase transition threshold, thus completing the picture of the computational phase transition. We show that for the hardcore model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the uniqueness threshold $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$, the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by a polynomial in $n$, but is not nearly linear in the worst case.
  For the Ising model (either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic), we establish similar results. For the Ising model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the critical temperature $\beta$ where $|\beta| = \beta_c(\Delta)$, with the tree-uniqueness threshold $\beta_c(\Delta)$, we show that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by $\tilde{O}\left(n^{2 + O(1/\Delta)}\right)$ and lower bounded by $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ in the worst case. For the Ising model specified by a critical interaction matrix $J$ with $\left \lVert J \right \rVert_2=1$, we obtain an upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ for the mixing time, matching the lower bound $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ on the complete graph up to a logarithmic factor.
  Our mixing time upper bounds are derived from a new interpretation and analysis of the localization scheme method introduced by Chen and Eldan (2022), applied to the field dynamics for the hardcore model and the proximal sampler for the Ising model. As key steps in both our upper and lower bounds, we establish sub-linear upper and lower bounds for spectral independence at the critical point for worst-case instances.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Is All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal work of Bencz\'ur and Karger demonstrated cut sparsifiers of near-linear size, with several applications throughout theoretical computer science. Subsequent extensions have yielded sparsifiers for hypergraph cuts and more recently linear codes over Abelian groups. A decade ago, Kogan and Krauthgamer asked about the sparsifiability of arbitrary constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). For this question, a trivial lower bound is the size of a non-redundant CSP instance, which admits, for each constraint, an assignment satisfying only that constraint (so that no constraint can be dropped by the sparsifier). For graph cuts, spanning trees are non-redundant instances.
  Our main result is that redundant clauses are sufficient for sparsification: for any CSP predicate R, every unweighted instance of CSP(R) has a sparsifier of size at most its non-redundancy (up to polylog factors). For weighted instances, we similarly pin down the sparsifiability to the so-called chain length of the predicate. These results precisely determine the extent to which any CSP can be sparsified. A key technical ingredient in our work is a novel application of the entropy method from Gilmer's recent breakthrough on the union-closed sets conjecture.
  As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, a number of results in the non-redundancy literature immediately extend to CSP sparsification. We also contribute new techniques for understanding the non-redundancy of CSP predicates. In particular, we give an explicit family of predicates whose non-redundancy roughly corresponds to the structure of matching vector families in coding theory. By adapting methods from the matching vector codes literature, we are able to construct an explicit predicate whose non-redundancy lies between $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ and $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.6})$, the first example with a provably non-integral exponent.</description>

      <title>Learning Constant-Depth Circuits in Malicious Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal work of Linial, Mansour, and Nisan gave a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-depth circuits ($\mathsf{AC}^0$) with respect to the uniform distribution on the hypercube. Extending their algorithm to the setting of malicious noise, where both covariates and labels can be adversarially corrupted, has remained open. Here we achieve such a result, inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift. Our running time essentially matches their algorithm, which is known to be optimal assuming various cryptographic primitives.
  Our proof uses a simple outlier-removal method combined with Braverman's theorem for fooling constant-depth circuits. We attain the best possible dependence on the noise rate and succeed in the harshest possible noise model (i.e., contamination or so-called "nasty noise").</description>

      <title>Optimal prefix-suffix queries with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic border tree data structure [Gu, Farach, Beigel, SODA 1994] that answers the following prefix-suffix queries on a string $T$ of length $n$ over an integer alphabet $\Sigma=[0,\sigma)$: for any $i,j \in [0,n)$ return all occurrences of $T$ in $T[0\mathinner{.\,.} i]T[j\mathinner{.\,.} n-1]$. The border tree of $T$ can be constructed in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and answers prefix-suffix queries in $\mathcal{O}(\log n + \textsf{Occ})$ time, where $\textsf{Occ}$ is the number of occurrences of $T$ in $T[0\mathinner{.\,.} i]T[j\mathinner{.\,.} n-1]$. Our contribution here is the following. We present a completely different and remarkably simple data structure that can be constructed in the optimal $\mathcal{O}(n/\log_\sigma n)$ time and supports queries in the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. Our result is based on a new structural lemma that lets us encode the output of any query in constant time and space. We also show a new direct application of our result in pattern matching on node-labeled graphs.</description>

      <title>Safe Paths and Sequences for Scalable ILPs in RNA Transcript Assembly Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common step at the core of many RNA transcript assembly tools is to find a set of weighted paths that best explain the weights of a DAG. While such problems easily become NP-hard, scalable solvers exist only for a basic error-free version of this problem, namely minimally decomposing a network flow into weighted paths.
  The main result of this paper is to show that we can achieve speedups of two orders of magnitude also for path-finding problems in the realistic setting (i.e., the weights do not induce a flow). We obtain these by employing the safety information that is encoded in the graph structure inside Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solvers for these problems. We first characterize the paths that appear in all path covers of the DAG, generalizing a graph reduction commonly used in the error-free setting (e.g. by Kloster et al. [ALENEX~2018]). Secondly, following the work of Ma, Zheng and Kingsford [RECOMB 2021], we characterize the \emph{sequences} of arcs that appear in all path covers of the DAG.
  We experiment with a path-finding ILP model (least squares) and with a more recent and accurate one. We use a variety of datasets originally created by Shao and Kingsford [TCBB, 2017], as well as graphs built from sequencing reads by the state-of-the-art tool for long-read transcript discovery, IsoQuant [Prjibelski et al., Nat.~Biotechnology~2023]. The ILPs armed with safe paths or sequences exhibit significant speed-ups over the original ones. On graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range $50-160\times$ in the latter ILP model and in the range $100-1000\times$ in the least squares model.
  Our scaling techniques apply to any ILP whose solution paths are a path cover of the arcs of the DAG. As such, they can become a scalable building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, avoiding heuristic trade-offs currently needed on complex graphs.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. There has not been a unified formulation of hypergraphs, yet the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraphs can be formulated as EDVW hypergraphs without any information loss to the best of our knowledge. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to spectral graph theories, the formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and one result regarding hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is even incorrect. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of Both NCut and conductance. Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>$k$NN Attention Demystified: A Theoretical Exploration for Scalable Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their power, Transformers face challenges with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address this limitation, methods like $k$-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$NN) attention have been introduced [Roy, Saffar, Vaswani, Grangier, 2021] enabling each token to attend to only its $k$ closest tokens. While $k$NN attention has shown empirical success in making Transformers more efficient, its exact approximation guarantees have not been theoretically analyzed. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework for $k$NN attention, reformulating self-attention as expectations over softmax distributions and leveraging lazy Gumbel sampling [Mussmann, Levy, Ermon, 2017] with $k$NN indices for efficient approximation. Building on this framework, we also propose novel sub-quadratic algorithms that approximate self-attention gradients by leveraging efficient sampling techniques, such as Markov Chain-based estimation. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of these algorithms through empirical experiments, showcasing their benefits in both training and inference.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to quantum de Finetti theorems and SoS rounding via geometric quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs has become a common tool for algorithm design in theoretical computer science, including problems in quantum information. In this work we study a connection between a Hermitian version of the SoS hierarchy, related to the quantum de Finetti theorem, and geometric quantization of compact K\"ahler manifolds (such as complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^{d}$, the set of all pure states in a $(d + 1)$-dimensional Hilbert space). We show that previously known HSoS rounding algorithms can be recast as quantizing an objective function to obtain a finite-dimensional matrix, finding its top eigenvector, and then (possibly nonconstructively) rounding it by using a version of the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. Dually, we recover most known quantum de Finetti theorems by doing the same steps in the reverse order: a quantum state is first approximated by its Husimi distribution, and then quantized to obtain a separable state approximating the original one. In cases when there is a transitive group action on the manifold we give some new proofs of existing de Finetti theorems, as well as some applications including a new version of Renner's exponential de Finetti theorem proven using the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem, and hardness of approximation results and optimal degree-2 integrality gaps for the basic SDP relaxation of \textsc{Quantum Max-$d$-Cut} (for arbitrary $d$). We also describe how versions of these results can be proven when there is no transitive group action. In these cases we can deduce some error bounds for the HSoS hierarchy on complex projective varieties which are smooth.</description>

      <title>On the (Classical and Quantum) Fine-Grained Complexity of Log-Approximate CVP and Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a linear sized reduction from the Maximum Cut Problem (Max-Cut) with completeness $1 - \varepsilon$ and soundness $1 - \varepsilon^{1/2}$ to the $\gamma$-Approximate Closest Vector Problem under any finite $\ell_p$-norm including $p = 2$.
  This reduction implies two headline results: (i) We show that any sub-exponential time (classical or quantum) algorithm for the $o(\sqrt{\log n}^{\frac{1}{p}})$-Approximate Closest Vector Problem in any finite $\ell_p$-norm implies a faster than the state-of-the-art (by Arora, Barak, and Steurer [\textit{Journal of the ACM}, 2015]) sub-exponential time (classical or quantum) algorithm for Max-Cut. This fills the gap between the results by Bennett, Golovnev, and Stephens-Davidowitz [\textit{FOCS} 2017] which had an almost optimal runtime lower bound but a very small approximation factor and the results by Dinur, Kindler, Raz, and Safra [\textit{Combinatorica}, 2003] which had an almost optimal approximation factor but small runtime lower bound, albeit using a different underlying hard problem; (ii) in combination with the classical results of Aggarwal and Kumar [\textit{FOCS} 2023] and our quantization of those results, there are no fine-grained reductions from $k$-SAT to Max-Cut with one-sided error, nor are there non-adaptive fine-grained (classical or quantum) reductions with two-sided error, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses (or unless $\mathrm{NP} \subseteq \mathrm{pr} \text{-} \mathrm{QSZK}$ in the quantum case). The second result poses a significant barrier against proving the fine-grained complexity of Max-Cut using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (or the Quantum Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis).</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms and New Characterizations for CSP Sparsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CSP sparsification, introduced by Kogan and Krauthgamer (ITCS 2015), considers the following question: how much can an instance of a constraint satisfaction problem be sparsified (by retaining a reweighted subset of the constraints) while still roughly capturing the weight of constraints satisfied by {\em every} assignment. CSP sparsification captures as a special case several well-studied problems including graph cut-sparsification, hypergraph cut-sparsification, hypergraph XOR-sparsification, and corresponds to a general class of hypergraph sparsification problems where an arbitrary $0/1$-valued {\em splitting function} is used to define the notion of cutting a hyperedge (see, for instance, Veldt-Benson-Kleinberg SIAM Review 2022). The main question here is to understand, for a given constraint predicate $P:\Sigma^r \to \{0,1\}$ (where variables are assigned values in $\Sigma$), the smallest constant $c$ such that $\widetilde{O}(n^c)$ sized sparsifiers exist for every instance of a constraint satisfaction problem over $P$. A recent work of Khanna, Putterman and Sudan (SODA 2024) [KPS24] showed {\em existence} of near-linear size sparsifiers for new classes of CSPs. In this work (1) we significantly extend the class of CSPs for which nearly linear-size sparsifications can be shown to exist while also extending the scope to settings with non-linear-sized sparsifications; (2) we give a polynomial-time algorithm to extract such sparsifications for all the problems we study including the first efficient sparsification algorithms for the problems studied in [KPS24].</description>

      <title>Rounding Large Independent Sets on Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for approximating large independent sets when the input graph is a one-sided spectral expander - that is, the uniform random walk matrix of the graph has its second eigenvalue bounded away from 1. Consequently, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to find linear-sized independent sets in one-sided expanders that are almost $3$-colorable or are promised to contain an independent set of size $(1/2-\epsilon)n$. Our second result above can be refined to require only a weaker vertex expansion property with an efficient certificate. In a surprising contrast to our algorithmic result, we observe that the analogous task of finding a linear-sized independent set in almost $4$-colorable one-sided expanders (even when the second eigenvalue is $o_n(1)$) is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.
  All prior algorithms that beat the worst-case guarantees for this problem rely on bottom eigenspace enumeration techniques (following the classical spectral methods of Alon and Kahale) and require two-sided expansion, meaning a bounded number of negative eigenvalues of magnitude $\Omega(1)$. Such techniques naturally extend to almost $k$-colorable graphs for any constant $k$, in contrast to analogous guarantees on one-sided expanders, which are Unique Games-hard to achieve for $k \geq 4$.
  Our rounding builds on the method of simulating multiple samples from a pseudo-distribution introduced by Bafna et. al. for rounding Unique Games instances. The key to our analysis is a new clustering property of large independent sets in expanding graphs - every large independent set has a larger-than-expected intersection with some member of a small list - and its formalization in the low-degree sum-of-squares proof system.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>

Abstract: Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm [Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles. Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is encoded by a graph.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Lower Bounds for Approximaiton Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitivity measures how much the output of an algorithm changes, in terms of Hamming distance, when part of the input is modified. While approximation algorithms with low sensitivity have been developed for many problems, no sensitivity lower bounds were previously known for approximation algorithms. In this work, we establish the first polynomial lower bound on the sensitivity of (randomized) approximation algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) by adapting the probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) framework to preserve sensitivity lower bounds. From this, we derive polynomial sensitivity lower bounds for approximation algorithms for a variety of problems, including maximum clique, minimum vertex cover, and maximum cut.
  Given the connection between sensitivity and distributed algorithms, our sensitivity lower bounds also allow us to recover various round complexity lower bounds for distributed algorithms in the LOCAL model. Additionally, we present new lower bounds for distributed CSPs.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Metric Voting Distortion Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following well-studied problem of metric distortion in social choice. Suppose we have an election with $n$ voters and $m$ candidates located in a shared metric space. We would like to design a voting rule that chooses a candidate whose average distance to the voters is small. However, instead of having direct access to the distances in the metric space, the voting rule obtains, from each voter, a ranked list of the candidates in order of distance. Can we design a rule that regardless of the election instance and underlying metric space, chooses a candidate whose cost differs from the true optimum by only a small factor (known as the distortion)?
  A long line of work culminated in finding optimal deterministic voting rules with metric distortion $3$. However, for randomized voting rules, there is still a gap in our understanding: Even though the best lower bound is $2.112$, the best upper bound is still $3$, attained even by simple rules such as Random Dictatorship. Finding a randomized rule that guarantees distortion $3 - \epsilon$ has been a major challenge in computational social choice, as prevalent approaches to designing voting rules are known to be insufficient. Such a voting rule must use information beyond aggregate comparisons between pairs of candidates, and cannot only assign positive probability to candidates that are voters' top choices.
  In this work, we give a rule that guarantees distortion less than $2.753$. To do so we study a handful of voting rules that are new to the problem. One is Maximal Lotteries, a rule based on the Nash equilibrium of a natural zero-sum game which dates back to the 60's. The others are novel rules that can be thought of as hybrids of Random Dictatorship and the Copeland rule. Though none of these rules can beat distortion $3$ alone, a randomization between Maximal Lotteries and any of the novel rules can.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Iterative Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of nonlinear iterative algorithms which includes power iteration, belief propagation and approximate message passing, and many forms of gradient descent. When the input is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we use Boolean Fourier analysis to analyze these algorithms as low-degree polynomials in the entries of the input matrix. Each symmetrized Fourier character represents all monomials with a certain shape as specified by a small graph, which we call a Fourier diagram.
  We prove fundamental asymptotic properties of the Fourier diagrams: over the randomness of the input, all diagrams with cycles are negligible; the tree-shaped diagrams form a basis of asymptotically independent Gaussian vectors; and, when restricted to the trees, iterative algorithms exactly follow an idealized Gaussian dynamic. We use this to prove a state evolution formula, giving a "complete" asymptotic description of the algorithm's trajectory.
  The restriction to tree-shaped monomials mirrors the assumption of the cavity method, a 40-year-old non-rigorous technique in statistical physics which has served as one of the most important techniques in the field. We demonstrate how to implement cavity method derivations by 1) restricting the iteration to its tree approximation, and 2) observing that heuristic cavity method-type arguments hold rigorously on the simplified iteration. Our proofs use combinatorial arguments similar to the trace method from random matrix theory.
  Finally, we push the diagram analysis to a number of iterations that scales with the dimension $n$ of the input matrix, proving that the tree approximation still holds for a simple variant of power iteration all the way up to $n^{\Omega(1)}$ iterations.</description>

      <title>Testably Learning Polynomial Threshold Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rubinfeld &amp; Vasilyan recently introduced the framework of testable learning as an extension of the classical agnostic model. It relaxes distributional assumptions which are difficult to verify by conditions that can be checked efficiently by a tester. The tester has to accept whenever the data truly satisfies the original assumptions, and the learner has to succeed whenever the tester accepts. We focus on the setting where the tester has to accept standard Gaussian data. There, it is known that basic concept classes such as halfspaces can be learned testably with the same time complexity as in the (distribution-specific) agnostic model. In this work, we ask whether there is a price to pay for testably learning more complex concept classes. In particular, we consider polynomial threshold functions (PTFs), which naturally generalize halfspaces. We show that PTFs of arbitrary constant degree can be testably learned up to excess error $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ in time $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$. This qualitatively matches the best known guarantees in the agnostic model. Our results build on a connection between testable learning and fooling. In particular, we show that distributions that approximately match at least $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ moments of the standard Gaussian fool constant-degree PTFs (up to error $\varepsilon$). As a secondary result, we prove that a direct approach to show testable learning (without fooling), which was successfully used for halfspaces, cannot work for PTFs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a novel algorithm for computing a congruence on an inverse semigroup from a collection of generating pairs. This algorithm uses a myriad of techniques from computational group theory, automata, and the theory of inverse semigroups. An initial implementation of this algorithm outperforms existing implementations by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Practical, optimal preparation of general quantum state with exponentially improved robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>
