      <title>A modern Fortran library for SU(3) coupling and recoupling coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ has applications in several branches of physics. Many of these applications depend on availability of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ coupling and recoupling coefficients. We have developed a modern Fortran library for calculation of the coupling coefficients, for both the $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group chains, and the recoupling coefficients. The library implements the algorithms of Draayer, Akiyama, and Millener, which are laid out in the paper. Performance of the library has been tested and compared to the Akiyama-Draayer (AD) library implementing the same algorithms as well as to a more recent implementation. Our library works for a larger range of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ quantum numbers and provides more accurate coupling coefficients with large quantum numbers than the AD library.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based Dimensionality Reduction for Accelerating the Solution of Nonlinear Time-Dependent PDEs: Transport in Porous Media with Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based models often involve large systems of parametrized partial differential equations, where design parameters control various properties. However, high-fidelity simulations of such systems on large domains or with high grid resolution can be computationally expensive for the accurate evaluation of a large number of parameters. Reduced-order modeling has emerged as a solution to reduce the dimensionality of such problems. This work focuses on a nonlinear compression technique using a convolutional autoencoder for accelerating the solution of transport in porous media problems. The model demonstrates successful training, achieving a mean square error (MSE) on the order of \num{1e-3} for the validation data. For an unseen parameter set, the model exhibits mixed performance; it achieves acceptable accuracy for larger time steps but shows lower performance for earlier times. This issue could potentially be resolved by fine-tuning the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method for multi-scale phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 7 decades, the classical Monte Carlo method has played a huge role in the fields of rarefied gas flow and micro/nano scale heat transfer, but it also has shortcomings: the time step and cell size are limited by the relaxation time and mean free path, making it difficult to efficiently simulate multi-scale heat and mass transfer problems from the ballistic to diffusion limit. To overcome this drawback, a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is developed for solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in all regimes covering both ballistic and diffusive limits. This method is built upon the space-time coupled evolution model of the phonon BTE, which provides the framework for constructing a multi-scale flux at the cell interfaces. At the same time, in order to capture non-equilibrium transport efficiently, the multi-scale flux comprises two distinct components: a deterministic part for capturing the near-equilibrium or diffusive transport and a statistical particle part for recovering non-equilibrium or ballistic transport phenomena. The UGKWP method exhibits remarkable multi-scale adaptability and versatility, seamlessly bridging the gap between the diffusive and ballistic transport phenomena. In the diffusive limit, the present method naturally converges to the Fourier's law, with the diminishing particle contribution, whereas in the ballistic limit, the non-equilibrium flux is fully described by the free-streaming particles. This inherent adaptability not only allows for precise capturing of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium heat transfer processes but also guarantees that the model adheres strictly to the underlying physical laws in each phonon transport regime.</description>

      <title>Atomic Confinement Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the development of reusable software for computational chemistry [Lehtola, J. Chem. Phys. 159, 180901 (2023)], we aim to establish novel open source infrastructure for calculations with numerical atomic orbital (NAO) basis sets. Soft confinement potentials are typically used in this context to force the NAO radial basis functions {\psi}nl (r) to vanish smoothly in increasing r and to generate localized unoccupied states; we review such potentials in this work as a follow-up to our recent study on hard-wall confinement [{\AA}str\"om and Lehtola, J. Phys. Chem. A 129, 2791 (2025)]. We also note that in addition to their use in NAO generation, confinement potentials are also employed to simulate environmental effects in other research areas, such as studies of (i) atoms in solids, (ii) quantum dots, and (iii) high-pressure chemistry.
  As in our earlier work, we perform fully numerical density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional, and employ spherically averaged, spin-restricted densities, as is usual in NAO studies. Our calculations employ the HelFEM program, which implements the finite element method (FEM), yielding variational energies and enabling the use of various boundary conditions.
  We consider four families of potentials to study the Mg and Ca atoms, which are textbook examples of extended electronic structures. We show that the resulting ground-state orbitals are surprisingly insensitive to the employed form of the confinement potential, and that the orbitals decay quickly under confinement. We study increasingly steep potentials and point out how they approach the hard-wall limit in a systematic and smooth manner. Finally, we assess NAO basis set truncation errors arising from various parameter choices for the singular potentials that are now broadly used in the NAO literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scotogenic Parameter Spaces and Mapping Uncharted Dark Matter Phenomenology with Multi-Objective Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel artificial intelligence approach to explore beyond Standard Model parameter spaces by leveraging a multi-objective optimisation algorithm. We apply this methodology to a non-minimal scotogenic model which is constrained by Higgs mass, anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, dark matter relic density, dark matter direct detection, neutrino masses and mixing, and lepton flavour violating processes. Our results successfully expand on the phenomenological realisations presented in previous work. We compare between multi- and single-objective algorithms and we observe more phenomenologically diverse solutions and an improved search capacity coming from the former. We use novelty detection to further explore sparsely populated regions of phenomenological interest. These results suggest a powerful search strategy that combines the global exploration of multi-objective optimisation with the exploitation of single-objective optimisation.</description>

      <title>Predictive Digital Twins with Quantified Uncertainty for Patient-Specific Decision Making in Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in predictive models is critical for establishing trust and enabling risk-informed decision making for personalized medicine. In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data.</description>

      <title>SpectraMatcher: A Python Program for Interactive Analysis and Peak Assignment of Vibronic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SpectraMatcher is a cross-platform desktop application for interactive comparison of experimental and computed vibronic spectra, designed to assist in the recognition and assignment of spectral patterns. It provides an intuitive graphical interface -- with no coding or scripting required -- for importing experimental spectra, visualizing them alongside the corresponding theoretical spectra constructed from Gaussian frequency calculations, and adjusting key parameters such as peak width, intensity scaling factors, and vibration-type-specific anharmonic corrections. SpectraMatcher features an automated peak-matching algorithm that assigns experimental and computed peaks based on their intensity ratio and proximity. Assignments and spectra can be exported in multiple formats for publication or for further analysis. The software remains responsive even for large datasets, and supports efficient and reproducible interpretation of vibronic spectra.</description>

      <title>DIALECT, a software package for exciton spectra and dynamics in large molecular assemblies from weak to strong light-matter coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The software package DIALECT is introduced, which provides the capability of calculating excited-state properties and nonadiabatic dynamics of large molecular systems and can be applied to simulate energy and charge-transfer processes in molecular materials. To this end, we employ the FMO-LC-TDDFTB methodology, which combines the use of the fragment molecular orbital approach with the density-functional tight-binding method and an excitonic Hamiltonian including local and charge-transfer excitations. In this work, we present the features and capabilities of the DIALECT software package in simulating the excited state dynamics of molecules and molecular aggregates using exemplary trajectory surface hopping as well as decoherence corrected Ehrenfest dynamics calculations in the framework of LC-TDDFTB and FMO-LC-TDDFTB. In addition, the capability of simulating the polaritonic excited state properties is highlighted by the calculation of the polariton dispersion of an aggregate of naphthalene molecules. The development of the DIALECT program will facilitate the investigation of exciton and charge transport in large and complex molecular systems, such as biological aggregates, nanomaterials and other complex organic molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual splitting methods for phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfactants have important effects on the dynamics of droplets on solid surfaces, which has inspired many industrial applications. Phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines (PFS-MCL) has been employed to investigate the complex droplet dynamics with surfactants, while its numerical simulation remains challenging due to the coupling of gradient flows with respect to transport distances involving nonlinear and degenerate mobilities. We propose a novel structure-preserving variational scheme for PFS-MCL model with the dynamic boundary condition based on the minimizing movement scheme and optimal transport theory for Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed scheme consists of a series of convex minimization problems and can be efficiently solved by our proposed primal-dual splitting method and its accelerated versions. By respecting the underlying PDE's variational structure with respect to the transport distance, the proposed scheme is proved to inherits the desirable properties including original energy dissipation, bound-preserving, and mass conservation. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme and investigate the effects of surfactants on the droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>TorchGDM: A GPU-Accelerated Python Toolkit for Multi-Scale Electromagnetic Scattering with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensors. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 100 trillion grid points via information geometric regularization and the MFC flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).</description>

      <title>A bound state attractor in optical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the nonintegrable dynamics of coherent, solitonic, nonlinear waves, in a spatially nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation relevant to realistic modelling of optical systems: the Schrodinger-Helmholtz equation. We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from a variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the (integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure is a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose amplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons periodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from a state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into the system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a resonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary soliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially launched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when they collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of many initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a sequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from the weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both processes lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final state -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear waves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a more typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in previous literature.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed transformer neural operator for learning generalized solutions of initial boundary value problems</title>

Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points.

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Computational Magnetohydrodynamics with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the AGATE simulation code, a Python-based framework developed primarily for solving the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations while maintaining adaptability to other equation sets. The code employs a modular, object-oriented architecture that separates interface specifications from numerical implementations, allowing users to customize numerical methods and physics models. Built on a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme, AGATE currently supports the ideal, Hall, and Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) MHD equations, with multiple acceleration options ranging from Numpy to GPU-enabled computation via NVIDIA CUDA. Performance testing demonstrates that our GPU implementations achieve 40-60x speedups over CPU versions. Comprehensive validation through established benchmarks confirms accurate reproduction of both linear and nonlinear phenomena across different MHD regimes. This combination of modularity, performance, and extensibility makes AGATE suitable for multiple applications: from rapid prototyping to production simulations, and from numerical algorithm development to physics education.</description>
