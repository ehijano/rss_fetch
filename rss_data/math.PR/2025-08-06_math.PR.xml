      <title>Long time behavior and Yaglom limit for real trait-structured Birth and Death Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the long time behaviour of measure-valued birth and death processes in continuous time, where the dynamics between jumps are one-dimensional Markov processes including diffusion and jumps. We consider the three regimes, critical, subcritical and supercritical. Under suitable hypotheses on the Feynman-Kac semigroup, we prove a new recurrence for the moments and the extinction probability, their time asymptotics and the convergence in law for the measure-valued birth and death process conditioned to non extinction, leading to the existence of Q-process and Yaglom limit (in this infinite dimensional setting). We develop three classes of natural examples where our results apply.</description>

      <title>Matrix Rosenthal and Concentration Inequalities for Markov Chains with Applications in Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study moment and concentration inequalities of the spectral norm for sums of dependent random matrices.
  We establish novel Rosenthal-Burkholder inequalities for matrix martingales, as well as matrix Rosenthal, Hoeffding, and Bernstein inequalities for ergodic Markov chains.
  Compared with previous work on matrix concentration inequalities for Markov chains, our results do not require the assumptions of a non-zero absolute spectral gap and bounded matrix functions.
  Furthermore, our results have leading terms that match the Markov chain central limit theorem, rather than relying on variance proxies.
  We also give dimension-free versions of the inequalities, which are independent of the ambient dimension $d$ and relies on the effective rank of some matrix instead.
  This enables the generalization of our results to linear operators in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
  Our results have extensive applications in statistics and machine learning; in particular, we obtain improved bounds in covariance estimation and principal component analysis on Markovian data.</description>

      <title>Differential Shannon and R\'enyi entropies revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon entropy for discrete distributions is a fundamental and widely used concept, but its continuous analogue, known as differential entropy, lacks essential properties such as positivity and compatibility with the discrete case. In this paper, we analyze this incompatibility in detail and illustrate it through examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose modified versions of Shannon and R\'enyi entropy that retain key properties, including positivity, while remaining close to the classical forms. We also define compatible discrete functionals and study the behavior of the proposed entropies for the normal and exponential distributions.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>Local-global correlations of dynamics on disordered energy landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain generally arises from a complicated global balance of probability fluxes. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that the effective potential, defined as the negative logarithm of the stationary distribution, is often highly correlated with a simple local property of a state: the logarithm of its exit rate. To better understand why and how typically this correlation is high, we study reversible reaction kinetics on energy landscapes consisting of Gaussian wells and barriers, respectively associated with the vertices and edges of regular graphs. We find that for the correlation to be high it suffices for the heights of the barriers to vary significantly less than the depths of the wells, regardless of the degree of the underlying graph. As an application, we bound below the expected correlation exhibited by dynamics of the random energy model, known as the Bouchaud trap model. We anticipate that the proof, which combines a general lower bound of the expected correlation with the Gaussian concentration inequality, can be extended to several other classes of models.</description>

      <title>Coupled KPZ equations and their decoupleability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss characterizations of the decoupleability, partial and full, of trilinear or completely symmetric real $n\times n\times n$ tensors, which inform on the structure of certain coupled KPZ equations. Informally, when the tensor is partially decoupleable, one of the components in the coupled KPZ equation splits off from the others, while when the tensor is fully decoupleable, each of the $n$ components splits off from the others.
  Such a characterization is recast as a problem of membership of trilinear tensors in $O(n)$ orbits of subsets of fully decoupleable and partially decoupleable tensors. When $n=2$, we show these subsets are the same, and in this case give a single criterion in terms of the entries of a tensor for membership in the orbits of these subsets. When $n\geq 3$, the subsets are different. For $n\geq 3$, we characterize full decoupleability in terms of several abstract relations, which when $n=3$ are made explicit. When $n=3$, we also explicitly characterize partial decoupleability.
  The methods involve notions in applied invariant theory, relating $O(n)$ invariant subsets to stabilizer subgroup actions on smaller sets. When $n=3$ make use of the explicit basis of invariants found by Olive and Auffray. When $n=2$, we also supply two other more direct arguments.</description>

      <title>The probabilities for the number of intersections in the Buffon-Laplace needle problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, Stoka solved Buffon's needle problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 2$, i.e. he found a closed form solution for the probability that a line segment ("needle") with length $\ell$ intersects a grid of parallel hyperplanes with mutual distance $a\ge\ell$. For the Laplace needle problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where there are $d$ families of parallel hyperplanes with distances $a_1,\ldots,a_d$ fulfilling $\min(a_1,\ldots,a_d)\ge\ell$, and normal vectors in the direction of the coordinate axes $x_1,\ldots,x_d$, he was only able to give a closed solution for the case that the needle intersects hyperplanes of all families simultaneously. In the present paper, we calculate the probabilities $p_d(i)$ of exactly $i$, $0\le i\le d$, intersection points between the needle and the hyperrectangular grid formed by the $d$ families, and conclude the expected value and the variance for the number of intersection points. Furthermore, we present a simulation program and some numerical results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic universal moment matching properties of normal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to reduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for general integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of samples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given underlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed for a general integration problem $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment matching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary condition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal distribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for efficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment matching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of simulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar to variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear moment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Computable Bounds for Strong Approximations with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koml\'os$\unicode{x2013}$Major$\unicode{x2013}$Tusn\'ady (KMT) inequality for partial sums is one of the most celebrated results in probability theory. Yet its practical application is hindered by its dependence on unknown constants. This paper addresses this limitation for bounded i.i.d. random variables. At the cost of an additional logarithmic factor, we propose a computable version of the KMT inequality that depends only on the variables' range and standard deviation. We also derive an empirical version of the inequality that achieves nominal coverage even when the standard deviation is unknown. We then demonstrate the practicality of our bounds through applications to online change point detection and first hitting time probabilities.</description>

      <title>The separation modulus of unitarily invariant matrix norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $X=(M_n(\mathbb{R}),\|\cdot\|)$ is a unitarily invariant normed space on , then we prove (via exact computations for a Jacobi orthogonal random matrix ensemble) that the spectral gap of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit ball $B_X$ of $X$ satisfies $\lambda(X)\asymp n^3 \|I\|^2$. This leads to a confirmation of the weak isomorphic reverse isoperimetry conjecture for $X$, namely, we demonstrate that there exists a convex body $L=L_X\subset B_X$ such that $\mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(L)^{1/n^2}\asymp \mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(B_{X})^{1/n^2}$, yet its isoperimetric quotient is at most a universal constant multiple of $n$. As a corollary (and motivation) of these results, we deduce that the separation modulus of $X$ satisfies $\mathsf{SEP}(X)\asymp \sqrt{n}\|I_n\|_X\mathrm{diam}(B_X)$, where $\mathrm{diam}(B_X)$ is the diameter of $B_X$ with respect to the standard Euclidean metric on $M_n(\mathbb{R})$. Assuming oracle access to norm evaluations in $X$, by combining this with a new deterministic algorithm for efficiently computing a $O(1)$-approximation of the diameter of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are given by a weak membership oracle and are symmetric with respect to coordinate permutations and reflections about the axes, we obtain an oracle polynomial time algorithm whose output is guaranteed to be the separation modulus of $X$ up to positive universal constant factors. We also deduce an upper bound on the Lipschitz extension modulus of $X$ that improves over the previously best-known bound even in the special case when $X$ is $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ equipped with the $\ell_{2}^n\to \ell_{2}^n$ operator norm.</description>

      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we consider a new notion of affine spectral-independence in designing random walks. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancy across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancy at any point during the process. This technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The fermionic DGFF and its scaling limit logCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify the scaling limit of the fermionic discrete Gaussian free field (fDGFF) as a logarithmic conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions. We first establish a one-to-one correspondence between the space of local observables of the fDGFF and the space of local fields of the symplectic fermions CFT, a logarithmic CFT with central charge $c = - 2$. This correspondence is meaningful in the sense that, when appropriately renormalised, the fDGFF correlation functions converge to corresponding CFT correlation functions in the scaling limit. As an application to these results, we interpret (the scaling limit of) certain local observables in the uniform spanning tree and the Abelian sandpile model as local fields of the symplectic fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distribution over instances of a sampling problem is said to exhibit transport disorder chaos if perturbing the instance by a small amount of random noise dramatically changes the stationary distribution (in Wasserstein distance). Seeking to provide evidence that some sampling tasks are hard on average, a recent line of work has demonstrated that disorder chaos is sufficient to rule out "stable" sampling algorithms, such as gradient methods and some diffusion processes.
  We demonstrate that disorder chaos does not preclude polynomial-time sampling by canonical algorithms in canonical models. We show that with high probability over a random graph $\boldsymbol{G} \sim G(n,1/2)$: (1) the hardcore model (at fugacity $\lambda = 1$) on $\boldsymbol{G}$ exhibits disorder chaos, and (2) Glauber dynamics run for $O(n)$ time can approximately sample from the hardcore model on $\boldsymbol{G}$ (in Wasserstein distance).</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the real eigenvalue distribution for the real spherical ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real Ginibre spherical ensemble consists of random matrices of the form $A B^{-1}$, where $A,B$ are independent standard real Gaussian $N \times N$ matrices. The expected number of real eigenvalues is known to be of order $\sqrt{N}$. We consider the probability $p_{N.M}^{\rm r}$ that there are $M$ real eigenvalues in various regimes. These are when $M$ is proportional to $N$ (large deviations), when $N$ is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ (intermediate deviations), and when $M$ is in the neighbourhood of the mean (local central limit theorem). This is done using a Coulomb gas formalism in the large deviations case, and by determining the leading asymptotic form of the generating function for the probabilities in the case of intermediate deviations (the local central limit regime was known from earlier work). Moreover a matching of the left tail asymptotics of the intermediate deviation regime with that of the right tail of the large deviation regime is exhibited, as is a matching of the right tail intermediate deviation regime with the leading order form of the probabilities in the local central limit regime. We also give the leading asymptotic form of $p_{N,0}^{\rm r}$, i.e. the probability of no real eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.</description>

      <title>Assortativity in geometric and scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assortative behavior of a network is the tendency of similar (or dissimilar) nodes to connect to each other. This tendency can have an influence on various properties of the network, such as its robustness or the dynamics of spreading processes. In this paper, we study degree assortativity both in real-world networks and in several generative models for networks with heavy-tailed degree distribution based on latent spaces. In particular, we study Chung-Lu Graphs and Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs).
  Previous research on assortativity has primarily focused on measuring the degree assortativity in real-world networks using the Pearson assortativity coefficient, despite reservations against this coefficient. We rigorously confirm these reservations by mathematically proving that the Pearson assortativity coefficient does not measure assortativity in any network with sufficiently heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is typical for real-world networks. Moreover, we find that other single-valued assortativity coefficients also do not sufficiently capture the wiring preferences of nodes, which often vary greatly by node degree. We therefore take a more fine-grained approach, analyzing a wide range of conditional and joint weight and degree distributions of connected nodes, both numerically in real-world networks and mathematically in the generative graph models. We provide several methods of visualizing the results.
  We show that the generative models are assortativity-neutral, while many real-world networks are not. Therefore, we also propose an extension of the GIRG model which retains the manifold desirable properties induced by the degree distribution and the latent space, but also exhibits tunable assortativity. We analyze the resulting model mathematically, and give a fine-grained quantification of its assortativity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Pathwise Observables of Markov-Jump Processes: Unification of Diffusion and Jump Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-wise observables--functionals of stochastic trajectories--are at the heart of time-average statistical mechanics and are central to thermodynamic inequalities such as uncertainty relations, speed limits, and correlation-bounds. They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the typical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are experimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables have been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and Markov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the respective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a patchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic calculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise observables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump dynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with continuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise observables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a "Langevin equation" for jump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their covariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic inequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We determine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal) perturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete unification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the direction of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the learning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of stochastic partial differential equations with fully local monotone coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with fully local monotone coefficients in a Gelfand triple $V\subseteq H \subseteq V^*$: \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} dX(t) &amp; = A(t,X(t))dt + B(t,X(t))dW(t), \quad t\in (0,T], X(0) &amp; = x\in H, \end{aligned} \right. \end{align*} where \begin{align*} A: [0,T]\times V \rightarrow V^* , \quad B: [0,T]\times V \rightarrow L_2(U,H) \end{align*} are measurable maps, $L_2(U,H)$ is the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators from $U$ to $H$ and $W$ is a $U$-cylindrical Wiener process. Such SPDEs include many interesting models in applied fields like fluid dynamics etc. In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of the above SPDEs under fully local monotonicity condition solving a longstanding open problem. The conditions on the diffusion coefficient $B(t,\cdot)$ are allowed to depend on both the $H$-norm and $V$-norm. In the case of classical SPDEs, this means that $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ could also depend on the gradient of the solution. The well-posedness is obtained through a combination of pseudo-monotonicity techniques and compactness arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of dissipative measure valued martingale solutions for stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. These solutions are weak from a probabilistic perspective, since they include both the driving Wiener process and the probability space as an integral part of the solution. Then, for the stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes system, we establish the relative energy inequality, and as a result, we demonstrate the path-wise weak-strong uniqueness principle. We also look at the inviscid-incompressible limit of the underlying system of equations using the relative energy inequality.</description>

Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semi-group of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semi-group of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the $\varepsilon$-Euler-Maruyama scheme for time-inhomogeneous jump-driven SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of general SDEs with a jump integral term driven by a time-inhomogeneous Poisson random measure. We propose a two-parameters Euler-type scheme for this SDE class and prove an optimal rate for the strong convergence with respect to the $L^p(\Omega)$-norm and for the weak convergence, considering integration over $n$ uniform time-steps. One of the primary issues to address in this context is the approximation of the noise structure when it can no longer be expressed as the increment of random variables. We extend the Asmussen-Rosi\'nski approach to the case of a fully dependent jump coefficient and time-dependent Poisson compensation, handling contribution of jumps smaller than $\varepsilon$ with an appropriate Gaussian substitute and exact simulation for the large jumps contribution.
  For any $p \geq 2$, under hypotheses required to control the $L^p$-moments of the process, we obtain a strong convergence rate of order $1/p$. Under standard regularity hypotheses on the coefficients, we obtain a weak convergence rate of $1/n+\varepsilon^{3-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the underlying L\'evy measure. We compare this scheme with the Rubenthaler's approach where the jumps smaller than $\varepsilon$ are neglected, providing strong and weak rates of convergence in that case too. The theoretical rates are confirmed by numerical experiments afterwards. We apply this model class for some anomalous diffusion model related to the dynamics of rigid fibres in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Counting minimal cutsets and $p_c&lt;1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

      <title>A new proof of superadditivity and of the density conjecture for Activated Random Walks on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two recent works, Hoffman, Johnson and Junge proved the density conjecture, the hockey stick conjecture and the ball conjecture for Activated Random Walks in dimension one, showing an equality between several different definitions of the critical density of the model. This establishes a kind of self-organized criticality, which was originally predicted for the Abelian Sandpile Model.
  Their proof uses a comparison with a percolation process, which exhibits superadditivity. We present here a different proof of these conjectures, based on a new superadditivity property that we establish directly for Activated Random Walks, without relying on a percolation process.
  This more elementary approach yields less precise bounds than the percolation technology developed by Hoffman, Johnson and Junge, but it might open new perspectives to go beyond the one-dimensional setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Voronoi percolation on a large class of $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, which includes the hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^d$, $d\geq 2$. We prove that as the intensity $\lambda$ of the underlying Poisson point process tends to infinity, both critical parameters $p_c(M,\lambda)$ and $p_u(M,\lambda)$ converge to the Euclidean critical parameter $p_c(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This extends a recent result of Hansen &amp; M\"uller in the special case $M=\mathbb{H}^2$ to a general class of manifolds of arbitrary dimension. A crucial step in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is to show that if $M$ is simply connected and one-ended, then embedded graphs induced by a general class of tessellations on $M$ have connected minimal cutsets. In particular, this result applies to $\varepsilon$-nets, allowing us to implement a "fine-graining" argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Germ order is a non-standard stochastic order defined through the comparison of the generating functions of the processes. This order was first introduced for branching random walks with a constant breeding law and independent dispersal of offspring, which are characterized by a one-dimensional generating function. In this work, we investigate the properties of the extension of this concept to processes characterized by a multidimensional generating function, such as general branching random walks and rumor processes. In particular, we use germ ordering to characterize the behavior of certain branching random walks and rumor processes with inhomogeneous breeding/transmitting laws.</description>

We show that this event is noise sensitive under Glauber dynamics $t \mapsto \sigma_t$ in the subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We rely on the non-spectral approach from our previous work [TV23]. An important aspect in this more general setup is the study of the pair $(\sigma_0,\sigma_t)$ and in particular the establishment of properties such as finite-energy and spatial mixing.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the following type of results about critical Bernoulli percolation in high dimensions: The collection of clusters that do contain large (self-avoiding) loops in a large box is tight. The collection of these large loops has scaling limits that one will be able to relate to Brownian loop-soups (each of these atypical loop-containing clusters does in some sense only contain one large self-avoiding loop in the sense that any two such loops will be very close). This feature contrasts with the known proliferation of "typical" percolation clusters (i.e., among the many large clusters in a given box, only a handful will contain a loop of size comparable to the box).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a statistically optimal approach for learning a function value using a confidence interval in a wide range of models, including general non-parametric estimation of an expected loss described as a stochastic programming problem or various SDE models. More precisely, we develop a systematic construction of highly accurate confidence intervals by using a moderate deviation principle-based approach. It is shown that the proposed confidence intervals are statistically optimal in the sense that they satisfy criteria regarding exponential accuracy, minimality, consistency, mischaracterization probability, and eventual uniformly most accurate (UMA) property. The confidence intervals suggested by this approach are expressed as solutions to robust optimization problems, where the uncertainty is expressed via the underlying moderate deviation rate function induced by the data-generating process. We demonstrate that for many models these optimization problems admit tractable reformulations as finite convex programs even when they are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>ALEA IACTA EST: A Declarative Domain-Specific Language for Manually Performable Random Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random experiments that are simple and clear enough to be performed by human agents feature prominently in the teaching of elementary stochastics as well as in games.  We present Alea, a domain-specific language for the specification of random experiments.  Alea code can either be analyzed statically to obtain and inspect probability distributions of outcomes, or be executed with a source pseudo-randomness for simulation or as a game assistant.  The language is intended for ease of use by non-expert programmers, in particular students of elementary stochastics, and players and designers of games of chance, by focusing on concepts common to functional programming and basic mathematics.  Both the design of the language and the implementation of runtime environments are work in progress.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of the bounded harmonic functions on a simply connected Riemannian manifold $\widetilde{M}$ without conjugate points, which can be compactified via the ideal boundary $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be a uniform visibility manifold which satisfy the Axiom $2$, or a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a cocompact discrete subgroup of $Iso(\widetilde{M})$, we show that for a given continuous function on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, there exists a harmonic extension to $\widetilde{M}$. And furthermore, when $\widetilde{M}$ is a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, the Brownian motion defines a family of harmonic measures $\nu_{\ast}$ on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, we show that $(\widetilde{M}(\infty),\nu_{\ast})$ is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Diffusive behavior of transport noise on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>

Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically transport noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>
