      <title>Unsupervised and probabilistic learning with Contrastive Local Learning Networks: The Restricted Kirchhoff Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous physical learning systems modify their internal parameters and solve computational tasks without relying on external computation. Compared to traditional computers, they enjoy distributed and energy-efficient learning due to their physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a self-learning resistor network, the Restricted Kirchhoff Machine, capable of solving unsupervised learning tasks akin to the Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm. The circuit relies on existing technology based on Contrastive Local Learning Networks, in which two identical networks compare different physical states to implement a contrastive local learning rule. We simulate the training of the machine on the binarized MNIST dataset, providing a proof of concept of its learning capabilities. Finally, we compare the scaling behavior of the time, power, and energy consumed per operation as more nodes are included in the machine to their Restricted Boltzmann Machine counterpart operated on CPU and GPU platforms.</description>

      <title>Improving Spectral Resolution from Real-time Evolution for Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of numerically simulated spectra using real-time evolution methods for strongly correlated systems is affected by both the length of simulation time and the system size, limiting resolution in both frequency and momentum. In this work, we propose a computationally cheap, linear autoregressive machine learning-based framework to extend short-time and distance results over a wider range. We demonstrate the proposed method to extend the lesser Green's function for both the Hubbard model and the much more computationally challenging Hubbard-extended Holstein model. This technique significantly improves both the frequency and momentum resolution of the single-particle removal spectrum $\mathcal{A}(k,\omega)$, allowing observation of otherwise obscured spectral features due to electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Driven Transitions between Area Law Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements have become valuable tools for stimulating or preparing quantum many-body states with non-trivial properties. Here, we introduce and examine a measurement-only circuit (the projective quantum Ising model with three-spin interactions) that involves three non-commuting projective measurements. This model features three distinct phases, separated by two critical lines. We utilize two entanglement measures (topological entanglement entropy and mutual information) to identify the phase boundaries and derive various critical exponents through scaling analysis. We establish a relationship between our model and a two-dimensional statistical model (bond percolation) within certain limits. We hope that our results will shed light on further studies using other measurement-only models.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>

      <title>Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>
