      <title>A Novel Numerical Algorithms Optimization Method with Machine Learning Frameworks: Application on Real-time Plasmas Equilibrium Reconstruction in EXL-50U Spherical Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes for the first time a novel optimization method for numerical algorithms, which takes advantages of machine learning frameworks PyTorch and TensorRT, leveraging their modularity, low development threshold, and automatic tuning characteristics to achieve a real-time plasmas reconstruction algorithm called PTEFIT as an application in tokamak-based controlled fusion that combines performance, flexibility, and usability. The algorithm has been deployed and routinely operated on the EXL-50U spherical tokamak, with an average inference time of only 0.268ms per time slice at $129\times 129$ resolution, and has successfully driven feedback control of the maximum radial position of plasmas and isoflux control. We believe that its design philosophy has sufficient potential to accelerate development and optimization in GPU parallel computing, and is expected to be extended to other numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Plasmoid formation via competing lower-hybrid drift and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities: A hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear formation of plasmoids in 2D low-beta current sheets through the interplay between the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.</description>

      <title>SPARC Tokamak Error Field Expectations and Physics-Based Correction Coil Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-axisymmetric magnetic field coils have been designed to provide efficient error field correction and suppress edge localized modes in SPARC - a compact high-field tokamak that is presently under construction at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. These designs utilize the Generalized Perturbed Equilibrium Code's (GPEC's) representation of the multi-modal, non-axisymmetric plasma response to optimize the geometric coupling between 3D coil arrays and the desired core or edge plasma response. Error field correction coils are designed to couple to the plasma-amplified kink that dominates the drive of core resonances. The maximum allowable error field is projected to SPARC using an empirical scaling that is consistent with linear and nonlinear MHD modeling expectations. Asymmetric construction and assembly tolerances are then balanced against the corresponding kA-turns needed for correction to levels below the allowable limit. These physics-driven coil designs provide confidence in our ability to operate SPARC in new high field tokamak regimes without error field induced locked modes.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Analysis Approach to Experiments in Z pinch Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical behavior of discharges in Z pinch devices can be completely deciphered in terms of only three dimensionless parameters. These parameters can be arranged in a way that draw a surface in 3D space. This surface compiles all the accessible information on the macroscopic physical behavior of each possible Z pinch discharge. We analyze the practical problems the drawing of this surface encounters and in view of the situation, we devote the remainder of the article to outline a feasible method for estimating the plasma temperature in Z pinch discharges.</description>

      <title>Oxygen atom density and kinetics in intermediate-pressure radiofrequency capacitively-coupled plasmas in pure O2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied radiofrequency capacitively coupled plasmas in pure O2 using single mode laser cavity ringdown spectroscopy of oxygen atoms at 630 nm. The absolute atom densities and translational temperatures were determined over a range of pressures and RF power . At pressures of 267 Pa and above, the O atom mole fraction increases with RF power and decreases with pressure, reaching a maximum of 15 percent. However, at 133 and 67 Pa it passes through a distinct maximum with power before decreasing significantly. The atom recombination processes are probed by time resolved measurements in the afterglow of pulse modulated plasmas. At 133 and 67 Pa the atom loss is dominated by surface recombination, and we see clear evidence that this rate is increased by energetic ion bombardment, in agreement with a study from Bill Graham group. This effect partially explains the observed decrease in dissociation at high RF power. The time-resolved results also allow the O negative ion density to be determined and indicate the creation of ozone in the afterglow. At 133 Pa, the trends with RF power of the O2 dissociation, O negative ion density and gas temperature suggest a transition at high power to a plasma mode with fewer high energy electrons. At higher pressures gas phase recombination mechanisms become dominant, however gas convection driven by gas cooling in the afterglow makes it complex to analyse the time-resolved data.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic ghosts in pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions of two weakly nonlinear, $a_0 \ll 1$, counter-propagating EM pulses in pair plasma leave behind a long-surviving collection of localized waves, {\it an electromagnetic ghost}. Waves are trapped (localized) by the random large density fluctuations created by the beat between the pulses. The process is similar to random plasma density grating and/or Anderson-like wave localization. Structures survive for long, mesoscale times, while the EM energy slowly bleeds through high density walls of the density trap. Large guide magnetic field, $\omega_B \geq $ few $\omega$, suppresses the formation of the ghosts.</description>

      <title>Learning time-dependent and integro-differential collision operators from plasma phase space data using differentiable simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional and stochastic wave-particle dynamics in plasmas far from equilibrium are complex, temporally evolving, stochastic processes which are challenging to model. In this work, we extend previous methods coupling differentiable kinetic simulators and plasma phase space diagnostics to learn collision operators that account for time-varying background distributions. We also introduce a more general integro-differentiable operator formulation to probe relevant terms in the collision operator. To validate the proposed methodology we use data generated by self-consistent electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations. We show that both approaches recover operators that can accurately reproduce the plasma phase space dynamics while being more accurate than estimates based on particle track statistics. These results further demonstrate the potential of using differentiable simulators to infer collision operators for scenarios where no closed form solution exists or deviations from existing theory are expected.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear approach of bi-Kappa distributed electrons with dynamic $\kappa$ parameter. EMEC instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $\kappa$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\kappa$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\kappa$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\perp/T_\parallel &gt; 1$ ($\parallel, \perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\kappa$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\kappa$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\kappa$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\kappa$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.</description>

      <title>Reduction of SAXS Signal due to Doppler Broadening Induced Loss of Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical study of how Doppler-induced spectral broadening in laser-heated plasmas degrades the coherence of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) signals, and show that the resulting loss of temporal coherence reduces the SAXS intensity. Applying this formalism to two benchmark geometries - single density steps (wires) and periodic gratings -- we obtain analytic estimates. For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Flux Surfaces with Quasi-Poloidal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-poloidal (QP) magnetic fields have desirable properties for confining plasma: no radial drift of guiding centres (with positive implications for neoclassical transport), zero Pfirsch-Schl\"uter current, a lower level of damping for poloidal flows, leading to reduced anomalous transport, and possible stability benefits. Despite their attractive properties, QP fields are not amenable to the near-axis expansion, a major theoretical tool for understanding toroidal fields. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for defining and understanding QP flux surfaces. This framework relies on a simplification that transforms the task of finding a quasi-poloidal flux surface from a 3D problem to a 2D problem. This simplification also applies to asymmetric magnetic mirrors with desirable properties. We sketch how this 2D problem can form the basis of an efficient optimisation problem for finding QP flux surfaces. We leverage this 2D problem for theoretical understanding: for instance, we identify one class of QP flux surfaces that are naturally flat mirrors (Velasco et al. 2023). The reduced model is validated against numerically optimised QP equilibria. We further utilise the reduced model to explain the prevalence of cusps, high mirror ratios, and narrow pinch points in these numerical equilibria.</description>

Abstract: The imaging platform developed at the High Energy Density - Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields (HED-HiBEF) instrument at the European XFEL and its applications to high energy density and fusion related research are presented. The platform combines the XFEL beam with the high-intensity short-pulse laser ReLaX and the high-energy nanosecond-pulse laser DiPOLE-100X. The spatial resolution is better than 500 nm and the temporal resolution of the order of 50 fs. We show examples of blast waves and converging cylindrical shocks in aluminium, resonant absorption measurements of specific charged states in copper with ReLaX and planar shocks in polystyrene material generated by DiPOLE-100X. We also discuss the possibilities introduced by combining this imaging platform with a kJ-class laser.</description>

      <title>Evidence of energy conversion in weakly collisional plasma during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intervals of enhanced turbulent fluctuations are typically less frequent within the magnetic cloud region of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We investigate two such intervals inside an ICME observed by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft on 8--9 June 2000 and characterize their associated wave populations. We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates of global hybrid-Vlasov simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12614v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid-Vlasov simulations resolve ion-kinetic effects for modeling the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, but even 5D (2D + 3V) simulations are computationally expensive. We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</description>

      <title>High Field Diamond Magnetometry Towards Tokamak Diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centres (NVC) in diamond have been widely used for near-dc magnetometry. The intrinsic properties of diamonds make them potential candidates for tokamak fusion power diagnostics, where radiation-hard magnetometers will be essential for efficient control. An NVC magnetometer placed in a tokamak will need to operate within a $\geq$ 1 T magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate fibre-coupled ensemble NVC optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetometry measurements at magnetic fields up to 1.2 T. Sensitivities of approximately 240 to 600 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ and 110 nT/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ are achieved in a (10-150) Hz frequency range, for non-degenerate and near-$\langle$111$\rangle$ field alignments respectively.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and its Application to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics: Comparison of Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.
  One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.
  Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian hydrodynamic reductions of one-dimensional Vlasov equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Hamiltonian fluid reductions of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our approach utilizes the hydrodynamic Poisson bracket framework, which allows us to systematically identify fundamental normal variables derived from the analysis of the Casimir invariants of the resulting Poisson bracket. This framework is then applied to analyze several well-established Hamiltonian closures of the onedimensional Vlasov equation, including the multi-delta distribution and the waterbag models. Our key finding is that all of these seemingly distinct closures consistently lead to the formulation of a unified form of parametric closures: When expressed in terms of the identified normal variables, the parameterization across all these closures is revealed to be polynomial and of the same degree. All these parametric closures are uniquely generated from one of the moments, called $\mu$2, a cubic polynomial in the normal variables. This result establishes a structural connection between these different physical models, offering a path toward a more unified and simplified description of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson dynamics through its reduced hydrodynamic forms with an arbitrary number of fluid variables.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas {(moderate, strong, and ultra-relativistic)} with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information {as quantitative evidence}. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially exciting many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonlinear Drift Waves: Limiting Cases and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general equation for drift waves is derived incorporating both nonlinear electron density perturbation and ion vorticity effects. It is emphasized that the well-known Hasegawa-Mima (HM) equation for drift waves [A. Hasegawa and K. Mima, Phys. Fluids 21, 87 (1978)] includes only the ion vorticity term and neglects nonlinear electron density contribution that naturally arises from the electrons Boltzmann response. If ion vorticity term is ignored, then the general nonlinear equation reduces to an equation which can give two-dimensional soliton solution under an appropriate coordinate transformation. Furthermore, under the assumption that the normalized electrostatic potential depends only on one spatial coordinate along the predominant propagation direction, i.e. $\Phi = \Phi(y)$, the equation reduces to one-dimensional KdV equation [H. Saleem, Phys. Plasmas 31, 112102 (2024)]. Conversely, if the nonlinear electron density term is artificially suppressed and a two-dimensional potential $\Phi = \Phi(x, y)$ is considered, the equation reduces to Hasegawa-Mima equation supporting dipolar vortex solution. Because the HM equation ignores nonlinear electron density term, it cannot support one- or two-dimensional soliton solutions. Finally, the limiting forms of the general nonlinear equation are also briefly discussed using the reductive perturbation method (RPM).</description>

      <title>Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates charge-neutral, large random density fluctuations $\delta n/n_0 \gg 1$, and corresponding fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$ (random plasma density grating). Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. {In the linear regime, the instability can be classified as Induced Brillouin Scattering; it is described by the parameter $\rho _L = \left( a_0 { \omega_{p}/ }{\omega}\right)^{2/3} \leq 1 $, related to the Pierce parameter of Free Electron Lasers. In the cold case, the growth rate is $\Gamma \approx \rho _{L} \omega$ ($a_0 $ is laser nonlinearity parameter, $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency, $\omega$ is the laser frequency). } Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread with $\Theta \equiv k_B T/(m_e c^2) \approx a_0^2$, restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. Time-variability of the resulting density structures does not suppress localization due to remaining corrections (not white noise). We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape effects on Schwinger vacuum pair production in super-Gaussian asymmetric electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape on electron-positron pair production in the presence of an external asymmetric super-Gaussian electric field by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. By varying the field asymmetry, the pulse shape from Gaussian to super-Gaussian, and the carrier envelope phase, we show the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs to exhibit extreme sensitivity to these field characteristics. The effects are also qualitatively explained by analyzing the turning-point structures within the WKB formalism. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates in the case of long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-top super-Gaussian laser profile, pair production is further facilitated. For certain field parameters, we demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Integrated Radiation-Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Magnetized Burning Plasmas. I. Magnetizing Ignition-Class Designs</title>

Abstract: Motivated by breakthroughs in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), first achieving ignition conditions in National Ignition Facility (NIF) shot N210808 and then laser energy breakeven in N221204, modeling efforts here investigate the effect of imposed magnetic fields on integrated hohlraum simulations of igniting systems. Previous NIF experiments have shown yield and hotspot temperature to increase in magnetized, gas-filled capsules in line with scalings. In this work, we use the 2D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Lasnex with a Livermore ICF common model. Simulations are tuned to closely approximate data from unmagnetized experiments. Investigated here is the effect of imposed axial fields of up to 100 T on the fusion output of high-performing ICF shots, specifically the record BigFoot shot N180128, and HYBRID-E shots N210808 and N221204. The main observed effect is an increase in the hotspot temperature due to magnetic insulation. Namely, electron heat flow is constrained perpendicular to the magnetic field and alpha trajectories transition to gyro-orbits, enhancing energy deposition. In addition, we investigate the impact of applied magnetic fields to future NIF designs, specifically an example Enhanced Yield Capability design with 3 MJ of laser energy as well as a high-\r{ho}R, low implosion velocity "Pushered Single Shell" design. In conclusion, magnetization with field strengths of 5-75 T is found to increase the burn-averaged ion temperature by 50% and the neutron yield by 2-12. Specifically, we see yield enhancement of at least 50% with only a 5-10 T applied magnetic field for N221204, while a 65 T field on N210808 with symmetrization gives an 8 increase in yield. This is all without further design optimization to best take advantage of an applied B field, which promises even greater improvements for designs tailored specifically towards magnetization.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $\rho_e$.</description>
