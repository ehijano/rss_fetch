      <title>Active Learning vs Traditional Lecturing in Introductory Mechanics: A Pooled Pass-Rate Benchmark Under Common Departmental Assessments from a Latin American Institutional Change Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving student success in introductory physics remains a persistent challenge despite substantial progress from research-based instructional practices. Evidence from the Latin American context remains limited, where resources for instructional change are often constrained. This study reports a transparent benchmark of student passing outcomes in \textit{Elementary Mechanics I} at a large public university in M\'exico, comparing sections using Active Learning (AL) with those using Traditional Lecturing (TL). The labels AL and TL are operational, referring to section-level implementations by individual instructors rather than standardized protocols. Using aggregated counts from coordinator reports and common departmental assessments -- written by a committee independent of instructional modality -- we estimated pooled student-level pass probabilities for the first and second midterm exams, the global exam, and the final mark. Modality differences are summarized primarily by the risk difference, $RD_a=p_{\mathrm{AL},a}-p_{\mathrm{TL},a}$ (percentage points), with uncertainty quantified using Wilson confidence intervals and a Bayesian reference analysis with Jeffreys priors for binomial proportions. Across assessments, pooled pass rates were higher under AL than under TL, with the strongest separation observed for the global exam and the final mark. For these outcomes, the $95\%$ confidence intervals excluded zero, including under a random-intercept Bayesian model. We emphasize a constrained interpretation: the results provide a student-weighted benchmark of ``AL as implemented'' versus ``TL as implemented'' in this setting, without isolating the causal effect of individual instructional techniques. Implications are discussed for departmental decision-making and feasible next steps in evaluation, including improved student data collection and more robust qualitative analysis.</description>

      <title>Formative experience for intensive instruction physics courses: Evaluation and results in an Electromagnetism course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising demand for higher education has led universities to offer courses in multiple formats, including Intensive Instruction Courses (IICs), to meet the needs of a diverse student body. While active teaching methods improve physics understanding in standard courses, little research has examined their effectiveness in IICs. This research explored the most efficient methodologies for promoting meaningful learning in intensive physics courses. To this end, an integrated pedagogical proposal was designed based on the opinions gathered from a focus group of teachers with previous experience teaching these courses, as well as on existing literature, highlighting methodologies, types of assessment, and characteristics of ICCs. To evaluate its efficiency, a quasi-experiment was conducted in which students were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG), which followed the teaching proposal, and a control group (CG), which received non-innovated lessons. Results were measured using the BEMA electromagnetism concepts inventory before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis revealed that Hake's Gain was greater in the EG, both in general terms and in each thematic unit of the course. The intervention in the EG showed that the use of active methodologies was more efficient than those used in the CG in the context of IICs. The results obtained suggest the need to continue investigating other factors involved in the teaching-learning process of IICs.</description>
