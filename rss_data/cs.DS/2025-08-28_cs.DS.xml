      <title>Efficiently Coloring the Intersection of a General Matroid and Partition Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows a polynomial-time algorithm, that given a general matroid $M_1 = (X, \mathcal{I}_1)$ and $k-1$ partition matroids $ M_2, \ldots, M_k$, produces a coloring of the intersection $M = \cap_{i=1}^k M_i$ using at most $1+\sum_{i=1}^k \left(\chi(M_i) -1\right)$ colors. This is the first polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for matroid intersection coloring where one of the matroids may be a general matroid. Leveraging the fact that all of the standard combinatorial matroids reduce to partition matroids at a loss of a factor of two in the chromatic number, this algorithm also yields a polynomial-time $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for matroid intersection coloring in the case where each of the matroids $ M_2, \ldots, M_k$ are one of the standard combinatorial types.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Sorting Algorithm for Persistent Random Comparison Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sorting $n$ elements subject to persistent random comparison errors. In this problem, each comparison between two elements can be wrong with some fixed (small) probability $p$, and comparing the same pair of elements multiple times always yields the same result. Sorting perfectly in this model is impossible, and the objective is to minimize the dislocation of each element in the output sequence, i.e., the difference between its position in the sequence and its true rank.
  In this paper, we present the first $O(n\log n)$-time sorting algorithm that guarantees both $O(\log n)$ maximum dislocation and $O(n)$ total dislocation with high probability when $p&lt;\frac{1}{4}$. This settles the time complexity sorting with persistent comparison errors in the given range of $p$ and shows that comparison errors do not increase its computational difficulty. Indeed, $\Omega(n\log n)$ time is necessary to archive a maximum dislocation of $O(\log n)$ even without comparison errors. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can guarantee a maximum dislocation of $o(\log n)$ with high probability, nor a total dislocation of $o(n)$ in expectation.
  To develop our sorting algorithm, we solve two related sub-problems, which might be of independent interest. More precisely, we show that $O(\log n)$ time suffices to find a position in which to insert a new element $x$ in an almost-sorted sequence $S$ of $n$ elements having dislocation at most $d=\Omega(\log n)$, so that the dislocation of $x$ in the resulting sequence is $O(d)$ with high probability (which can be equivalently thought as the problem of estimating the rank of $x$ in $S$). We also show that the maximum (resp. total) dislocation of an approximately sorted sequence $S$ of $n$ elements can be lowered to $O(\log n)$ (resp. $O(n)$) in $O(nd)$ time, w.h.p., where $d$ is an upper bound on the maximum dislocation of $S$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Wiggle in Storylines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A storyline visualization shows interactions between characters over time. Each character is represented by an x-monotone curve. Time is mapped to the x-axis, and groups of characters that interact at a particular point $t$ in time must be ordered consecutively in the y-dimension at $x=t$. The predominant objective in storyline optimization so far has been the minimization of crossings between (blocks of) characters. Building on this work, we investigate another important, but less studied quality criterion, namely the minimization of wiggle, i.e., the amount of vertical movement of the characters over time. Given a storyline instance together with an ordering of the characters at any point in time, we show that wiggle count minimization is NP-complete. In contrast, we provide algorithms based on mathematical programming to solve linear wiggle height minimization and quadratic wiggle height minimization efficiently. Finally, we introduce a new method for routing character curves that focuses on keeping distances between neighboring curves constant as long as they run in parallel. We have implemented our algorithms, and we conduct a case study that explores the differences between the three optimization objectives. We use existing benchmark data, but we also present a new use case for storylines, namely the visualization of rolling stock schedules in railway operation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Sparsest Cut via Eigenvalue Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new, improved bounds for approximating the sparsest cut value or in other words the conductance $\phi$ of a graph in the CONGEST model. As our main result, we present an algorithm running in $O(\log^2 n/\phi)$ rounds in which every vertex outputs a value $\tilde \phi$ satisfying $\phi \le \tilde \phi \le \sqrt{2.01\phi}$. In most regimes, our algorithm improves significantly over the previously fastest algorithm for the problem [Chen, Meierhans, Probst Gutenberg, Saranurak; SODA 25]. Additionally, our result generalizes to $k$-way conductance.
  We obtain these results, by approximating the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix $L:=I-\rm{Deg}^{-1/2}A\rm{Deg}^ {-1/2}$, where, $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $\rm{Deg}$ is the diagonal matrix with the weighted degrees on the diagonal. The previous state of the art sparsest cut algorithm is in the technical realm of expander decompositions. Our algorithms, on the other hand, are relatively simple and easy to implement. At the core, they rely on the well-known power method, which comes down to repeatedly multiplying the Laplacian with a vector. This operation can be performed in a single round in the CONGEST model. All our algorithms apply to weighted, undirected graphs. Our lower bounds apply even in unweighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Matching with Pair-Dependent Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(U \cup V, E)$ be a bipartite graph, where $U$ represents jobs and $V$ represents machines. We study a new variant of the bipartite matching problem in which each job in $U$ can be matched to at most one machine in $V$, and the number of jobs that can be assigned to a machine depends on the specific jobs matched to it. These pair-dependent bounds reflect systems where different jobs have varying tolerance for congestion, determined by the specific machine they are assigned to.
  We define a bipartite PD-matching as a set of edges $M \subseteq E$ that satisfies these job-to-machine tolerance constraints. This variant of matching extends well-known matching problems, however, despite its relevance to real-world systems, it has not been studied before. We study bipartite PD-matchings with the objective of maximizing the matching size. As we show, the problem exhibits significant differences from previously studied matching problems. We analyze its computational complexity both in the general case and for specific restricted instances, presenting hardness results alongside optimal and approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Flow-weighted Layered Metric Euclidean Capacitated Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by hierarchical networks, we introduce the Flow-weighted Layered Metric Euclidean Capacitated Steiner Tree (FLaMECaST) problem, a variant of the Euclidean Steiner tree with layered structure and capacity constraints per layer. The goal is to construct a cost-optimal Steiner forest connecting a set of sources to a set of sinks under load-dependent edge costs. We prove that FLaMECaST is NP-hard to approximate, even in restricted cases where all sources lie on a circle. However, assuming few additional constraints for such instances, we design a dynamic program that achieves a $\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^n}\right)$-approximation in polynomial time. By generalizing the structural insights the dynamic program is based on, we extend the approach to certain settings, where all sources are positioned on a convex polygon.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for accurate and simple-looking metaphorical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19810v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Metaphorical maps" or "contact representations" are visual representations of vertex-weighted graphs that rely on the geographic map metaphor. The vertices are represented by countries, the weights by the areas of the countries, and the edges by contacts/ boundaries among them. The accuracy with which the weights are mapped to areas and the simplicity of the polygons representing the countries are the two classical optimization goals for metaphorical maps. Mchedlidze and Schnorr [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022] presented a force-based algorithm that creates metaphorical maps that balance between these two optimization goals. Their maps look visually simple, but the accuracy of the maps is far from optimal - the countries' areas can vary up to 30% compared to required. In this paper, we provide a multi-fold extension of the algorithm in [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022]. More specifically:
  1. Towards improving accuracy: We introduce the notion of region stiffness and suggest a technique for varying the stiffness based on the current pressure of map regions.
  2. Towards maintaining simplicity: We introduce a weight coefficient to the pressure force exerted on each polygon point based on whether the corresponding point appears along a narrow passage.
  3. Towards generality: We cover, in contrast to [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022], non-triangulated graphs. This is done by either generating points where more than three regions meet or by introducing holes in the metaphorical map.
  We perform an extended experimental evaluation that, among other results, reveals that our algorithm is able to construct metaphorical maps with nearly perfect area accuracy with a little sacrifice in their simplicity.</description>

      <title>Internally-Convex Drawings of Outerplanar Graphs in Small Area</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known result by Kant [Algorithmica, 1996] implies that n-vertex outerplane graphs admit embedding-preserving planar straight-line grid drawings where the internal faces are convex polygons in $O(n^2)$ area. In this paper, we present an algorithm to compute such drawings in $O(n^{1.5})$ area. We also consider outerplanar drawings in which the internal faces are required to be strictly-convex polygons. In this setting, we consider outerplanar graphs whose weak dual is a path and give a drawing algorithm that achieves $\Theta(nk^2)$ area, where $k$ is the maximum size of an internal facial cycle.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A witness drawing of a graph is a visualization that clearly shows a given property of a graph. We study and implement various drawing paradigms for witness drawings to clearly show that graphs have bounded pathwidth or treewidth. Our approach draws the tree decomposition or path decomposition as a tree of bags, with induced subgraphs shown in each bag, and with ''tracks'' for each graph vertex connecting its copies in multiple bags. Within bags, we optimize the vertex layout to avoid crossings of edges and tracks. We implement a visualization prototype for crossing minimization using dynamic programming for graphs of small width and heuristic approaches for graphs of larger width. We introduce a taxonomy of drawing styles, which render the subgraph for each bag as an arc diagram with one or two pages or as a circular layout with straight-line edges, and we render tracks either with straight lines or with orbital-radial paths.</description>

      <title>An efficient implementation for solving the all pairs minimax path problem in an undirected dense graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an efficient $ O(n^2) $ implementation for solving the all pairs minimax path problem or widest path problem in an undirected dense graph. It is a code implementation of the Algorithm 4 (MMJ distance by Calculation and Copy) in a previous paper. The distance matrix is also called the all points path distance (APPD). We conducted experiments to test the implementation and algorithm, compared it with several other algorithms for solving the APPD matrix. Result shows Algorithm 4 works good for solving the widest path or minimax path APPD matrix. It can drastically improve the efficiency for computing the APPD matrix. There are several theoretical outcomes which claim the APPD matrix can be solved accurately in $ O(n^2) $ . However, they are impractical because there is no code implementation of these algorithms. It seems Algorithm 4 is the first algorithm that has an actual code implementation for solving the APPD matrix of minimax path or widest path problem in $ O(n^2) $, in an undirected dense graph.</description>

      <title>New Algorithm for Combinatorial $n$-folds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block-structured integer linear programs (ILPs) play an important role in various application fields. We address $n$-fold ILPs where the matrix $A$ has a specific structure, i.e., where the blocks in the lower part of A consist only of the row vectors $(1, ... ,1)$.
  In this paper, we propose an approach tailored to exactly these combinatorial $n$-folds. We utilize a divide and conquer approach to separate the original problem such that the right-hand side iteratively decreases in size. We show that this decrease in size can be calculated such that we only need to consider a bounded amount of possible right-hand sides. This, in turn, lets us efficiently combine solutions of the smaller right-hand sides to solve the original problem. We can decide the feasibility of, and also optimally solve, such problems in time $(nr\Delta)^{O(r)} \log(\|b\|_\infty)$, where $n$ is the number of blocks, $r$ the number of rows in the upper blocks and $\Delta=\|A\|_\infty$.
  We complement the algorithm by discussing applications of the $n$-fold ILPs with the specific structure we require. We consider the problems of (i) scheduling on uniform machines, (ii) closest string and (iii) (graph) imbalance.
  Regarding (i), our algorithm results in running times of $p_{\max}^{O(d)}\text{poly}(I)$, matching a lower bound derived via ETH.
  For (ii) we achieve running times matching the current state-of-the-art in the general case. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, our result can leverage a bounded number of column-types to yield an improved running time.
  For (iii), we improve the parameter dependency on the size of the vertex cover.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distributed Replacement Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the replacement paths problem in the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model of distributed computing. Given an $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$, the goal is to compute, for every edge $e$ in $P$, the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ avoiding $e$. For unweighted directed graphs, we establish the tight randomized round complexity bound for this problem as $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^{2/3} + D)$ by showing matching upper and lower bounds. Our upper bound extends to $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for weighted directed graphs. Our lower bound applies even to the second simple shortest path problem, which asks only for the smallest replacement path length. These results improve upon the very recent work of Manoharan and Ramachandran (SIROCCO 2024), who showed a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2} + D)$ and an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3} + \sqrt{n h_{st}} + D)$, where $h_{st}$ is the number of hops in the given $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameterizations of $k$-Planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of $k$-planarity is extensively studied in the context of Beyond Planarity. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane in which each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. The local crossing number of a graph is the minimum integer $k$ such that it is $k$-planar. The problem of determining whether an input graph is $1$-planar is known to be NP-complete even for near-planar graphs [Cabello and Mohar, SIAM J. Comput. 2013], that is, the graphs obtained from planar graphs by adding a single edge. Moreover, the local crossing number is hard to approximate within a factor $2 - \varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ [Urschel and Wellens, IPL 2021]. To address this computational intractability, Bannister, Cabello, and Eppstein [JGAA 2018] investigated the parameterized complexity of the case of $k = 1$, particularly focusing on structural parameterizations on input graphs, such as treedepth, vertex cover number, and feedback edge number. In this paper, we extend their approach by considering the general case $k \ge 1$ and give (tight) parameterized upper and lower bound results. In particular, we strengthen the aforementioned lower bound results to subclasses of constant-treewidth graphs: we show that testing $1$-planarity is NP-complete even for near-planar graphs with feedback vertex set number at most $3$ and pathwidth at most $4$, and the local crossing number is hard to approximate within any constant factor for graphs with feedback vertex set number at most $2$.</description>

Abstract: The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level, where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and Chaudhury [USENIX Security `21, `22], which bounds error in terms of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et al.'s randomized response technique [ICALP `23], and a novel analysis, yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala et al. [FOCS `22]. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative approximation errors by up to six orders of magnitude, while maintaining competitive runtime.</description>

      <title>Approximate Lifted Model Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20784</link>

Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</description>
