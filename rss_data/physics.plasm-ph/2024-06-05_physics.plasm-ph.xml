      <title>Anomalous thermal relaxation in Yukawa fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform microscopic many-body simulations of the thermal relaxation of a realistic warm Yukawa fluid by solving the dynamics of an ensemble of N particles in a cubic box acting as a heat reservoir kept at fixed temperature. For specific conditions of density, ion size and potential interaction range we find novel anomalous thermal relaxation for these systems, exhibiting faster cooling from increasingly larger temperature values. Our findings show that the interplay among finite particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understanding the features of the cooling curve $T(t)$. The non-Newtonian thermal behavior is analyzed in terms of a time-dependent relaxation time $\tau(t)$ and a generalized Langevin equation. We compare our results to existing Mpemba-like phenomena and interpret temperature oscillation patterns arising from a non-trivial memory function. Further, we consider the impact of composition admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and the more general implications for non-Markovian systems where Yukawa-like potentials are involved, such as astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Error Field Predictability and Consequences for ITER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ITER coil tolerances are re-evaluated using the modern understanding of coupling to least-stable plasma modes and an updated center-line-traced model of ITER's coil windings. This reassessment finds the tolerances to be conservative through a statistical, linear study of $n=1$ error fields (EFs) due to tilted, shifted misplacements and nominal windings of central solenoid and poloidal field coils within tolerance. We also show that a model-based correction scheme remains effective even when metrology quality is sub-optimal, and compare this to projected empirical correction schemes. We begin with an analysis of the necessity of error field correction (EFC) for daily operation in ITER using scaling laws for the EF penetration threshold. We then consider the predictability of EF dominant mode overlap across early planned ITER scenarios and, as measuring EFs in high power scenarios can pose risks to the device, the potential for extrapolation to the ITER Baseline Scenario (IBS). We find that carefully designing a scenario matching currents proportionally to those of the IBS is far more important than plasma shape or profiles in accurately measuring an optimal correction current set.</description>

      <title>A compact stellarator-tokamak hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokamaks and stellarators are the leading two magnetic confinement devices for producing fusion energy, begging the question of whether the strengths of the two could be merged into a single concept. To meet this challenge, we propose a first-of-its kind optimized stellarator-tokamak hybrid. Compared to a typical tokamak coil set, only a single simple type of stellarator coil has to be added which leads to a compact, volume- and transport-preserving magnetic field, with an added rotational transform that reaches levels thought to enhance stability.</description>

      <title>Negative-polarity nanosecond-pulsed cryogenic plasma in liquid nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we report the results of imaging and spectroscopic measurements of optical emission spectrum of negative nanosecond-pulsed cryogenic discharge in liquid nitrogen. With the application of lower electric fields, the discharge first ignites as a 'faint glow' around the high voltage needle electrode, while when the applied electric field reaches transition value of around 5 MV cm-1, the discharge mode switches to negative in-liquid streamer. Optical emission spectrum of the discharge is populated by the molecular nitrogen emission bands, and their analysis shows that the pressures and temperatures of the negative streamers in liquid nitrogen are at least of few tens of atmospheres and around 140-150 K. The results of the study demonstrate similarity of positive and negative streamers in the cryogenic in-liquid plasma conditions.</description>

      <title>Porting the grid-based 3D+3V hybrid-Vlasov kinetic plasma simulation Vlasiator to heterogeneous GPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vlasiator is a space plasma simulation code which models near-Earth ion-kinetic dynamics in three spatial and three velocity dimensions. It is highly parallelized, modeling the Vlasov equation directly through the distribution function, discretized on a Cartesian grid, instead of the more common particle-in-cell approach. Modeling near-Earth space, plasma properties span several orders of magnitude in temperature, density, and magnetic field strength. In order to fit the required six-dimensional grids in memory, Vlasiator utilizes a sparse block-based velocity mesh, where chunks of velocity space are added or deleted based on the advection requirements of the Vlasov solver. In addition, the spatial mesh is adaptively refined through cell-based octree refinement. In this paper, we describe the design choices of porting Vlasiator to heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures. We detail the memory management, algorithmic changes, and kernel construction as well as our unified codebase approach, resulting in portability to both NVIDIA and AMD hardware (CUDA and HIP languages, respectively). In particular, we showcase a highly parallel block adjustment approach allowing efficient re-ordering of a sparse velocity mesh. We detail pitfalls we have overcome and lay out a plan for optimization to facilitate future exascale simulations using multi-node GPU supercomputing.</description>

      <title>Jet formation model from accretion disks of electron-ion-photon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of Astrophysical Jet formation from relativistic accretion disks through the establishment of relativistic disk-powerful jet equilibrium structure is studied applying the Beltrami-Bernoulli equilibrium approach of Shatashvili &amp; Yoshida 2011; Arshilava et al. 2019. Accretion disk is weakly magnetized consisting of fully ionized relativistic electron-ion plasma and photon gas strongly coupled to electrons due to Thompson Scattering. %hence, making the behavior of photon gas similar to that of "a charged fluid". Analysis is based on the generalized Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha $-turbulent dissipation model for local viscosity (being the main source of accretion), in which the contributions from both the photon and ion gases are taken into account. Ignoring the self-gravitation in the disk we constructed the analytical self-similar solutions for the equilibrium relativistic disk-jet structure characteristic parameters in the field of gravitating central compact object for the force-free condition. It is shown, that the magnetic field energy in the Jet is several orders greater compared to that of accretion disk, while jet-outflow is locally Super-Alfv\'enic with local {\it Plasma-beta} $&lt; 1$ near the jet-axis. The derived solutions can be used to analyze the astrophysical jets observed in binary systems during the star formation process linking the jet properties with the parameters of relativistic accretion disks of electron-ion-photon gas.</description>

      <title>Neural network sampling of Bethe-Heitler process in particle-in-cell codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses neural networks to improve Monte Carlo (MC) implementations of the Bethe-Heitler process in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes. We provide a neural network that is as accurate as pre-calculated tables, and requires a hundred times less memory to store. It is trained to predict Bethe-Heitler pair production cross-sections for atomic numbers 1-50 and photon energies between 1 MeV and 10 GeV in the PIC code OSIRIS. We first validate our approach against a theoretical estimate in a simplified context. We later prove that both approaches have similar performance in a typical relativistic laser-plasma interaction scenario. The large memory decrease accessible with neural networks will enable introducing more advanced cross-section models for Bethe-Heitler pair production and other QED mechanisms in the MC modules of PIC codes.</description>

      <title>Quantized tensor networks for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide an \textit{ab-initio} description of collisionless plasmas, but solving them is often impractical because of the wide range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved and the high dimensionality of the problem. In this work, we present a quantum-inspired semi-implicit Vlasov-Maxwell solver that utilizes the quantized tensor network (QTN) framework. With this QTN solver, the cost of grid-based numerical simulation of size $N$ is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(D))$, where $D$ is the ``rank'' or ``bond dimension'' of the QTN and is typically set to be much smaller than $N$. We find that for the five-dimensional test problems considered here, a modest $D=64$ appears to be sufficient for capturing the expected physics despite the simulations using a total of $N=2^{36}$ grid points, \edit{which would require $D=2^{18}$ for full-rank calculations}. Additionally, we observe that a QTN time evolution scheme based on the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle allows one to use somewhat larger time steps than prescribed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. As such, this work demonstrates that the QTN format is a promising means of approximately solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations with significantly reduced cost.</description>
