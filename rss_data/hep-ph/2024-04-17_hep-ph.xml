      <title>Neutrino and Gamma-Ray Signatures of Inelastic Dark Matter Annihilating outside Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new inelastic dark matter search: neutron stars in dark matter-rich environments capture inelastic dark matter which, for interstate mass splittings between about $45 - 285 \ \rm MeV$, will annihilate away before becoming fully trapped inside the object. This means a sizable fraction of the dark matter particles can annihilate while being outside the neutron star, producing neutron star-focused gamma-rays and neutrinos. We analyze this effect for the first time and target the neutron star population in the Galactic Center, where the large dark matter and neutron star content makes this signal most significant. Depending on the assumed neutron star and dark matter distributions, we set constraints on the dark matter-nucleon inelastic cross-section using existing H.E.S.S. observations. We also forecast the sensitivity of upcoming gamma-ray and neutrino telescopes to this signal, which can reach inelastic cross-sections as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-47} \ \rm cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical predictions for $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the state of the art of the theoretical calculations for decays mediated by $b\to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions, for $\ell=e,\mu$. I focus on the predictions of observables in $B\to K \mu^+\mu^-$, $B\to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$, and $B_s\to \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ decays, as many of these predictions are in tension with the corresponding experimental measurements. I also briefly discuss the $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda \mu^+\mu^-$ decay and present a new calculation for this channel. Special emphasis is placed on the non-local contributions, as they are the largest systematic uncertainties in these decays. The current theoretical calculations for $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays are not able to explain the tensions with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>A critical study of the Monte Carlo replica method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed mathematical study of the Monte Carlo replica method as applied in the global fitting literature from the high-energy physics theory community. For the first time, we provide a rigorous derivation of the parameter distributions implied by the method, and show that, whilst they agree with Bayesian posteriors for linear models, they disagree otherwise. We proceed to numerically quantify the disagreement between the Monte Carlo replica method and the Bayesian method in the context of two phenomenologically relevant scenarios: fits of the SMEFT Wilson coefficients, and fits of PDFs (albeit in a toy scenario). In both scenarios, we find that uncertainty estimates of the quantities of interest are discrepant between the two approaches when non-linearity is relevant. Our findings motivate future investigation of Bayesian methodologies for global PDF fits, especially in the context of simultaneous determination of PDFs and SMEFT Wilson coefficients.</description>

      <title>SMEFT predictions for semileptonic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ invariance of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) predicts multiple restrictions in the space of Wilson coefficients of $U(1)_{em}$ invariant effective lagrangians such as the Low-energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), used for low-energy flavor-physics observables, or the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) in unitary gauge, appropriate for weak-scale observables. In this work, we derive and list all such predictions for semileptonic operators up to dimension 6. We find that these predictions can be expressed as 2223 linear relations among the HEFT/LEFT Wilson coefficients, that are completely independent of any assumptions about the alignment of the mass and flavor bases. These relations connect diverse experimental searches such as rare meson decays, high-$p_T$ dilepton searches, top decays, $Z$-pole observables, charged lepton flavor violating observables and non-standard neutrino interaction searches. We demonstrate how these relations can be used to derive strong indirect constraints on multiple Wilson coefficients that are currently either weakly constrained from direct experiments or have no direct bound at all. These relations also imply, in general, that evidence for new physics in a particular search channel must be accompanied by correlated anomalies in other channels.</description>

      <title>Solar reflection of dark matter with dark-photon mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of low-mass halo dark-matter particles in the hot plasma of the Sun, focusing on dark matter that interact with ordinary matter through a dark-photon mediator. The resulting ``solar-reflected'' dark matter (SRDM) component contains high-velocity particles, which significantly extend the sensitivity of terrestrial direct-detection experiments to sub-MeV dark-matter masses. We use a detailed Monte-Carlo simulation to model the propagation and scattering of dark-matter particles in the Sun, including thermal effects, with special emphasis on ultralight dark-photon mediators. We study the properties of the SRDM flux, obtain exclusion limits from various direct-detection experiments, and provide projections for future experiments, focusing especially on those with silicon and xenon targets. We find that proposed future experiments with xenon and silicon targets can probe the entire ``freeze-in benchmark,'' in which dark matter is coupled to an ultralight dark photon, including dark-matter masses as low as $\mathcal{O}$(keV). Our simulations and SRDM fluxes are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Black Hole Events in Future Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic black hole production at future hadron colliders is a promising avenue to explore low scale gravity models like ADD. This study investigates production cross-sections and final state properties of these black holes using the BlackMax event generator. We analyze scenarios with varying proton-proton collision energies (27 TeV and 100 TeV), number of extra dimensions (2, 4, and 6), and black hole rotation. Black holes are found to decay to up to seventeen particles, which have high transverse momentum (up to 30 TeV) and concentrated in the central region. This unique signature allows them to be distinguished from background processes. The parameter space explored suggests future colliders like HE-LHC and FCC-hh have the potential to probe low scale gravity models.</description>

      <title>The $N_{\rm eff}$ at CMB challenges $U(1)_X$ light gauge boson scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$) is one of the crucial cosmological parameters. The precise measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of cosmic microwave background formation, by Planck 2018 can be used to understand the new fundamental interactions, in particular involving light mediators. Presence of any new particle with sufficient energy density and sizeable interactions with Standard Model particles at the temperature around $\sim$ MeV can significantly alter the neutrino decoupling and hence $N_{\rm eff}$. Thus the bound on $N_{\rm eff}$ can place stringent constraints on various beyond Standard Model paradigms involving light particles. $U(1)_X$ models are among such scenarios and are widely studied in several aspects. In this work, we consider several popular $U(1)_X$ models with light $Z'$ boson like $U(1)_{B-L}$, $U(1)_{B - 3L_i}$, $U(1)_{B_i - 3 L_j}$, $U(1)_{L_i - L_j}$; $i,j =1,2,3$ being the flavour indices and study their impact on $N_{\rm eff}$. We also examine the constraints from ground based experiments like Xenon1T, Borexino, trident, etc. Our analysis shows that for light mass $M_{Z'} \lesssim \mathcal{O} (\rm{MeV})$ the $N_{\rm eff}$ provides the most stringent constraints on the $Z'$ mass and coupling, far exceeding the existing constraints from other experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition in soft-wall AdS/QCD with scalar-dilaton coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral phase boundary of nuclear matter is expected to have a critical point where the rapid crossover of lattice methods at zero chemical potential becomes a first-order phase transition. Phenomenological models based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, known as AdS/ QCD, have succeeded in capturing many features of nuclear matter, with recent progress in producing the expected critical point. We study a model that produces a critical point in the chiral phase diagram by introducing a coupling between the scalar chiral field and the dilaton. We examine the effect of the scalar-dilaton coupling on the critical point. We also study the zero-temperature chiral dynamics, which must allow for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of zero quark mass. We find that when the scalar-dilaton coupling is large enough to ensure correct zero-temperature chiral dynamics, a critical point is present only if the quark mass is greater than 12.8 MeV.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Thermal Radiation: A Classical Derivation of the Planck Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A derivation of the Planck spectrum for thermal radiation is given based upon wave fluctuations within relativistic classical physics. The derivation depends crucially on thermal fluctuations existing above the fundamental inertial-frame-independent fluctuations of classical zero-point radiation. Such frame-independent zero-point fluctuations exist only in a relativistic wave theory and cannot exist in a nonrelativistic wave theory. Thus such a classical derivation of the Planck spectrum exists in a Lorentz-covariant classical theory, such as classical electrodynamics, but not in a Galilean-covariant theory where all waves are based upon material media. Classical zero-point radiation provides a purely classical alternative to quanta in the analysis of the Planck spectrum.</description>

      <title>Majoron-Driven Leptogenesis in Gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario in the gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. Achieving successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase is challenging due to the absence of a CP phase, caused by restriction from the gauge symmetry. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional global symmetry, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and a scalar field $\Phi$ responsible for breaking this symmetry. Through the kinetic misalignment mechanism, the majoron field associated with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking has a kinetic motion in the early universe. Subsequently, time-dependent majoron field background induces the background CP phase dynamically, leading to successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase. Furthermore, majoron itself serves as a dark matter candidate in this scenario. As one of the phenomenological applications, we consider the model that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.</description>

      <title>The N2HDM, Entropy Production and Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study undertakes a reconsideration of the potential for a first-order electroweak phase transition, focusing on the next-to-minimal two Higgs doublet model (N2HDM). Our exploration spans diverse parameter spaces associated with the phase transition, with a particular emphasis on examining the generation of stochastic Gravitational Waves (GW) resulting from this transition. The obtained results are meticulously compared against data from prominent gravitational wave observatories, and the possibility of their detection in the future GW observations have been established. In passing by we analyse the strength of the phase transition through the production of entropy during the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to gravitational microlensing from extended objects and gravitational wave detection from compact binaries, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such ``halo'' axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries for the 4HDM. II. Extensions by rephasing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue classification of finite groups which can be used as symmetry group of the scalar sector of the four-Higgs-doublet model (4HDM). We systematically construct non-abelian groups via the group extension procedure, starting from the known abelian groups $A$ and their automorphism groups $\mbox{Aut}(A)$. Previously, we considered all cyclic groups $A$ available for the 4HDM scalar sector. Here, we further develop the method and apply it to extensions by the remaining rephasing groups $A$, namely $A = \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. As $\mbox{Aut}(A)$ grows, the procedure becomes more laborious, but we prove an isomorphism theorem which helps classify all the options. We also comment on what remains to be done to complete the classification of all finite non-abelian groups realizable in the 4HDM scalar sector without accidental continuous symmetries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes for multiple axion fields with comparable masses, motivated by string theory constructions, which typically exhibit a large number of light axions, with a broad range of masses. We show, in particular, that even though superradiant clouds for the heavier axion species grow faster, they are eventually reabsorbed by the black hole as the latter amplifies the lighter axion field(s), analogously to the dynamics of different species competing for the same resources in an ecosystem. We also incorporate in our study the effects of accretion and gravitational wave emission. We further demonstrate that the existence of multiple axion species with comparable masses may have a substantial impact on the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by axion clouds around black hole binary merger remnants, which could be probed with planned detectors.</description>

      <title>More variables or more bins? Impact on the EFT interpretation of Drell-Yan measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize previous studies on constraining operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory using Drell-Yan (DY) measurements to include at the same time all relevant operators and uncertainties. It has been shown that fully differential measurements (triple differential for neutral and double differential for charged) are more sensitive to EFT effects. Nevertheless, due to the finite statistics, the fully differential measurements sacrifice some statistical power on the shape (less invariant mass or transverse momentum bins) in favour of more kinematic variables. We show that when the observables are particularly sensitive to the shape of the distributions, such as the invariant mass of the two leptons in neutral DY, the single differential measurement with more bins, may be as sensitive as the fully differential one, at least for specific EFT operators. This suggests to always supplement fully differential analyses with projections into the relevant distributions evaluated with finer bins.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal spin asymmetries in pion-polarized proton induced Drell-Yan process at COMPASS using holographic light-front QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute all the leading-twist azimuthal spin asymmetries in the pion-proton induced Drell-Yan process. These spin asymmetries arise from convolutions of the leading-twist transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of both the incoming pion and the target proton. We employ the holographic light-front pion wave functions for the pion TMDs, while for the proton TMDs, we utilize a light-front quark-diquark model constructed by the soft-wall AdS/QCD. The gluon rescattering is crucial to predict nonzero time-reversal odd TMDs. We study the utility of a nonperturbative SU$(3)$ gluon rescattering kernel, which extends beyond the typical assumption of perturbative U$(1)$ gluons. Subsequently, we employ Collins-Soper scale evolution at Next-to-Leading Logarithmic precision for the TMDs evolution. Our predictions for the spin asymmetries are consistent with the available experimental data from COMPASS and other phenomenological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, in special the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the Cryogenic Measurement System of a Resonant Haloscope Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible light bosonic dark matter interactions with the Standard Model photon have been searched by microwave resonant cavities. In this paper, we demonstrate the cryogenic readout system calibration of a 7.138 GHz copper cavity with a loaded quality factor $Q_l=10^4$, operated at 22 mK temperature based on a dilution refrigerator. Our readout system consists of High Electron Mobility Transistors as cryogenic amplifiers at 4 K, plus room-temperature amplifiers and a spectrum analyzer for signal power detection. We test the system with a superconducting two-level system as a single-photon source in the microwave frequency regime and report an overall 95.6 dB system gain and -71.4 dB attenuation in the cavity's input channel. The effective noise temperature of the measurement system is 7.5 K.</description>

      <title>Scalar field dark matter with time-varying equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of scalar field dark matter interacting with dark energy. Adopting a fluid description of the dark matter field in the regime of rapid oscillations, we find that the equation of state for dark matter is non-zero and even becomes increasingly negative at late times during dark energy domination. Furthermore, the speed of sound of dark matter is non-vanishing at all length scales, and a non-adiabatic pressure contribution arises. The results indicate that there are still unexplored possible interactions within the dark sector that lead to novel background effects and can impact structure formation processes.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD determination of the normalization of the leading-twist photon distribution amplitude and susceptibility of the quark condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The normalization of the leading-twist photon distribution amplitude (DA), $f_{\gamma}^{\perp}$, is an important ingredient in the study of exclusive processes involving the photon emission by means of QCD sum-rules. In this paper we determine the up- , down- and strange-quark contribution to $f_{\gamma}^{\perp}$ by exploiting its relation to the zero-momentum two-point correlation function of the electromagnetic current $J_{\rm em}^{\mu}$ and the electric component of the tensor current $T^{\mu\nu}$. To that end we employ the gauge ensembles obtained by using $N_{f}=2+1+1$ Wilson-Clover twisted-mass quark flavors, generated by the Extended Twisted Mass (ETM) Collaboration, and after adding all sources of systematic uncertainties, we obtain a total error of $1.5\%$ and $3.5\%$, respectively, for the light- ($u$ and $d$) and strange-quark contribution to $f_{\gamma}^{\perp}(2~{\rm GeV})$ in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, thus improving their accuracy by a factor of $2.3$ and $2.8$, respectively. For the strange-quark contribution $f_{\gamma,s}^{\perp}(2~{\rm GeV})$, we observe a discrepancy with respect to previous lattice calculations. By combining our result with the world average lattice value of the chiral condensate, we obtain for the susceptibility of the quark condensate $\chi_d^{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}} (2\, {\rm GeV}) \simeq \chi_u^{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}} (2\, {\rm GeV}) =2.17(12)~{\rm GeV^{-2}}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation at the Crossroads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of Cosmic Inflation to explain the latest Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data is assessed by performing Bayesian model comparison within the landscape of nearly three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation. We present the first Bayesian data analysis based on the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra. In particular, the fourth Hubble-flow function $\epsilon_4$ remains unbounded while the third function verifies, at two-sigma, $\epsilon_{3}\in[-0.4,0.5]$, which is perfectly compatible with the slow-roll predictions for the running of the spectral index. We also observe some residual excess of $B$-modes within the BICEP/Keck data favoring, at a non-statistically significant level, non-vanishing primordial tensor modes: $\log(\epsilon_{1}) &gt; -3.9$, at $68\%$ confidence level. Then, for 283 models of single-field inflation, we compute the Bayesian evidence, the Bayesian dimensionality and the marginalized posteriors of all the models' parameters, including the ones associated with the reheating era. The average information gain on the reheating parameter $R_\mathrm{reh}$ reaches $1.3 \pm 0.18$ bits, which is more than a factor two improvement compared to the first Planck data release. As such, inflationary model predictions cannot meet data accuracy without specifying, or marginalizing over, the reheating kinematics. We also find that more than $40\%$ of the scenarios are now strongly disfavored, which shows that the constraining power of cosmological data is winning against the increase of the number of proposed models. In addition, about $20\%$ of all models have evidences within the most probable region and are all favored according to the Jeffreys' scale of Bayesian evidences.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

Abstract: This work offers the constraints on the anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings for the process $e^+e^- \to ZZ $ at the CLIC with $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV. The realistic CLIC detector environments and their effects are considered in our analysis. The study is planned for the decays of produced $Z$ bosons to a pair of charged leptons (electrons or muons) and neutrino pairs. The bounds on the anomalous neutral triple gauge couplings defining $CP$-violating $C_{\widetilde{B}W}/{\Lambda^4}$ coupling and three $CP$-conserving $C_{WW}/{\Lambda^4}$, $C_{BW}/{\Lambda^4}$, and $C_{BB}/{\Lambda^4}$ couplings are obtained. Also, the effects and advantages of polarization for incoming electron beams in these calculations are investigated.</description>

      <title>Probing for chiral $Z^\prime$ gauge boson through scattering measurement experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of tiny neutrino mass can not be explained within the framework of Standard Model (SM), we consider extra gauge extended scenarios in which tiny neutrino masses are generated through seesaw mechanism. These scenarios are equipped with beyond the standard model (BSM) neutral gauge boson called $Z^\prime$ in the general $U(1)_X$ symmetry which is a linear combination of $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$. In this case, left and right handed fermions interact differently with the $Z^\prime$. The $Z^\prime$ gives rise to different processes involving neutrino-nucleon, neutrino-electron, electron-nucleus and electron-muon scattering processes. By comparing with proton, electron beam-dump experiments data, recast data from searches for the long-lived and dark photon at BaBaR, LHCb and CMS experiments, the electron and muon $g-2$ data, and the data of the dilepton and dijet searches at the LEP experiment, we derive bounds on the gauge coupling and the corresponding gauge boson mass for different $U(1)_X$ charges and evaluate the prospective limits from the future beam-dump scenarios at DUNE, FASER(2) and ILC. We conclude that large parameter regions could be probed by scattering, beam-dump and collider experiments in future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next generation direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments will have unprecedented capabilities to explore coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) complementary to dedicated neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that future DM experiments can effectively probe nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) mediated by scalar fields in the scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We set first limits on $S_1$ leptoquark models that result in sizable $\mu-d$ and $\tau-d$ sector neutrino NSI CE$\nu$NS contributions using LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) data. As we show, near future DM experiments reaching $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ton-year exposure, such as argon-based ARGO and xenon-based DARWIN, can probe parameter space of leptoquarks beyond the reach of current and planned collider facilities. We also analyze for the first time prospects for testing NSI in lead-based detectors. We discuss the ability of leptoquarks in the parameter space of interest to also explain the neutrino masses and $(g-2)_\mu$ observations.</description>

      <title>PCN: A Deep Learning Approach to Jet Tagging Utilizing Novel Graph Construction Methods and Chebyshev Graph Convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet tagging is a classification problem in high-energy physics experiments that aims to identify the collimated sprays of subatomic particles, jets, from particle collisions and tag them to their emitter particle. Advances in jet tagging present opportunities for searches of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Current approaches use deep learning to uncover hidden patterns in complex collision data. However, the representation of jets as inputs to a deep learning model have been varied, and often, informative features are withheld from models. In this study, we propose a graph-based representation of a jet that encodes the most information possible. To learn best from this representation, we design Particle Chebyshev Network (PCN), a graph neural network (GNN) using Chebyshev graph convolutions (ChebConv). ChebConv has been demonstrated as an effective alternative to classical graph convolutions in GNNs and has yet to be explored in jet tagging. PCN achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing taggers and opens the door to future studies into graph-based representations of jets and ChebConv layers in high-energy physics experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/YVSemlani/PCN-Jet-Tagging.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of the charged kaon in symmetric nuclear matter using a Bethe-Salpeter amplitude to model the quark-anti-quark bound state, which is well constrained by previous studies of its vacuum properties. The electromagnetic form factor, charge radius, decay constant and the light-front valence component probability are investigated in symmetric nuclear matter. In order to describe the constituent up and anti-strange quarks in nuclear matter, we adopt the ``quark-meson coupling (QMC) model", which has been widely applied to various hadronic and nuclear phenomena in the nuclear medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study confining dark sectors where the lightest hadrons are glueballs. Such models can provide viable dark matter candidates and appear in some neutral naturalness scenarios. In this work, we introduce a new phenomenological model of dark glueball hadronization inspired by the Lund string model. This enables us to make realistic predictions for dark glueball phenomenology at the LHC for the first time. Our model reproduces the expected thermal distribution of hadron species as an emergent consequence of hadronization dynamics. The ability to predict the production of glueball states heavier than the lightest species significantly expands the reach of long-lived glueball searches in MATHUSLA compared to previous simplified estimates. We also characterize regions of parameter space where emerging and/or semivisible jets could arise from pure-glue dark sectors, thereby providing new benchmark models that motivate searches for these signatures.</description>

      <title>An analysis of parton distributions in a pion with B\'ezier parametrizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of parametrizations for nonperturbative QCD functions in global analyses, with a specific application to extending a phenomenological analysis of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the charged pion realized in the xFitter fitting framework. The parametrization dependence of PDFs in our pion fits substantially enlarges the uncertainties from the experimental sources estimated in the previous analyses. We systematically explore the parametrization dependence by employing a novel technique to automate generation of polynomial parametrizations for PDFs that makes use of B\'ezier curves. This technique is implemented in a C++ module Fant\^omas that is included in the xFitter program. Our analysis reveals that the sea and gluon distributions in the pion are not well disentangled, even when considering measurements in leading-neutron deep inelastic scattering. For example, the pion PDF solutions with a vanishing gluon and large quark sea are still experimentally allowed, which elevates the importance of ongoing lattice and nonperturbative QCD calculations, together with the planned pion scattering experiments, for conclusive studies of the pion structure.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ photoproduction cross section at high energies from the Color Glass Condensate approach. The results are compared to the center-of-mass energy dependent $\gamma+A\to\mathrm{J}/\psi+A$ cross sections extracted from measurements in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. We predict strong saturation-driven nuclear suppression at high energies, while LHC data prefers even stronger suppression. We explore the effect of nucleon shape fluctuations on the nuclear suppression in the coherent and incoherent cross sections, and show that the most recent measurement of the $|t|$-differential incoherent $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section prefers large event-by-event fluctuations of the nucleon substructure in heavy nuclei, comparable to that found for a free proton.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays and Primordial Black Holes from a Supercooled Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An explicit realistic model featuring a supercooled phase transition, which allows us to explain the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays, is constructed. In this model the phase transition corresponds to radiative symmetry breaking (and mass generation) in a dark sector featuring a dark photon associated with the broken symmetry. The completion of the transition is ensured by a non-minimal coupling between gravity and the order parameter and fast reheating occurs thanks to a preheating phase. Finally, it is also shown that the model leads to primordial black hole production.</description>

      <title>Predictive Dirac Neutrino Spectrum with Strong CP Solution in $\pmb{SU(5)_L \times SU(5)_R}$ Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a grand unified theory of matter and forces based on the gauge symmetry $SU(5)_L\times SU(5)_R$ with parity interchanging the two factor groups. Our main motivation for such a construction is to realize a minimal GUT embedding of left-right symmetric models that provide a parity solution to the strong CP problem without the axion. We show how the gauge couplings unify with an intermediate gauge symmetry $SU(3)_{cL}\times SU(2)_{2L}\times U(1)_{L}\times SU(5)_R$, and establish its consistency with proton decay constraints. The model correctly reproduces the observed fermion masses and mixings and leads to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their Yukawa couplings suppressed by a factor $M_I/M_G$, the ratio of the intermediate scale to the GUT scale. We call this mechanism type II-Dirac seesaw. Furthermore, the model predicts $\delta_{CP} = \pm (130.4 \pm 1.2)^\circ $ and $m_{\nu_1} = (4.8-8.4)$ meV for the Dirac CP phase and the lightest neutrino mass. We demonstrate how the model solves the strong CP problem via parity symmetry.</description>

      <title>$Z^\prime$ induced forward dominant processes in $\mu$TRISTAN experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) is a well motivated beyond the Standard Model(BSM) scenario where three generations of right handed neutrinos (RHNs) are introduced to cancel gauge and mixed gauge-gravity anomalies. After the $U(1)_X$ is broken, RHNs participate in the seesaw mechanism to generate light neutrino masses satisfying neutrino oscillation data. In addition to that, a neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved which interacts with the left and right handed fermions differently manifesting chiral nature of the model which could be probed in future collider experiments. As a result, if we consider $\mu^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collisions in $\mu$TRISTAN experiment $Z^\prime$ mediated $2\to2$ scattering will appear in $t-$ and $u-$channels depending on the initial and final states being accompanied by the photon and $Z$ mediated interactions. This will result well motivated resulting forward dominant scenarios giving rise to sizable left-right asymmetry. Estimating constrains on general $U(1)$ coupling from LEP-II and LHC for different $U(1)_X$ charges, we calculate differential and integrated scattering cross section and left-right asymmetry for $\mu^+ e^- \to \mu^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \mu^+ \mu^+$ processes which could be probed at $\mu$TRISTAN experiment further enlightening the interaction between $Z^\prime$ and charged leptons and the $U(1)_X$ breaking scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the negative polarized gluon distribution $\Delta g$ found in a recent global next-to-leading order QCD analysis of the nucleon helicity structure is incompatible with the fundamental requirement that physical cross-sections must not be negative. Specifically, we show that the fact that this polarized gluon strongly violates the positivity condition $|\Delta g|\leq g$ in terms of the unpolarized gluon distribution $g$ leads to negative cross-sections for Higgs boson production at RHIC as a physical process, implying that this negative $\Delta g$ is unphysical.</description>

      <title>QCD parameters and SM-high precision from $e^+e^-$ to Hadrons: Updated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1. I update my previous comparison of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly with the new measurement and found $\Delta a_\mu\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_\mu^{th} = (143\pm 42_{th}\pm 22_{exp})\times 10^{-11}$ indicating about 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the SM predictions and experiment. 2. I improve the estimate of QCD power corrections up to dimension D=12 and provide a new estimate of the ones up to D=20 within the SVZ expansion by combining the ratio of the Borel/Laplace sum rules (LSR) with the BNP $\tau$-like decay moments for the I=1 vector current. The results summarized in Table 1 confirm a violation of the factorization of the four-quark condensates and the value of the gluon one $ &lt;\alpha_s G^2&gt;$ from some other sources. Up to D=20, I do not observe any factorial nor exponential growth of the size of these power corrections. 3. I use these new values of power corrections to extract $\alpha_s$ from the BNP lowest moment. To order $\alpha_s^4$, I find within the SVZ expansion: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)= 0.3081(50)_{fit}(71)_{\alpha_s^5}$ [resp. $0.3260 (47)_{fit}(62)_{\alpha_s^5}]$ implying $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1170(6)(3)_{evol}$ [resp. $0.1192(6)(3)_{evol}$] for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour Improved (CI)] PT series. They lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{SVZ}=0.3179(58)_{fit}(81)_{syst}$ and $ \alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{SVZ}= 0.1182(12)(3)_{evol}$ where the systematic error(syst) takes into account the discrepancy between FO and CI. Using the lowest BNP moment, we also obtain from the $V+A$ component of $\tau$-decay: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.3040(76)_{fit}(68)_{syst}$ giving: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{\tau,V+A}=0.1166(8)(3)_{evol}$. The average of the two determinations leads to: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3099(60)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1174(10)(3)_{evol}$. 4. Some contributions beyond the SVZ expansion ($1/Q^2$, instantons and duality violation) are discussed in Sections 10,11.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we research into the anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment (CMDM), denoted as $\hat{\mu}_{q}^{BLHM}$, of the light quarks $q=(u, c, d, s, b)$ within the framework of the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM) as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). Our investigation encompasses novel interactions among the light quarks, the heavy quark $B$, and the heavy bosons $(W^{\prime\pm}, H^{\pm}, \phi^{\pm}, \eta^{\pm})$, incorporating the extended Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix characteristic of the BLHM. We thoroughly explore the permissible parameter space, yielding a spectrum of CMDM values ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Gauge Group, SMEFT, and Generalized Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss heavy particles that can be used to pin down the faithful Standard Model (SM) gauge group and their patterns in the SM effective field theory (SMEFT). These heavy particles are not invariant under a specific $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which however acts trivially on all the SM particles, hence the faithful SM gauge group remains undetermined. Different realizations of the faithful SM gauge group correspond to different spectra of heavy particles, and they also correspond to distinct sets of line operators with one-form global symmetry acting on them. We show that the heavy particles not invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group cannot appear in tree-level ultraviolet completions of SMEFT, this enforces us to consider one-loop UV completions of SMEFT to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. We demonstrate with examples that correlations between Wilson coefficients provide an efficient way to examine models with $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. Finally, we prove that all the scalars that can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking must be invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group, hence they cannot be used to probe the faithful SM gauge group.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore an extension of the Standard Model designed to elucidate the fermion mass hierarchy, account for the dark matter relic abundance, and explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Beyond the Standard Model particle content, our model introduces additional scalars and fermions. Notably, the light active neutrinos and the first two generations of charged fermions acquire masses at the one-loop level. The model accommodates successful low-scale leptogenesis, permitting the mass of the decaying heavy right-handed neutrino to be as low as 10 TeV. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dark matter phenomenology and explore various interesting phenomenological implications. These include charged lepton flavor violation, muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, constraints arising from electroweak precision observables, and implications for collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Frequency space derivation of linear and non-linear memory gravitational wave signals from eccentric binary orbits</title>

Abstract: The memory effect in gravitational wave (GW) signals is the phenomenon, wherein the relative position of two inertial GW detectors undergoes a permanent displacement owing to the passage of GWs through them. Measurement of the memory signal is an important target for future observations as it establishes a connection between observations with field-theoretic results like the soft-graviton theorems. Theoretically, the memory signal is predicted at the leading order quadrupole formula for sources like binaries in hyperbolic orbits. This can be in the realm of observations by Advanced LIGO, Einstein-Telescope, or LISA for black-holes with masses $\sim$ $O(10^3 \, M_\odot$) scattered by the super-massive black-hole at the galactic center. Apart from the direct memory component there is a non-linear memory signal in the secondary GW emitted from the primary GW chirp-signals emitted by coalescing binaries. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum using the field-theoretic method by computing the scattering amplitudes for eccentric elliptical and hyperbolic binary orbits. The field theoretic calculation gives us the gravitational waveforms of linear and non-linear memory signals directly in the frequency space. The frequency domain templates are useful for extracting signals from the data. We compare our results with other calculations of linear and non-linear memory signals in literature and point out novel features we find in our calculations like the presence of $\log(\omega)$ terms in the linear memory from hyperbolic orbits.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a cosmic neutrino background has been inferred indirectly from cosmological surveys through its effect on the linear-theory evolution of primordial density perturbations, as well as from measurements of the primordial abundances of light elements. Constraints on the masses of the three neutrino species imply that at least two of them move non-relativistically today. As a consequence, non-linear evolution of density perturbations results in the formation of neutrino halos around dark-matter halos. We study whether these neutrino halos can be detected in the foreseeable future through measurements of weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background, thus providing, possibly, the first beyond-linear-theory signature of cosmic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. Central to this proposal is the result that in a $4+n$ dimensional theory with $n$ compact dimensions a tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states contributes an amount $m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ to the vacuum energy $\rho_4$, where $m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the KK scale of the tower. We show that the result $\rho_4 \sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ comes from a mistreatment of the asymptotics of the loop momenta in the $4+n$ original theory. When the latter are correctly treated, new UV-sensitive terms appear in $\rho_4$ that invalidate the prediction of the dark dimension. We also show that, despite recent claims to the contrary, it is always possible to perform consistent effective field theory calculations that include only a finite number of tower states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present improved estimates of the electric charge that black holes could hold when these are embedded in the ionised plasma within galaxies. We have implemented the spontaneous emission of charges of opposite sign to that of the black hole via athermal Hawking evaporation, including its dependence on black hole spin, and we have estimated the equilibrium charge that arises as this charge loss is balanced by the continuous accretion of charges from the surrounding plasma. The resulting charge can be several orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated upper limits, but it can surpass the pair production limit noted by Gibbons (1974) by a margin that increases with the amplitude of the black hole spin and the density of the plasma. We also implement a calculation for the net charge of galaxies due to their stellar black holes and to primordial black holes in the case these make up a fraction of the dark matter. We find that these charges lie within the range that would produce adequate magnetic field seeds at the onset of galaxy formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory - have recently been the subject of active investigations. In this letter we describe an unanticipated wider implication of this work: the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory secretly contains Non-linear Sigma Model (NLSM) amplitudes to all loop orders. The NLSM amplitudes are obtained from Tr$(\Phi^3)$ amplitudes by a unique shift of kinematic variables. We show that this shifted kinematics produces amplitudes for a cubic theory with a linear term in potential, with extrema spontaneously breaking $U(N) \to U(N-k) \times U(k)$. The Goldstone amplitudes for this theory coincide with those of pions in the $U(N) \times U(N) \to U(N)$ chiral Lagrangian to all orders in the planar limit. We also give a purely on-shell understanding of this correspondence, showing integrands defined by the kinematic shifts have the correct residues on poles and appropriately produce the Adler zero. Finally, we discuss how similar kinematic shifts produce certain infinite classes of mixed amplitudes of pions and Tr($\Phi^3$) scalars, most of which are not interpretable from the Lagrangian description.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We compute the spectra associated with various semiclassical string states that propagate over $\mathcal{N}=2$ Gaiotto-Maldacena backgrounds. As an interesting special case, for the Abelian T- dual solution, we discover giant magnon and single spike configurations while imposing appropriate boundary conditions. However, for Sfetsos-Thompson backgrounds, one has to adopt a different string embedding which reveals ``modified'' dispersion relations both for magnons and spikes. These results boil down into the standard dispersion relations in the limit when the rank of the associated $SU(N_c)$ color gauge group becomes large enough. We further generalize our analysis in the presence of flavor D6 branes. Our analysis reveals a new set of dispersion relations, which shows that both magnons and spikes are ceased to exist in the presence of flavor excitations.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>
