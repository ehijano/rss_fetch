      <title>Extracting Inter-Protein Interactions Via Multitasking Graph Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPI) is crucial for gaining in-depth insights into numerous biological processes within cells and holds significant guiding value in areas such as drug development and disease treatment. Currently, most PPI prediction methods focus primarily on the study of protein sequences, neglecting the critical role of the internal structure of proteins. This paper proposes a novel PPI prediction method named MgslaPPI, which utilizes graph attention to mine protein structural information and enhances the expressive power of the protein encoder through multitask learning strategy. Specifically, we decompose the end-to-end PPI prediction process into two stages: amino acid residue reconstruction (A2RR) and protein interaction prediction (PIP). In the A2RR stage, we employ a graph attention-based residue reconstruction method to explore the internal relationships and features of proteins. In the PIP stage, in addition to the basic interaction prediction task, we introduce two auxiliary tasks, i.e., protein feature reconstruction (PFR) and masked interaction prediction (MIP). The PFR task aims to reconstruct the representation of proteins in the PIP stage, while the MIP task uses partially masked protein features for PPI prediction, with both working in concert to prompt MgslaPPI to capture more useful information. Experimental results demonstrate that MgslaPPI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under various data partitioning schemes.</description>

      <title>High Throughput Screening of Expression Constructs using Microcapillary Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression is a complex phenomenon involving numerous interlinked variables, and studying these variables to control expression is essential in bioengineering and biomanufacturing. While cloning techniques for achieving plasmid libraries that cover large design spaces exist, multiplex techniques offering cell culture screening at similar scales are still lacking. We introduced a microcapillary array-based platform aimed at high-throughput, multiplex screening of miniature cell cultures through fluorescent reporters.</description>

      <title>A technical review of multi-omics data integration methods: from classical statistical to deep generative approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing and other assay technologies has resulted in the generation of large and complex multi-omics datasets, offering unprecedented opportunities for advancing precision medicine strategies. However, multi-omics data integration presents significant challenges due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, experimental gaps, and frequency of missing values across data types. Computational methods have been developed to address these issues, employing statistical and machine learning approaches to uncover complex biological patterns and provide deeper insights into our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively review state-of-the-art multi-omics data integration methods with a focus on deep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) that have been widely used for data imputation and augmentation, joint embedding creation, and batch effect correction. We explore the technical aspects of loss functions and regularisation techniques including adversarial training, disentanglement and contrastive learning. Moreover, we discuss recent advancements in foundation models and the integration of emerging data modalities, while describing the current limitations and outlining future directions for enhancing multi-modal methodologies in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>IRONMAP: Iron Network Mapping and Analysis Protocol for Detecting Over-Time Brain Iron Abnormalities in Neurological Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathologically altered iron levels, detected using iron-sensitive MRI techniques such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), are observed in neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and may play a crucial role in disease pathophysiology. However, brain iron changes occur slowly, even in neurological diseases, and can be influenced by physiological factors such as diet. Therefore, novel analysis methods are needed to improve sensitivity to disease-related iron changes as compared to conventional region-based analysis methods. This study introduces IRONMAP, Iron Network Mapping and Analysis Protocol, which is a novel network-based analysis method to evaluate over-time changes in magnetic susceptibility. With this novel methodology, we analyzed short-term (&lt;1 year) longitudinal QSM data from a cohort of individuals with MS (pwMS) and healthy controls (HCs) and assessed disease-related network patterns, comparing the new approach to a conventional per-region rate-of-change method. IRONMAP analysis was able to detect over-time, MS-related brain iron abnormalities that were undetectable using the rate-of-change approach. IRONMAP was applicable on the per-subject level, improving binary classification of pwMS vs HCs compared to rate-of-change data alone (areas under the curve: 0.773 vs 0.636, p = 0.024). Further analysis revealed that the observed IRONMAP-derived HC network structure closely aligned with simulated networks based on healthy aging-related susceptibility data, suggesting that disruptions in normal aging-related iron changes may contribute to the network differences seen in pwMS. IRONMAP is generalizable to any neurological disease, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may allow for study of brain iron abnormalities over shorter timeframes than previously possible.</description>

      <title>An SIRS-model considering waning efficiency and periodic re-vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the classical SIRS (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible) model from mathematical epidemiology by incorporating a vaccinated compartment, V, accounting for an imperfect vaccine with waning efficacy over time. The SIRSV-model divides the population into four compartments and introduces periodic re-vaccination for waning immunity. The efficiency of the vaccine is assumed to decay with the time passed since the vaccination. Periodic re-vaccinations are applied to the population. We develop a partial differential equation (PDE) model for the continuous vaccination time and a coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) system when discretizing the vaccination period. We analyze the equilibria of the ODE model and investigate the linear stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Furthermore, we explore an optimization framework where vaccination rate, re-vaccination time, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are control variables to minimize infection levels. The optimization objective is defined using different norm-based measures of infected individuals. A numerical analysis of the model's dynamic behavior under varying control parameters is conducted using path-following methods. The analysis focuses on the impacts of vaccination strategies and contact limitation measures. Bifurcation analysis reveals complex behaviors, including bistability, fold bifurcations, forward and backward bifurcations, highlighting the need for combined vaccination and contact control strategies to manage disease spread effectively.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning in Distributed Medical Databases: Meta-Analysis of Large-Scale Subcortical Brain Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.08553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At this moment, databanks worldwide contain brain images of previously unimaginable numbers. Combined with developments in data science, these massive data provide the potential to better understand the genetic underpinnings of brain diseases. However, different datasets, which are stored at different institutions, cannot always be shared directly due to privacy and legal concerns, thus limiting the full exploitation of big data in the study of brain disorders. Here we propose a federated learning framework for securely accessing and meta-analyzing any biomedical data without sharing individual information. We illustrate our framework by investigating brain structural relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts. The framework is first tested on synthetic data and then applied to multi-centric, multi-database studies including ADNI, PPMI, MIRIAD and UK Biobank, showing the potential of the approach for further applications in distributed analysis of multi-centric cohorts</description>
