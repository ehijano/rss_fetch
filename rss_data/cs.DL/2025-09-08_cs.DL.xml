      <title>Beyond Productivity Gaps: Temporal Patterns of Gender Differences in Scientific Knowledge Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender inequality in scientific careers has been extensively documented through aggregate measures such as total publications and cumulative citations, yet the temporal dynamics underlying these disparities remain largely unexplored. Here we developed a multi-dimensional framework to examine gender differences in scientific knowledge creation through three complementary temporal dimensions: stability (consistency of performance over time), volatility (degree of year-to-year fluctuation), and persistence (ability to maintain high performance for extended periods). Using comprehensive bibliometric data from SciSciNet covering 62.5 million authors whose careers began between 1960-2010, we constructed knowledge creation capability measures that captured how scientists absorb knowledge from diverse sources and contribute to field advancement. We found that female scientists demonstrated significantly higher knowledge production stability (0.170 vs. 0.119 for males) while simultaneously exhibiting greater year-to-year volatility (6.606 vs. 6.228), revealing a striking paradox in career dynamics. Female scientists showed persistence advantages under moderate performance requirements but faced disadvantages under extreme criteria demanding sustained peak performance. However, these patterns varied substantially across disciplines, with female advantages strongest in humanities and social sciences while STEM fields show mixed results.</description>

      <title>Synergy, not size: How collaboration architecture shapes scientific disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms driving different types of scientific innovation through collaboration remain poorly understood. Here we develop a comprehensive framework analyzing over 14 million papers across 19 disciplines from 1960 to 2020 to unpack how collaborative synergy shapes research disruption. We introduce the synergy factor to quantify collaboration cost-benefit dynamics, revealing discipline-specific architectures where Physics peaks at medium team sizes while humanities achieve maximal synergy through individual scholarship. Our mediation analysis demonstrates that collaborative synergy, not team size alone, mediates 75% of the relationship between team composition and disruption. Key authors play a catalytic role, with papers featuring exceptional researchers showing 561% higher disruption indices. Surprisingly, high-citation authors reduce disruptive potential while those with breakthrough track records enhance it, challenging traditional evaluation metrics. We identify four distinct knowledge production modes: elite-driven, baseline, heterogeneity-driven, and low-cost. These findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in optimal collaboration strategies across disciplines and provide evidence-based guidance for research organization, with implications for science policy and the design of research institutions in an increasingly collaborative scientific landscape.</description>

      <title>Compare: A Framework for Scientific Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating the vast and rapidly increasing sea of academic publications to identify institutional synergies, benchmark research contributions and pinpoint key research contributions has become an increasingly daunting task, especially with the current exponential increase in new publications. Existing tools provide useful overviews or single-document insights, but none supports structured, qualitative comparisons across institutions or publications.
  To address this, we demonstrate Compare, a novel framework that tackles this challenge by enabling sophisticated long-context comparisons of scientific contributions. Compare empowers users to explore and analyze research overlaps and differences at both the institutional and publication granularity, all driven by user-defined questions and automatic retrieval over online resources. For this we leverage on Retrieval-Augmented Generation over evolving data sources to foster long context knowledge synthesis. Unlike traditional scientometric tools, Compare goes beyond quantitative indicators by providing qualitative, citation-supported comparisons.</description>

      <title>Using Artificial Intuition in Distinct, Minimalist Classification of Scientific Abstracts for Management of Technology Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues. Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other strategic activities.</description>
