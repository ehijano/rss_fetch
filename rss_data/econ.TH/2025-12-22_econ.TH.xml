      <title>From Aggregate Observations to Social Optimum: An Adaptive Pricing Scheme in Heterogeneous Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates an adaptive pricing scheme aimed at achieving an efficient state in a traffic congestion game characterized by a diverse population of road users. While the planner possesses knowledge of players' preferences, their ability to observe only aggregate states limits the implementation of differentiated taxes. We propose a pricing approach that aligns taxes with the true values of externalities over time, ensuring global stability of the social optimum through replicator dynamics. Our findings suggest that the planner, despite being unable to accurately assess externalities at each moment, can still navigate the economy toward a long-term social optimum by adjusting the disaggregated state based on aggregate observations, while acknowledging the challenges posed by heterogeneous value of time (VOT) among drivers. We also find that a pricing mechanism that incorporates the current externalities for each period, which could be executed by a planner with full access to the disaggregated state, might fail to achieve the global stability of the social optimum under the same dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Schumpeterian games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of a change in diversity introduced by a new product on the evolution of an economic system. Modeling Schumpeterian competition as a population game with a unique, attracting, evolutionarily stable state (the Schumpeterian state), in which both innovators and imitators coexist, we examine how the Schumpeterian state evolves depending on the properties of the new product developed by innovators. This way, we demonstrate that the change in diversity is one of the spiritus movens of innovation, influencing the process of creative destruction.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mechanism design when a designer repeatedly uses a fixed mechanism to interact with strategic agents who learn from observing their allocations. We introduce a static framework, calibrated mechanism design, requiring mechanisms to remain incentive compatible given the information they reveal about an underlying state through repeated use. In single-agent settings, we prove implementable outcomes correspond to two-stage mechanisms: the designer discloses information about the state, then commits to a state-independent allocation rule. This yields a tractable procedure to characterize calibrated mechanisms, combining information design and mechanism design. In private values environments, full transparency is optimal and correlation-based surplus extraction fails. We provide a microfoundation by showing calibrated mechanisms characterize exactly what is implementable when an infinitely patient agent repeatedly interacts with the same mechanism. Dynamic mechanisms that condition on histories expand implementable outcomes only by weakening incentive compatibility and individual rationality--a distinction that vanishes in transferable utility settings.</description>

      <title>Information Revelation in Constant-Sum Games: Elections and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-player constant-sum Bayesian games with type-independent payoffs. Under a "completeness" statistical condition, any "identifiable'" equilibrium is an ex-post equilibrium. We apply this result to a Downsian election in which office-motivated candidates possess private information about policy consequences. The ex-post property implies a sharp bound on information aggregation: equilibrium voter welfare is at best equal to the efficient use of a single candidate's information. In canonical specifications, politicians may "anti-pander" (overreact to their information), whereas some degree of pandering would be socially beneficial. We discuss other applications of the ex-post result.</description>

      <title>Raising Bidders' Awareness in Second-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When bidders bid on complex objects, they might be unaware of characteristics effecting their valuations. We assume that each buyer's valuation is a sum of independent random variables, one for each characteristic. When a bidder is unaware of a characteristic, he omits the random variable from the sum. We study the seller's decision to raise bidders' awareness of characteristics before a second-price auction with entry fees. Optimal entry fees capture an additional unawareness rent due to unaware bidders misperceiving their probability of winning and the price to be paid upon winning. When raising a bidder's individual awareness of a characteristic with positive expected value, the seller faces a trade-off between positive effects on the expected first order statistic and unawareness rents of remaining unaware bidders on one hand and the loss of the unawareness rent from the newly aware bidder on the other. We present characterization results on raising public awareness together with no versus full information. We discuss the winner's curse due to unawareness of characteristics.</description>
