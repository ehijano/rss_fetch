      <title>Strong convergence of random representations of free products of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the polynomial method of Chen--Garza-Vargas--Tropp--van Handel and Magee--Puder--van Handel for operator-norm bounds in random permutation models to the setting where torsion is present. The main new feature is that asymptotic expansion of traces naturally involves fractional powers of $N$ rather than an ordinary Laurent series. We formulate fractional-power analogues of the method's key hypotheses and prove they lead to strong convergence. We verify these analogues for free products of finite groups $\Gamma=G_1*\cdots*G_m$. Concretely, for a uniformly random $\phi_N\in{\rm hom}(\Gamma,{\rm Sym}(N))$, set $\pi_N = {\rm std} \circ \phi_N$, where ${\rm std}$ denotes the standard $(N-1)$-dimensional representation of ${\rm Sym}(N)$ (the permutation representation with the trivial subrepresentation removed). We deduce strong convergence of $\pi_N$ to the left regular representation of $\Gamma$. As applications, we obtain asymptotically sharp spectral gaps for the associated random Schreier graphs, including almost Ramanujan behavior for $C_2*C_2*C_2$ and an explicit non-Ramanujan limiting spectral radius for $C_2*C_3 \cong {\rm PSL}_2({\bf Z})$.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases of Burchnall-Chaundy ideals for ordinary differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators (ODOs) and algebraic curves was established by Burchnall and Chaundy, Krichever and Mumford, among many others. To make this correspondence computationally effective, in this paper we aim to compute the defining ideals of spectral curves, Burchnall-Chaundy (BC) ideals. We provide an algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis of a BC ideal. The point of departure is the computation of the finite set of generators of a maximal commutative ring of ODOs, which was implemented by the authors in the package dalgebra of SageMath. The algorithm to compute BC ideals has been also implemented in dalgebra.
  The differential Galois theory of the corresponding spectral problems, linear differential equations with parameters, would benefit from the computation on this prime ideal, generated by constant coefficient polynomials. In particular, we prove the primality of the differential ideal generated by a BC ideal, after extending the coefficient field. This is a fundamental result to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems.</description>

      <title>A family of matrix flows converging to normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Antezana-Pujals-Stojanoff Theorem states that the iterated Aluthge transforms of an arbitrary matrix converge to a normal matrix. We introduce a family of matrix flows that share this convergence property by defining them through ordinary differential equations. The family includes a continuous analogue of the Aluthge transform, as well as a differential equation discussed by Haagerup in the context of II$_1$ factors. We also examine the same type of flows in the setting of Hilbert space operators equipped with unitarily invariant norms.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Estimates of the Hodge Laplacian Under Lower Ricci Curvature Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish uniform lower and upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms on closed Riemannian manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound, a positive lower bound on the injectivity radius, and an upper bound on the diameter. Our results extend earlier work of Dodziuk, Lott, and Mantuano, which required bounded sectional curvature, to the broader setting of lower Ricci curvature bounds. As applications, we obtain uniform eigenvalue bounds for the connection Laplacian acting on $1$-forms and establish a global Poincar\'e inequality for differential forms under the same geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonances and zeta function at zero on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an orientable closed surface $(\Sigma,g)$ of genus $G$ with Anosov geodesic flow, we show the existence of an open subset $U_g$ of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the fundamental group of its unit tangent bundle, whose complement has complex codimension at least one and such that for any $\rho \in U_g$, the twisted Ruelle zeta function $\zeta_{g,\rho}(s)$ vanishes at $s=0$ to order ${\rm dim}(\rho)(2G-2)$ if $\rho$ factors through $\pi_1(\Sigma)$, and does not vanish otherwise. In the second case, we show that $\zeta_{g,\rho}(0)$ is given by the Reidemeister--Turaev torsion, thus extending Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (but not necessarily unitary) representations. Our proof relies on computing the dimensions of the spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonant states at zero for any $\rho\in U_g$.</description>

      <title>First variation of flat traces on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a closed negatively curved surface $(X,g)$ the flat trace of the geodesic Koopman operators $V_g^\tau f=f\circ G_g^\tau$ is the periodic orbit distribution \[ \mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g}(\tau)=\sum_{\gamma}\frac{L_\gamma^{\#}}{\lvert\det(I-P_\gamma)\rvert}\,\delta(\tau-L_\gamma), \qquad \tau&gt;0, \] supported on the length spectrum and weighted by the linearized Poincar\'e maps $P_\gamma$. For a smooth family of negatively curved metrics $g_t$ we compute the first variation $\partial_t\vert_{0}\,\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}$ as a distribution. At an isolated length $\ell$ the leading singularity is a multiple of $\delta'(\tau-\ell)$, and its coefficient is an explicit linear functional of the length variations $\dot L_{\gamma^m}$ of the closed geodesics with $L_{\gamma^m}=\ell$. This transport coefficient forces the marked lengths to be locally constant along any deformation with constant flat trace. As an application, if $\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}=\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_0}$ for all $t$ then $g_t$ is isometric to $g_0$ for all $t$. Together with Sunada-type constructions of non isometric pairs with equal flat traces, this shows that the flat trace is globally non-unique yet locally complete along smooth families.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for surfaces of infinite volume with negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the imaginary parts of scattering resonances for negatively curved asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces are uniformly bounded away from zero and provide a resolvent bound in the resulting resonance-free strip. This provides an essential spectral gap without the pressure condition. This is done by adapting the methods of [arXiv:1004.3361], [arXiv:1012.4391] and [arXiv:2201.08259] and answers a question posed in [arXiv:1504.06589].</description>
