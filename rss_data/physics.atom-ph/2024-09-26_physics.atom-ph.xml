      <title>Simulated optical molasses cooling of trapped antihydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the cooling of antihydrogen, $\bar{H}$, using optical molasses cooling. This updates the results in Ref. [1] to the current capabilities of the ALPHA experiment. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that $\bar{H}$s do not give the standard cooling even in an ideal optical molasses because of their small mass and large transition frequency. For optical molasses cooling in the ALPHA trap, the photons are constrained to travel in one direction only. It is only through the phase space mixing in the trap that cooling in all directions can be achieved. We explore the nontrivial role that laser intensity plays in the cooling. We also investigate the possibility for simultaneously cooling atoms in either of the trapped ground states.</description>

      <title>Ultracold Interactions between Ions and Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a platform for observing and controlling the interactions between atomic ions and a quantum gas of polar molecules in the ultracold regime. This approach is based on the combination of several recently developed methods in two so-far complementary research domains: ion-atom collisions and studies of ultracold polar molecules. In contrast to collisions between ions and ground-state atoms, which are dominated by losses due to three-body recombination (TBR) already at densities far below those typical for quantum degenerate ensembles, our proposal makes use of polar molecules, their rich level structure, and sensitivity to electric fields to design effective interaction potentials where ion-neutral TBR losses and molecule-molecule losses due to sticky collisions are strongly suppressed. This may enable access to the deep quantum regime of interaction with a broad range of applications including the potential formation of novel many-body self-bound states, quantum simulations, and quantum chemistry between polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Measurement of transition frequencies and hyperfine constants of molecular iodine at 520.2 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the transition frequencies of the hyperfine components in the four lines (P(34) 39-0, R(36) 39-0, P(33) 39-0, and R(35) 39-0) of the B-X transitions of molecular iodine at 520.2 nm. The 520.2 nm laser was generated by wavelength-converting the output of a 1560.6 nm external-cavity diode laser using a dual-pitch periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. The frequencies were measured by counting the heterodyne beats between the laser stabilized at the frequencies of the hyperfine components and a frequency comb synchronized with a hydrogen maser. We determined the transition frequencies of the a1 components with relative uncertainties of 1*10-11; the uncertainty was limited by the impurity of the molecular iodine in the cell. From the measured hyperfine splitting frequencies, we calculated the hyperfine constants of these four transitions to obtain the rotational dependence of the excited-state hyperfine constants.</description>

      <title>The effect of MgO insertion into the interstitial spaces of $BaY_2O_4$ on the upconversion response of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$ at illumination with 976 nm excitation light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16568</link>

Abstract: The efficiencies and form of the upconversion spectra of rare earth ions embedded in crystalline matrices strongly depend upon the phonon dispersion of these, since the inter-level energy transition probabilities are influenced by the phonon energies. The aim of this study is to show a novel method of influencing the phonon energy values of crystalline $BaY_2O_4$ and, by this, to finely tune the spectra of any rare earth ion as a dopant of it. We used $Er^{3+}$ sensitized by $Yb^{3+}$ as dopants, but the same method can be generalized for other kind of rare earth ions. As such, we synthesized $BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ ceramics having as activator-sensitizer pairs the $Er^{3+}$ 1% and $Yb^{3+}$ 2% relative to the substituted $Y^{3+}$. Firstly, we synthesized the mix of precursor metallic oxides by the citrate-gel method, pressed these into pellets, and sintered them to obtain doped crystalline ceramic samples. The ceramic samples were illuminated with 976 nm from a laser diode, and the resulting upconversion spectra of $Er^{3+}$ were measured. $BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ have almost the same XRD signature, showing that the crystal unit cells have the same parameters but they differ in the phononic energies due to the presence of the additional MgO. Comparing the results of these two extreme cases $BaY_2O_4$ vs. $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ reveals that the presence of the MgO modifies the upconversion response. So, this study fulfills two goals: First, it reveals the structure of the undocumented $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ and shows how it is based on the crystal structure of $BaY_2O_4$ with $Mg^{2+}$ ions occupying the unit cell interstitions. Secondly, it suggests a method of tuning the phononic energies of $BaY_2O_4$ and, as a consequence, the upconversion response of $Er^{3+}$.</description>

      <title>On the collisional sensitivity of polarized Mg II solar lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral and singly ionized states of the Magnesium (Mg) are the origin of several spectral lines that are useful for solar diagnostic purposes. An important element in modeling such solar lines is collisional data of the Mg with different perturbers abundant in the Sun, specially with neutral hydrogen. This work aims at providing complete depolarization and polarization and population transfer data for Mg II due to collisions with hydrogen atoms. For this purpose, a general formalism is employed to calculate the needed rates of MgII due to collisions with hydrogen atoms. The resulting collisional rates are then employed to investigate the impact of collisions on the polarization of 25 Mg II lines relevant to solar applications by solving the governing statistical equilibrium equations within multi-level and multi-term atomic models. We find that the polarization of some Mg II lines starts to be sensitive to collisions for hydrogen density $n_H \!\gtrsim\!$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Coulomb universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a number of realizations of long-range interacting systems, including ultra-cold atomic and molecular gases, we study a neutral plasma with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulombic. We find that beyond a crossover length, such interactions are universally screened down to a standard Coulomb form in all spatial dimensions. This implies, counter-intuitively, that in two dimensions and below, such a "super-Coulombic" gas is asymptotically Coulombically confining at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the plasma undergoes a deconfining transition that in two dimensions is the same Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that occurs in a conventional Coulomb gas, but at an elevated temperature that we calculate. We also predict that in contrast, above two dimensions, even when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, the super-Coulomb to Coulomb crossover is followed at longer length scales by an unconventional "Debye-Huckel" screening, which leads to faster-than-Coulombic, power-law decay of the screened potential, in contrast to the usual exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Furthermore, we show that power-law potentials, that fall off more rapidly than Coulomb, are screened down to a shorter-ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form. We expect these prediction to be testable in simulations, and hope they will inspire experimental studies in various platforms.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all couplings. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and theoretically and numerically demonstrate topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Ryd\-berg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9\%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling parameters.</description>
