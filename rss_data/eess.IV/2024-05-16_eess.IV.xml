      <title>Deep-learning-based clustering of OCT images for biomarker discovery in age-related macular degeneration (Pinnacle study report 4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diseases are currently managed by grading systems, where patients are stratified by grading systems into stages that indicate patient risk and guide clinical management. However, these broad categories typically lack prognostic value, and proposals for new biomarkers are currently limited to anecdotal observations. In this work, we introduce a deep-learning-based biomarker proposal system for the purpose of accelerating biomarker discovery in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It works by first training a neural network using self-supervised contrastive learning to discover, without any clinical annotations, features relating to both known and unknown AMD biomarkers present in 46,496 retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To interpret the discovered biomarkers, we partition the images into 30 subsets, termed clusters, that contain similar features. We then conduct two parallel 1.5-hour semi-structured interviews with two independent teams of retinal specialists that describe each cluster in clinical language. Overall, both teams independently identified clearly distinct characteristics in 27 of 30 clusters, of which 23 were related to AMD. Seven were recognised as known biomarkers already used in established grading systems and 16 depicted biomarker combinations or subtypes that are either not yet used in grading systems, were only recently proposed, or were unknown. Clusters separated incomplete from complete retinal atrophy, intraretinal from subretinal fluid and thick from thin choroids, and in simulation outperformed clinically-used grading systems in prognostic value. Overall, contrastive learning enabled the automatic proposal of AMD biomarkers that go beyond the set used by clinically established grading systems. Ultimately, we envision that equipping clinicians with discovery-oriented deep-learning tools can accelerate discovery of novel prognostic biomarkers.</description>

      <title>ODFormer: Semantic Fundus Image Segmentation Using Transformer for Optic Nerve Head Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optic nerve head (ONH) detection has been an important topic in the medical community for many years. Previous approaches in this domain primarily center on the analysis, localization, and detection of fundus images. However, the non-negligible discrepancy between fundus image datasets, all exclusively generated using a single type of fundus camera, challenges the generalizability of ONH detection approaches. Furthermore, despite the numerous recent semantic segmentation methods employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, there is currently a lack of benchmarks for these state-of-the-art (SoTA) networks trained specifically for ONH detection. Therefore, in this article, we first introduce ODFormer, a network based on the Swin Transformer architecture. ODFormer is designed to enhance the extraction of correlation information between features, leading to improved generalizability. In our experimental evaluations, we compare our top-performing implementation with 13 SoTA CNNs and Transformers. The results indicate that our proposed ODFormer outperforms all other approaches in ONH detection. Subsequently, we release TongjiU-DCOD dataset, the first multi-resolution mixed fundus image dataset with corresponding ONH ground-truth annotations. This dataset comprises 400 fundus images captured using two different types of fundus cameras with varying resolutions. This diversity enhances the availability of data regularity information, contributing to the improved generalizability of the model. Moreover, we establish a benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the performance for ONH detection of SoTA networks designed for semantic segmentation with extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Computer aided diagnosis system for Alzheimers disease using principal component analysis and machine learning based approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a severe neurological brain disorder. It is not curable, but earlier detection can help improve symptoms in a great deal. The machine learning based approaches are popular and well motivated models for medical image processing tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis. These techniques can improve the process for accurate diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we investigate the performance of these techniques for AD detection and classification using brain MRI and PET images from the OASIS database. The proposed system takes advantage of the artificial neural network and support vector machines as classifiers, and principal component analysis as a feature extraction technique. The results indicate that the combined scheme achieves good accuracy and offers a significant advantage over the other approaches.</description>

      <title>Factual Serialization Enhancement: A Key Innovation for Chest X-ray Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of writing imaging reports is a valuable tool for alleviating the workload of radiologists. Crucial steps in this process involve the cross-modal alignment between medical images and reports, as well as the retrieval of similar historical cases. However, the presence of presentation-style vocabulary (e.g., sentence structure and grammar) in reports poses challenges for cross-modal alignment. Additionally, existing methods for similar historical cases retrieval face suboptimal performance owing to the modal gap issue. In response, this paper introduces a novel method, named Factual Serialization Enhancement (FSE), for chest X-ray report generation. FSE begins with the structural entities approach to eliminate presentation-style vocabulary in reports, providing specific input for our model. Then, uni-modal features are learned through cross-modal alignment between images and factual serialization in reports. Subsequently, we present a novel approach to retrieve similar historical cases from the training set, leveraging aligned image features. These features implicitly preserve semantic similarity with their corresponding reference reports, enabling us to calculate similarity solely among aligned features. This effectively eliminates the modal gap issue for knowledge retrieval without the requirement for disease labels. Finally, the cross-modal fusion network is employed to query valuable information from these cases, enriching image features and aiding the text decoder in generating high-quality reports. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-ray datasets from both specific and general scenarios demonstrate the superiority of FSE over state-of-the-art approaches in both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Medical Image Representations through Image-Graph Contrastive Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image interpretation using deep learning has shown promise but often requires extensive expert-annotated datasets. To reduce this annotation burden, we develop an Image-Graph Contrastive Learning framework that pairs chest X-rays with structured report knowledge graphs automatically extracted from radiology notes. Our approach uniquely encodes the disconnected graph components via a relational graph convolution network and transformer attention. In experiments on the CheXpert dataset, this novel graph encoding strategy enabled the framework to outperform existing methods that use image-text contrastive learning in 1% linear evaluation and few-shot settings, while achieving comparable performance to radiologists. By exploiting unlabeled paired images and text, our framework demonstrates the potential of structured clinical insights to enhance contrastive learning for medical images. This work points toward reducing demands on medical experts for annotations, improving diagnostic precision, and advancing patient care through robust medical image understanding.</description>

      <title>Illumination Histogram Consistency Metric for Quantitative Assessment of Video Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances in deep generative models have greatly accelerate the process of video procession such as video enhancement and synthesis. Learning spatio-temporal video models requires to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual appearance of individual frames. Illumination consistency, which reflects the variations of illumination in the dynamic video sequences, play a vital role in video processing. Unfortunately, to date, no well-accepted quantitative metric has been proposed for video illumination consistency evaluation. In this paper, we propose a illumination histogram consistency (IHC) metric to quantitatively and automatically evaluate the illumination consistency of the video sequences. IHC measures the illumination variation of any video sequence based on the illumination histogram discrepancies across all the frames in the video sequence. Specifically, given a video sequence, we first estimate the illumination map of each individual frame using the Retinex model; Then, using the illumination maps, the mean illumination histogram of the video sequence is computed by the mean operation across all the frames; Next, we compute the illumination histogram discrepancy between each individual frame and the mean illumination histogram and sum up all the illumination histogram discrepancies to represent the illumination variations of the video sequence. Finally, we obtain the IHC score from the illumination histogram discrepancies via normalization and subtraction operations. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed IHC metric and its capability to measure the illumination variations in video sequences.

      <title>Analysis of the BraTS 2023 Intracranial Meningioma Segmentation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design and results from the BraTS 2023 Intracranial Meningioma Segmentation Challenge. The BraTS Meningioma Challenge differed from prior BraTS Glioma challenges in that it focused on meningiomas, which are typically benign extra-axial tumors with diverse radiologic and anatomical presentation and a propensity for multiplicity. Nine participating teams each developed deep-learning automated segmentation models using image data from the largest multi-institutional systematically expert annotated multilabel multi-sequence meningioma MRI dataset to date, which included 1000 training set cases, 141 validation set cases, and 283 hidden test set cases. Each case included T2, T2/FLAIR, T1, and T1Gd brain MRI sequences with associated tumor compartment labels delineating enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and surrounding non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Participant automated segmentation models were evaluated and ranked based on a scoring system evaluating lesion-wise metrics including dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The top ranked team had a lesion-wise median dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.976, 0.976, and 0.964 for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively and a corresponding average DSC of 0.899, 0.904, and 0.871, respectively. These results serve as state-of-the-art benchmarks for future pre-operative meningioma automated segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we found that 1286 of 1424 cases (90.3%) had at least 1 compartment voxel abutting the edge of the skull-stripped image edge, which requires further investigation into optimal pre-processing face anonymization steps.</description>

      <title>Region of Interest Detection in Melanocytic Skin Tumor Whole Slide Images -- Nevus &amp; Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact on clinical practice. The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology may help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis. We started with the UNC Melanocytic Tumor Dataset cohort that contains 160 hematoxylin and eosin whole-slide images of primary melanomas (86) and nevi (74). We randomly assigned 80% (134) as a training set and built an in-house deep-learning method to allow for classification, at the slide level, of nevi and melanomas. The proposed method performed well on the other 20% (26) test dataset; the accuracy of the slide classification task was 92.3% and our model also performed well in terms of predicting the region of interest annotated by the pathologists, showing excellent performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumors. Even though we tested the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems to benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.</description>

      <title>Confidence Estimation in Unsupervised Deep Change Vector Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised transfer learning-based change detection methods exploit the feature extraction capability of pre-trained networks to distinguish changed pixels from the unchanged ones. However, their performance may vary significantly depending on several geographical and model-related aspects. In many applications, it is of utmost importance to provide trustworthy or confident results, even if over a subset of pixels. The core challenge in this problem is to identify changed pixels and confident pixels in an unsupervised manner. To address this, we propose a two-network model - one tasked with mere change detection and the other with confidence estimation. While the change detection network can be used in conjunction with popular transfer learning-based change detection methods such as Deep Change Vector Analysis, the confidence estimation network operates similarly to a randomized smoothing model. By ingesting ensembles of inputs perturbed by noise, it creates a distribution over the output and assigns confidence to each pixel's outcome. We tested the proposed method on three different Earth observation sensors: optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar, and hyperspectral sensors.</description>

      <title>Patient-Specific Real-Time Segmentation in Trackerless Brain Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) imaging has the potential to improve surgical outcomes in brain surgery. However, its interpretation is challenging, even for expert neurosurgeons. In this work, we designed the first patient-specific framework that performs brain tumor segmentation in trackerless iUS. To disambiguate ultrasound imaging and adapt to the neurosurgeon's surgical objective, a patient-specific real-time network is trained using synthetic ultrasound data generated by simulating virtual iUS sweep acquisitions in pre-operative MR data. Extensive experiments performed in real ultrasound data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, allowing for adapting to the surgeon's definition of surgical targets and outperforming non-patient-specific models, neurosurgeon experts, and high-end tracking systems. Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/ReubenDo/MHVAE-Seg}.</description>

      <title>Histopathology Foundation Models Enable Accurate Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show promise across many tasks, but analyses have been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task/dataset. We report the most rigorous single-task validation conducted to date of a histopathology foundation model, and the first performed in ovarian cancer subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using vision transformer and ResNet features generated through varied preprocessing and pretraining procedures. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Hospitals. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for evaluation on a hold-out test set and an external set from the Transcanadian study. Reporting followed the TRIPOD+AI checklist. The vision transformer-based histopathology foundation model, UNI, performed best in every evaluation, with five-class balanced accuracies of 88% and 93% in hold-out internal and external testing, compared to the best ResNet model scores of 68% and 81%, respectively. Normalisations and augmentations aided the generalisability of ResNet-based models, but these still did not match the performance of UNI, which gave the best external performance in any ovarian cancer subtyping study to date. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion in challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</description>

      <title>ROCOv2: Radiology Objects in COntext Version 2, an Updated Multimodal Image Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated medical image analysis systems often require large amounts of training data with high quality labels, which are difficult and time consuming to generate. This paper introduces Radiology Object in COntext version 2 (ROCOv2), a multimodal dataset consisting of radiological images and associated medical concepts and captions extracted from the PMC Open Access subset. It is an updated version of the ROCO dataset published in 2018, and adds 35,705 new images added to PMC since 2018. It further provides manually curated concepts for imaging modalities with additional anatomical and directional concepts for X-rays. The dataset consists of 79,789 images and has been used, with minor modifications, in the concept detection and caption prediction tasks of ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2023. The dataset is suitable for training image annotation models based on image-caption pairs, or for multi-label image classification using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts provided with each image. In addition, it can serve for pre-training of medical domain models, and evaluation of deep learning models for multi-task learning.</description>

      <title>MrRegNet: Multi-resolution Mask Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Registration with Large Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable image registration (alignment) is highly sought after in numerous clinical applications, such as computer aided diagnosis and disease progression analysis. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)-based image registration methods have demonstrated advantages in terms of registration accuracy and computational speed. However, while most methods excel at global alignment, they often perform worse in aligning local regions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a mask-guided encoder-decoder DCNN-based image registration method, named as MrRegNet. This approach employs a multi-resolution encoder for feature extraction and subsequently estimates multi-resolution displacement fields in the decoder to handle the substantial deformation of images. Furthermore, segmentation masks are employed to direct the model's attention toward aligning local regions. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods like Demons and a well-known deep learning method, VoxelMorph, on a public 3D brain MRI dataset (OASIS) and a local 2D brain MRI dataset with large deformations. Importantly, the image alignment accuracies are significantly improved at local regions guided by segmentation masks. Github link:https://github.com/ruizhe-l/MrRegNet.</description>

      <title>Introducing Learning Rate Adaptation CMA-ES into Rigid 2D/3D Registration for Robotic Navigation in Spine Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has been widely used in the field of 2D/3D registration in recent years. This optimization method exhibits exceptional robustness and usability for complex surgical scenarios. However, due to the inherent ill-posed nature of the 2D/3D registration task and the presence of numerous local minima in the landscape of similarity measures. Evolution strategies often require a larger population size in each generation in each generation to ensure the stability of registration and the globality and effectiveness of search, which makes the entire process computationally expensive. In this paper, we build a 2D/3D registration framework based on a learning rate adaptation CMA-ES manner. The framework employs a fixed and small population size, leading to minimized runtime and optimal utilization of computing resources. We conduct experimental comparisons between the proposed framework and other intensity-based baselines using a substantial volume of synthetic data. The results suggests that our method demonstrates superiority in both registration accuracy and running time. Code is available at github.com/m1nhengChen/CMAES-reg.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Multi-Modal Generative Foundation Model for Slide-Level Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models in computational pathology promise to unlock the development of new clinical decision support systems and models for precision medicine. However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&amp;E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</description>

      <title>AD-Aligning: Emulating Human-like Generalization for Cognitive Domain Adaptation in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation is pivotal for enabling deep learning models to generalize across diverse domains, a task complicated by variations in presentation and cognitive nuances. In this paper, we introduce AD-Aligning, a novel approach that combines adversarial training with source-target domain alignment to enhance generalization capabilities. By pretraining with Coral loss and standard loss, AD-Aligning aligns target domain statistics with those of the pretrained encoder, preserving robustness while accommodating domain shifts. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and domain shift scenarios, including noise-induced shifts and cognitive domain adaptation tasks, we demonstrate AD-Aligning's superior performance compared to existing methods such as Deep Coral and ADDA. Our findings highlight AD-Aligning's ability to emulate the nuanced cognitive processes inherent in human perception, making it a promising solution for real-world applications requiring adaptable and robust domain adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>IRSRMamba: Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Mamba-based Wavelet Transform Feature Modulation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) image super-resolution faces challenges from homogeneous background pixel distributions and sparse target regions, requiring models that effectively handle long-range dependencies and capture detailed local-global information. Recent advancements in Mamba-based (Selective Structured State Space Model) models, employing state space models, have shown significant potential in visual tasks, suggesting their applicability for IR enhancement. In this work, we introduce IRSRMamba: Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Mamba-based Wavelet Transform Feature Modulation Model, a novel Mamba-based model designed specifically for IR image super-resolution. This model enhances the restoration of context-sparse target details through its advanced dependency modeling capabilities. Additionally, a new wavelet transform feature modulation block improves multi-scale receptive field representation, capturing both global and local information efficiently. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that IRSRMamba outperforms existing models on multiple benchmarks. This research advances IR super-resolution and demonstrates the potential of Mamba-based models in IR image processing.

      <description>arXiv:2405.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the NTIRE 2024 challenge on Restore Any Image Model (RAIM) in the Wild. The RAIM challenge constructed a benchmark for image restoration in the wild, including real-world images with/without reference ground truth in various scenarios from real applications. The participants were required to restore the real-captured images from complex and unknown degradation, where generative perceptual quality and fidelity are desired in the restoration result. The challenge consisted of two tasks. Task one employed real referenced data pairs, where quantitative evaluation is available. Task two used unpaired images, and a comprehensive user study was conducted. The challenge attracted more than 200 registrations, where 39 of them submitted results with more than 400 submissions. Top-ranked methods improved the state-of-the-art restoration performance and obtained unanimous recognition from all 18 judges. The proposed datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DqbxUoiUqkAIkExu3jZAqoElr_nu1IXb/view?usp=sharing and the homepage of this challenge is at https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/17632.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Refinement with Multiscale Diffusion for Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of single image super-resolution depends heavily on how to generate and complement high-frequency details to low-resolution images. Recently, diffusion-based models exhibit great potential in generating high-quality images for super-resolution tasks. However, existing models encounter difficulties in directly predicting high-frequency information of wide bandwidth by solely utilizing the high-resolution ground truth as the target for all sampling timesteps. To tackle this problem and achieve higher-quality super-resolution, we propose a novel Frequency Domain-guided multiscale Diffusion model (FDDiff), which decomposes the high-frequency information complementing process into finer-grained steps. In particular, a wavelet packet-based frequency complement chain is developed to provide multiscale intermediate targets with increasing bandwidth for reverse diffusion process. Then FDDiff guides reverse diffusion process to progressively complement the missing high-frequency details over timesteps. Moreover, we design a multiscale frequency refinement network to predict the required high-frequency components at multiple scales within one unified network. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks are conducted, and demonstrate that FDDiff outperforms prior generative methods with higher-fidelity super-resolution results.</description>

      <title>Faces that Speak: Jointly Synthesising Talking Face and Speech from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to simultaneously generate natural talking faces and speech outputs from text. We achieve this by integrating Talking Face Generation (TFG) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems into a unified framework. We address the main challenges of each task: (1) generating a range of head poses representative of real-world scenarios, and (2) ensuring voice consistency despite variations in facial motion for the same identity. To tackle these issues, we introduce a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching, which is capable of high-quality motion code generation in an efficient way. Moreover, we introduce a novel conditioning method for the TTS system, which utilises motion-removed features from the TFG model to yield uniform speech outputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively creates natural-looking talking faces and speech that accurately match the input text. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to build a multimodal synthesis system that can generalise to unseen identities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Post-processing of Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Imaging Using Texture-conserving Deformable Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) is a method capable of providing non-invasive measurements of myocardial microstructure. Image registration is essential to correct image shifts due to intra and inter breath-hold motion and imperfect cardiac triggering. Registration is challenging in DT-CMR due to the low signal-to-noise and various contrasts induced by the diffusion encoding in the myocardium and surrounding organs. Traditional deformable registration corrects through-plane motion but at the risk of destroying the texture information while rigid registration inefficiently discards frames with local deformation. In this study, we explored the possibility of deep learning-based deformable registration on DT-CMR. Based on the noise suppression using low-rank features and diffusion encoding suppression using variational auto encoder-decoder, a B-spline based registration network extracted the displacement fields and maintained the texture features of DT-CMR. In this way, our method improved the efficiency of frame utilization, manual cropping, and computational speed.</description>

      <title>Cell Maps Representation For Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns Classification In Whole Slide Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma is a morphologically heterogeneous disease, characterized by five primary histologic growth patterns. The quantity of these patterns can be related to tumor behavior and has a significant impact on patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline capable of classifying tissue tiles into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUCROC) score of 0.97. Our model's strength lies in its comprehensive consideration of cellular spatial patterns, where it first generates cell maps from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSIs), which are then fed into a convolutional neural network classification model. Exploiting these cell maps provides the model with robust generalizability to new data, achieving approximately 30% higher accuracy on unseen test-sets compared to current state of the art approaches. The insights derived from our model can be used to predict prognosis, enhancing patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Testing the Segment Anything Model on radiology data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained with large amounts of data have become a recent and effective approach to predictive problem solving -- these have become known as "foundation models" as they can be used as fundamental tools for other applications. While the paramount examples of image classification (earlier) and large language models (more recently) led the way, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was recently proposed and stands as the first foundation model for image segmentation, trained on over 10 million images and with recourse to over 1 billion masks. However, the question remains -- what are the limits of this foundation? Given that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stands as an important method of diagnosis, we sought to understand whether SAM could be used for a few tasks of zero-shot segmentation using MRI data. Particularly, we wanted to know if selecting masks from the pool of SAM predictions could lead to good segmentations.
  Here, we provide a critical assessment of the performance of SAM on magnetic resonance imaging data. We show that, while acceptable in a very limited set of cases, the overall trend implies that these models are insufficient for MRI segmentation across the whole volume, but can provide good segmentations in a few, specific slices. More importantly, we note that while foundation models trained on natural images are set to become key aspects of predictive modelling, they may prove ineffective when used on other imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>MMFusion: Multi-modality Diffusion Model for Lymph Node Metastasis Diagnosis in Esophageal Cancer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.</description>
