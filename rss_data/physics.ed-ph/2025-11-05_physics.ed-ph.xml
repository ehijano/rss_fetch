      <title>Code in Motion: Integrating Computational Thinking with Kinematics Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although physics has become increasingly computational, with computing even being considered the third pillar of physics, it is still not well integrated into physics education. Research suggests that integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into physics enhances conceptual understanding and strengthens students' ability to model and analyze phenomena. Building on this, we designed a didactic sequence for K9 students to foster specific CT practices while reinforcing fundamental kinematics concepts. The activity revealed students' ability to apply CT skills and is well suited for use in introductory kinematics courses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Kinematics Understanding through a Video Game Based on Real-Time Motion Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting kinematic graphs remains a significant challenge in physics education. The MissionMotion Project addresses this issue by providing a gamified physical-computational environment combining low-cost sensors, physical activity, computational thinking, and real-time visualization of motion graphs. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of the project, with a particular focus on the pilot phase conducted with high school students in Uruguay. During this phase, we primarily used the MEEGA+ questionnaire to evaluate the gaming experience, usability, and motivation of the participants. Our analysis of the results shows high levels of satisfaction, perceived learning, and engagement, supporting the proposal's viability. Finally, we plan to conduct a large-scale conceptual evaluation to analyze how the proposal impacts understanding of kinematic graphs using standardized assessment tools.</description>
