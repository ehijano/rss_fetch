      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transferable Interatomic Potentials for Glasses toward Experimental Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of molecular simulations is fundamentally limited by the interatomic potentials that govern atomic interactions. Traditional potential development, which relies heavily on ab initio calculations, frequently struggles to reproduce the experimentally observed properties that govern real material behavior. To address this challenge, we present a machine learning-driven, active-learning optimization framework for optimizing classical interatomic potentials to reproduce experimental properties. Our method, here showcased on soda-lime borosilicate glasses, targets both global (density) and local (boron coordination) structural features across a wide range of compositions. By combining a surrogate model with iterative active learning, the framework efficiently explores a five-dimensional parameter space using only 400 molecular dynamics simulations over 17 iterations, making it highly data-efficient and eliminating the need for extensive simulation campaigns. Two transferable parameter sets are identified, each demonstrating good agreement with experimental measurements, including glass density, fraction of four-fold boron, and X-ray structure factor. The framework effectively captures and manages inherent trade-offs between structural objectives and compositional regimes, providing insights into the coordination behavior of boron in complex glass networks. The resulting classical force fields are generalizable and do not require reparameterization for individual compositions. Altogether, this work offers a scalable and experimentally grounded approach for developing transferable interatomic potentials suitable for a broad range of materials, including multi-component glass systems, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transitions Beyond the Nanoscale in Pressurized Silica Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth's interior. While pressure-induced changes in the short-range structure - particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry - have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to $P \approx 100$~GPa. Using a novel many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for $P \lesssim 10$~GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher $P$s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The $P$-dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Prediction of Dark Current Mechanisms in Si:P Blocked Impurity Band (BIB) Infrared Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the nonlinear phenomena observed in the dark current of BIB (blocked-impurity-band) infrared detectors, including negative differential resistance (NDR) and current oscillations. Our analysis systematically elucidated the intrinsic transport mechanisms in optimized devices, revealing that these anomalies arise from current path clustering induced by structural disorder and impurity band conduction dynamics. Notably, the simulated current-voltage (I-V) characteristics demonstrated strong agreement with experimental measurements across a wide bias range, confirming the validity of our proposed physical model.Furthermore, we developed a transformer-based predictive model using experimental dark current datasets. The model achieved robust performance metrics and this framework enables rapid prediction of dark current trends under varying operational conditions, providing actionable insights for detector optimization.</description>

      <title>Time is length in self-similar logarithmic aging of physically cross-linked semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical aging in polymers is a fundamental yet poorly understood phenomenon, as diverse macromolecular systems exhibit remarkably similar slow dynamics. Through molecular dynamics simulations of physically crosslinked networks composed of semiflexible polymers, we identify a previously unexplored class of self-similar aging. The network undergoes ultra-slow coarsening characterized by a logarithmically growing mesh size, $L(t)\sim \ln t$, which governs the spatial organization, cohesive and bending energies, and the aging dynamics of the system. This single time-dependent length scale defines an internal clock, giving rise to spatio- temporal self-similarity of both structure and dynamics - offering a perspective on aging in soft and disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Free Fidelity Estimation via Quantum Output Order Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation-free method to estimate the fidelity of large quantum circuits based on the order statistics of measured output probabilities from highly entangled, chaotic states. The approach requires only the highest-probability output bitstrings -- the most frequently observed measurement outcomes -- and builds on exact analytical results for the order statistics of Haar-random quantum states derived here. Analyzing their modification under depolarizing noise, we propose a scalable fidelity estimator, validated on Google's 12-qubit Sycamore experiment and further supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate its practicality for intermediate-scale quantum circuits, where cross-entropy benchmarking is costly and direct fidelity estimation is difficult.</description>

      <title>GO-Diff: Data-free and amortized global structure optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GO-Diff, a diffusion-based method for global structure optimization that learns to directly sample low-energy atomic configurations without requiring prior data or explicit relaxation. GO-Diff is trained from scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from scratch.</description>

      <title>Networks of neural networks: more is different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural networks with diluted examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</description>

      <title>Defect-driven incoherent skin localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that incorporates the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a soft constraint via a loss function penalty into the ML procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>
