      <title>Exploring the Big Bang with femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the fundamental constituents of the matter around us and in the Universe, as well as their interactions, is among the premier goals of physics. Investigating ultrarelativistic collisions in particle accelerators has delivered answers to these questions many times in the past decades. In this paper we focus on the research aimed at recreating the matter that filled the Universe in the first microsecond after the Big Bang -- but this time in collisions of heavy ions. In particular we discuss the technique called femtoscopy, which provides us a tool to understand the space-time structure of particle creation in heavy-ion collisions. We utilize Levy-stable distributions to investigate this structure and explore its dependence on particle momentum and collision energy.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression from the three-loop QCD potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the suppression of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma using the three-loop QCD static potential. The potential describes the spin-averaged bottomonium spectrum below threshold with a less than 1% error. Within potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and an open quantum systems framework, we compute the evolution of the bottomonium density matrix. The values of the quarkonium transport coefficients are obtained from lattice QCD measurements of the bottomonium in-medium width and thermal mass shift; we additionally include for the first time a vacuum contribution to the dispersive coefficient ${\gamma}$. Using the three-loop potential and the values of the heavy quarkonium transport coefficients, we find that the resulting bottomonium nuclear modification factor is consistent with experimental observations, while at the same time reproducing the lattice measurements of the in-medium width.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Heaven and Earth: Nuclear Astrophysics after GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The historical detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 is providing fundamental new insights into the astrophysical site for the creation of the heaviest elements in the cosmos and on the equation of state of neutron-rich matter. Shortly after this historical detection, electromagnetic observations of neutron stars together with measurements of the properties of neutron-rich nuclei at terrestrial facilities have placed additional constraints on the dynamics of neutron-rich matter. It is this unique synergy between heaven and earth that is the focus of this article.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, encompassing light-flavor, strange-flavor, and light nuclei produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). By conducting a thermal analysis of hadron yields with and without the inclusion of light nuclei yields, we observe a discernible decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ when light nuclei yields are considered. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage of the system evolution. Furthermore, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ associated with strange-flavor particles is found to be approximately $20-30$ MeV higher than that for light-flavor particles and light nuclei, hinting at the existence of multiple freeze-out hyper-surfaces for different hadron types in heavy-ion collisions. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and $\mu_B$ for four distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions. These formulas allow for the selection of appropriate parameters tailored to specific studies, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the freeze-out process.</description>

      <title>Towards $\it{ab}$-$\it{initio}$ nuclear theory calculations of $\delta_\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory framework to study the isospin-symmetry breaking correction $\delta_\text{C}$ in superallowed nuclear beta decays, crucial for the precise determination of $|V_{ud}|$. Based on a general assumptions of the isovector dominance in ISB interactions, we construct a set of functions $F_{T_z}$ which involve nuclear matrix elements of isovector monopole operators and the nuclear Green's function. Via the functions $F_{T_z}$, a connection of $\delta_\text{C}$ to measurable electroweak nuclear radii is established, providing an experimental gauge of the theory accuracy of $\delta_\text{C}$. We outline a strategy to perform ab-initio calculations of $F_{T_z}$ based on the Lanczos algorithm, and discuss its similarity with other nuclear-structure-dependent inputs in nuclear beta decays.</description>

      <title>The dynamic hadronization of charm quarks in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PYTHIA8/ANGANTYR model for heavy ion collisions was recently updated with a mechanism for \textit{global colour reconnection}. The colour reconnection model used is QCD colour algebra inspired and enhances baryon production due to the formation of string junctions. In this paper, we present updates to the junction formation and string fragmentation mechanisms, connected to heavy quark fragmentation. This allows for the simulation of heavy quark fragmentation, using junction formation, in heavy ion collisions. The framework is validated for proton collisions, and we show results for charm baryon production in proton-lead collisions.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb interaction in elastic pion-proton scattering from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential cross sections of the elastic pion-proton scattering are investigated at very small momentum transfer in a holographic QCD model, considering both the strong and Coulomb interaction in the Regge regime. The strong interaction is described by the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, and the Coulomb interaction is characterized by the one photon exchange. The two interactions are linked through an interference term and we only need to determine a single adjustable parameter involved in this term. As to the parameters for the strong interaction, we can utilize the values determined in the previous studies. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the experimental data. We explicitly show the momentum transfer dependence for the interference effect. The energy dependence of the contribution ratios for each component is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>
