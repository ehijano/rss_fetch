      <title>When Thinking Pays Off: Incentive Alignment for Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) has improved human decision-making across various domains by leveraging the complementary capabilities of humans and AI. Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Multimodal Systems for Accessible Remote Dance Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos make exercise instruction widely available, but they rely on visual demonstrations that blind and low vision (BLV) learners cannot see. While audio descriptions (AD) can make videos accessible, describing movements remains challenging as the AD must convey \textit{what} to do (mechanics, location, orientation) and \textit{how} to do it (speed, fluidity, timing). Prior work thus used \textit{multimodal instruction} to support BLV learners with individual simple movements. However, it is unclear how these approaches scale to dance instruction with unique, complex movements and precise timing constraints. To inform accessible remote dance instruction systems, we conducted three co-design workshops (N=28) with BLV dancers, instructors, and experts in sound, haptics, and AD. Participants designed 8 systems revealing common themes: staged learning to dissect routines, crafting vocabularies for movements, and selectively using modalities (narration for movement structure, sound for expression, and haptics for spatial cues). We conclude with design recommendations to make learning dance accessible.</description>

      <title>How AI Responses Shape User Beliefs: The Effects of Information Detail and Confidence on Belief Strength and Stance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs. To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.</description>

      <title>I've Seen Enough: Measuring the Toll of Content Moderation on Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human content moderators (CMs) routinely review distressing digital content at scale. Beyond exposure, the work context (e.g., workload, team structure, and support) may shape mental health outcomes. We examined a cross sectional international CM sample (N = 166) and a U.S. prospective CM sample, including a comparison group of data labelers or tech support workers (N = 45) and gold standard diagnostic interviews. Predictors included workplace factors (e.g., hours per day distressing content, culture), cognitive-affective individual differences, and coping. Across samples, probable diagnoses based on validated clinical cutoffs were elevated (PTSD: 25.9 to 26.3%; depression: 42.1 to 48.5%; somatic symptoms: 68.7 to 89.5%; alcohol misuse: 10.5% to 18.3%). In the U.S. sample, CMs had higher interviewer rated PTSD severity (d = 1.50), likelihood of a current mood disorder (RR = 8.22), and lifetime major depressive disorder (RR = 2.15) compared to data labelers/tech-support workers. Negative automatic thoughts (b = .39 to .74), ongoing stress (b = .27 to .55), and avoidant coping (b = .30 to .34) consistently predicted higher PTSD and depression severity across samples and at 3 month followup. Poorer perceived workplace culture was associated with higher depression (b = -.16 to -.32). These findings strongly implicate organizational context and related individual response styles, not exposure dose alone in shaping risk. We highlight structural and technological interventions such as limits on daily exposure, supportive team culture, interface features to reduce intrusive memories, and training of cognitive restructuring and adaptive coping to support mental health. We also connect implications to adjacent human in the loop data work (e.g., AI red teaming), where similar risks are emerging.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Lightweight Gaze Privacy-Preservation Techniques Validated via Offline Gaze-Based Interaction Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of the real-time privacy-preserving techniques through an offline gaze-based interaction simulation framework. Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and Qualitative Comparison of Generative Models for Subject-Specific Gaze Synthesis: Diffusion vs GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the ability to generate synthetic gaze data. However, most approaches have primarily focused on generating data from random noise distributions or global, predefined latent embeddings, whereas individualized gaze sequence generation has been less explored. To address this gap, we revisit two recent approaches based on diffusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) and introduce modifications that make both models explicitly subject-aware while improving accuracy and effectiveness. For the diffusion-based approach, we utilize compact user embeddings that emphasize per-subject traits. Moreover, for the GAN-based approach, we propose a subject-specific synthesis module that conditioned the generator to retain better idiosyncratic gaze information. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of these modified approaches utilizing standard eye-tracking signal quality metrics, including spatial accuracy and precision. This work helps define synthetic signal quality, realism, and subject specificity, thereby contributing to the potential development of gaze-based applications.</description>

      <title>Grating haptic perception through touchscreen: Sighted vs. Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\% vs. 84.5\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.</description>

      <title>Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for "legitimate" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting "response instability"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing "model instability"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Ethics of Internet Measurement: Researchers' Perspectives from a Case Study in the EU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.</description>

      <title>Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.</description>

      <title>Preview, Accept or Discard? A Predictive Low-Motion Interaction Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.</description>

      <title>Bytes of a Feather: Personality and Opinion Alignment Effects in Human-AI Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions with AI assistants are increasingly personalized to individual users. As AI personalization is dynamic and machine-learning-driven, we have limited understanding of how personalization affects interaction outcomes and user perceptions. We conducted a large-scale controlled experiment in which 1,000 participants interacted with AI assistants that took on certain personality traits and opinion stances. Our results show that participants consistently preferred to interact with models that shared their opinions. Participants also found opinion-aligned models more trustworthy, competent, warm, and persuasive, corroborating an AI-similarity-attraction hypothesis. In contrast, we observed no or only weak effects of AI personality alignment, with introvert models rated as less trustworthy and competent by introvert participants. These findings highlight opinion alignment as a central dimension of AI personalization and user preference, while underscoring the need for a more grounded discussion of the limits and risks of personalized AI.</description>

      <title>Alignment Debt: The Hidden Work of Making AI Usable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier LLMs are optimised around high-resource assumptions about language, knowledge, devices, and connectivity. Whilst widely accessible, they often misfit conditions in the Global South. As a result, users must often perform additional work to make these systems usable. We term this alignment debt: the user-side burden that arises when AI systems fail to align with cultural, linguistic, infrastructural, or epistemic contexts. We develop and validate a four-part taxonomy of alignment debt through a survey of 411 AI users in Kenya and Nigeria. Among respondents measurable on this taxonomy (n = 385), prevalence is: Cultural and Linguistic (51.9%), Infrastructural (43.1%), Epistemic (33.8%), and Interaction (14.0%). Country comparisons show a divergence in Infrastructural and Interaction debt, challenging one-size-fits-Africa assumptions. Alignment debt is associated with compensatory labour, but responses vary by debt type: users facing Epistemic challenges verify outputs at significantly higher rates (91.5% vs. 80.8%; p = 0.037), and verification intensity correlates with cumulative debt burden (Spearmans rho = 0.147, p = 0.004). In contrast, Infrastructural and Interaction debts show weak or null associations with verification, indicating that some forms of misalignment cannot be resolved through verification alone. These findings show that fairness must be judged not only by model metrics but also by the burden imposed on users at the margins, compelling context-aware safeguards that alleviate alignment debt in Global South settings. The alignment debt framework provides an empirically grounded way to measure user burden, informing both design practice and emerging African AI governance efforts.</description>

      <title>Why Open Small AI Models Matter for Interactive Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.</description>

      <title>Owlgorithm: Supporting Self-Regulated Learning in Competitive Programming through LLM-Driven Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Autonomous X-ray Fluorescence Mapping of Chemically Heterogeneous Systems via a Correlative Feature Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions. Future extensions will incorporate machine learning and probabilistic sampling to further improve detection sensitivity and scan efficiency. X-AutoMap is currently in active use at HXN and provides a flexible foundation for scalable, intelligent imaging workflows at synchrotron beamlines.</description>

      <title>FineSkiing: A Fine-grained Benchmark for Skiing Action Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Emotionally Intelligent and Responsible Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Device Type, Data Practices, and Use Case Scenarios on Privacy Concerns about Eye-tracked Augmented Reality in the United States and Germany</title>

Abstract: Augmented reality technology will likely be prevalent with more affordable head-mounted displays. Integrating novel interaction modalities, such as eye trackers into head-mounted displays could lead to collecting vast amounts of biometric data, which may allow inference of sensitive user attributes like health status or sexual preference, posing privacy issues. While previous works broadly examined privacy concerns about augmented reality, ours is the first to extensively explore privacy concerns on behavioral data, particularly eye tracking in augmented reality. We crowdsourced four survey studies in the United States (n1 = 48, n2 = 525) and Germany (n3 = 48, n4 = 525) to understand the impact of user attributes, augmented reality devices, use cases, data practices, and country on privacy concerns. Our findings indicate that participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data. Furthermore, participants in the United States are less concerned about their privacy than those in Germany. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to practitioners and policymakers for privacy-aware augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Teaching LLMs to See and Guide: Context-Aware Real-Time Assistance in Augmented Reality</title>

Abstract: The growing adoption of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) technologies in industrial training and on-the-job assistance has created new opportunities for intelligent, context-aware support systems. As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</description>

      <title>Bridging LMS and generative AI: dynamic course content integration (DCCI) for enhancing student satisfaction and engagement via the ask ME assistant</title>

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can enhance task automation and accessibility in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or misleading information remains a challenge. This study introduces the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically retrieves course content from Canvas LMS and structures it within an LLM's context window via prompt engineering, enabling the LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME, to deliver context-aware, curriculum-aligned responses while mitigating hallucinations. A mixed-methods pilot study grounded in Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence) and the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness, ease of use) evaluated DCCI's effectiveness with 120 first-year programming students at E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University. The course focused on foundational programming patterns in C#, including writing program specifications. We analyzed 14,746 logged interactions and a post-course survey completed by 101 students. User satisfaction was measured via a 5-point Likert scale (turn-level ratings), while the survey assessed usability, engagement, and ethical concerns. Results indicated high satisfaction (mean 4.65/5) and strong recognition of Ask ME's ability to provide timely, contextually relevant answers to administrative and course-related queries. 78.06% agreed that Ask ME's Canvas integration reduced platform switching, improving usability, engagement, comprehension, and topic exploration. Many students reported reduced hesitation to ask questions and increased motivation for self-directed learning, though concerns about over-reliance on AI and reduced student-teacher interaction emerged. This study demonstrates that DCCI enhances LLM reliability, student satisfaction, and engagement in AI-driven educational automation, while highlighting the importance of balancing</description>

      <title>Understanding Human-AI Trust in Education</title>

Abstract: As AI chatbots become integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity over whether students develop trust in them in ways similar to trusting a human peer or instructor (human-like trust, often linked to interpersonal trust models) or in ways similar to trusting a conventional technology (system-like trust, often linked to technology trust models). This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social systems, leaving their applicability to conversational, human-like agents unclear. To address this gap, we examine how these two forms of trust, human-like and system-like, comparatively influence students' perceptions of an AI chatbot, specifically perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that both forms of trust significantly influenced student perceptions, though with varied effects. Human-like trust was the stronger predictor of trusting intention, whereas system-like trust more strongly influenced behavioral intention and perceived usefulness; both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. The results suggest that interactions with AI chatbots give rise to a distinct form of trust, human-AI trust, that differs from human-human and human-technology models, highlighting the need for new theoretical frameworks in this domain. In addition, the study offers practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.</description>

      <title>Text to Robotic Assembly of Multi Component Objects using 3D Generative AI and Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</description>
