      <title>Advanced Statistical Arbitrage with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical arbitrage is a prevalent trading strategy which takes advantage of mean reverse property of spread of paired stocks. Studies on this strategy often rely heavily on model assumption. In this study, we introduce an innovative model-free and reinforcement learning based framework for statistical arbitrage. For the construction of mean reversion spreads, we establish an empirical reversion time metric and optimize asset coefficients by minimizing this empirical mean reversion time. In the trading phase, we employ a reinforcement learning framework to identify the optimal mean reversion strategy. Diverging from traditional mean reversion strategies that primarily focus on price deviations from a long-term mean, our methodology creatively constructs the state space to encapsulate the recent trends in price movements. Additionally, the reward function is carefully tailored to reflect the unique characteristics of mean reversion trading.</description>

      <title>Student t-L\'evy regression model in YUIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss an estimation and a simulation method in the \textsf{R} package YUIMA for a linear regression model driven by a Student-$t$ L\'evy process with constant scale and arbitrary degrees of freedom. This process finds applications in several fields, for example finance, physic, biology, etc. The model presents two main issues. The first is related to the simulation of a sample path at high-frequency level. Indeed, only the $t$-L\'evy increments defined on an unitary time interval are Student-$t$ distributed. In YUIMA, we solve this problem by means of the inverse Fourier transform for simulating the increments of a Student-$t$ L\'{e}vy defined on a interval with any length. A second problem is due to the fact that joint estimation of trend, scale, and degrees of freedom does not seem to have been investigated as yet. In YUIMA, we develop a two-step estimation procedure that efficiently deals with this issue. Numerical examples are given in order to explain methods and classes used in the YUIMA package.</description>

      <title>FinLlama: Financial Sentiment Classification for Algorithmic Trading Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are multiple sources of financial news online which influence market movements and trader's decisions. This highlights the need for accurate sentiment analysis, in addition to having appropriate algorithmic trading techniques, to arrive at better informed trading decisions. Standard lexicon based sentiment approaches have demonstrated their power in aiding financial decisions. However, they are known to suffer from issues related to context sensitivity and word ordering. Large Language Models (LLMs) can also be used in this context, but they are not finance-specific and tend to require significant computational resources. To facilitate a finance specific LLM framework, we introduce a novel approach based on the Llama 2 7B foundational model, in order to benefit from its generative nature and comprehensive language manipulation. This is achieved by fine-tuning the Llama2 7B model on a small portion of supervised financial sentiment analysis data, so as to jointly handle the complexities of financial lexicon and context, and further equipping it with a neural network based decision mechanism. Such a generator-classifier scheme, referred to as FinLlama, is trained not only to classify the sentiment valence but also quantify its strength, thus offering traders a nuanced insight into financial news articles. Complementing this, the implementation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning through LoRA optimises trainable parameters, thus minimising computational and memory requirements, without sacrificing accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed FinLlama to provide a framework for enhanced portfolio management decisions and increased market returns. These results underpin the ability of FinLlama to construct high-return portfolios which exhibit enhanced resilience, even during volatile periods and unpredictable market events.</description>
