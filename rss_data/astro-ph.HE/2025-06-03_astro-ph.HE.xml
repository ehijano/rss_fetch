      <title>Complete survey of r-process conditions: the (un-)robustness of the r-process(-es)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy elements are synthesized by the r-process in neutron star mergers and potentially in rare supernovae linked to strong magnetic fields. Expensive hydrodynamic simulations of these extreme environments are usually post-processed to calculate the nucleosynthesis. In contrast, here we follow a site-independent approach based on three key parameters: electron fraction, entropy, and expansion timescale. Our model reproduces the results based on hydrodynamic simulations. Moreover, the 120 000 astrophysical conditions analyzed allow us to systematically and generally explore the astrophysical conditions of the r-process, also beyond those found in current simulations. Our results show that a wide range of conditions produce very similar abundance patterns explaining the observed robustness of the r-process between the second and third peak. Furthermore, we cannot find a single condition that produces the full r-process from first to third peak. Instead, a superposition of at least two or three conditions or components is required to reproduce the typical r-process pattern as observed in the solar system and very old stars. The different final abundances are grouped into eight nucleosynthesis clusters, which can be used to select representative conditions for comparisons to observations and investigations of the nuclear physics input.</description>

      <title>Radiation-magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Accretion Flow Formation After a Tidal Disruption Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the fallback debris after a tidal disruption event. We focus on studying the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and early evolution of the accretion flow. We find that large magnetic fields can increase the debris stream thickness, moderately reducing the efficiency of the radiative acceleration of outflows during the first self-intersecting collisions. As gas accumulates and the collisions happen instead between the infalling stream and the accretion flow, magnetized and nonmagnetized systems evolve similarly at these early times: radiation-driven outflows dominate early after the initial stream-stream collision and a few days later, the accretion rate exceeds the mass outflow rate. We find that the MRI does not play a significant role in angular momentum transport and dissipation. Nor do we find evidence of a magnetocentrifugal driven outflow. Instead, collisions continue to dissipate kinetic energy into radiation that launches outflows and powers TDE luminosities reaching $L\sim4-6\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Shock-driven outflows and inflows redistribute angular momentum throughout the extent ($\sim50 r_s$) of the forming eccentric disk. Even in the presence of magnetic stresses, the accretion flow remains mostly eccentric with $e\sim0.2-0.3$ for $r\lesssim8r_s$ and $e\sim0.4-0.5$ for $10\lesssim r\,(r_s)\lesssim50$. Lastly, we find a polar angle-dependent density structure compatible with the viewing-angle effect, along with an additional azimuthal angle dependence established by the collisions.</description>

      <title>SPLASH: A Rapid Host-Based Supernova Classifier for Wide-Field Time-Domain Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology and Universal Relations in Neutron Stars with Gravitationally Bound Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, dynamical, and oscillatory properties of neutron stars admixed with dark matter, modeled via a single-fluid formalism where dark matter interacts with nuclear matter through an effective Higgs-portal coupling. Employing three relativistic mean-field nuclear matter equations of state-IOPB-I, BigApple, and NL3- we incorporate a physically motivated dark matter number density profile that scales with baryon density and is controlled by two parameters: a scaling factor $\alpha M_\chi$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and a steepness index $\beta$. We construct equilibrium configurations and analyze their stability via radial oscillations, finding that dark matter-induced gravitational compression lowers the maximum mass and alters the radial mode spectrum in a nontrivial, $\beta$-dependent fashion. We also compute the frequencies of non-radial fluid oscillations under the relativistic Cowling approximation and analyze the persistence of universal relations in the presence of dark matter. While deviations appear under extreme configurations, the overall structure of these relations remains robust. Our findings offer a consistent framework to probe dark matter effects on neutron star dynamics across a range of realistic models.</description>

      <title>Spectral Hardening Reveals Afterglow Emergence in Long-Duration Fast X-ray Transients: A Case Study of GRB 250404A/EP250404a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt emission and afterglow phases of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been extensively studied, yet the transition between these two phases remains inadequately characterized due to limited multiwavelength observational coverage. Among the recent growing samples of fast X-ray transients observed by Einstein Probe (EP), a subgroup of gamma-ray bursts are captured with long-duration X-ray emission, potentially containing featured evolution from prompt emission to the afterglow phase. In this Letter, we present a detailed analysis of GRB 250404A/EP250404a, a bright fast X-ray transient detected simultaneously by EP and Fermi/GBM in X-rays and gamma-rays. Its continuous X-ray emission reveals a long-duration tail, accompanied by distinct spectral evolution manifested by the spectral index $\alpha_{\rm X}$ with an initial softening, followed by an evident hardening, eventually reaching a plateau at the value of $\sim$ -2. Early optical and near-infrared observations enable broadband modeling with forward- and reverse-shock components, confirming that the X-ray hardening signals the emergence of the external-shock afterglow. From this spectral hardening we infer that the prompt phase in soft X-rays lasted $\sim300$ s, which is more than three times longer than the gamma-ray $T_{90}$. This well-tracked soft-hard-flat spectral pattern provides a clear indication of afterglow emergence from the fading prompt emission and offers a practical criterion for identifying a distinct population of GRBs among fast X-ray transients, even when the detection of the gamma-ray counterpart or obvious temporal break is absent.</description>

      <title>Giant Atmospheric Showers Detected by the Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two most powerful extensive air showers (EAS) with energies of about $10^{20}$ eV, registered at the Yakutsk EAS array during the entire observation period of 1974-2024, are considered. Both showers hit the array near the center and triggered all surface detectors and underground muon detectors with a threshold energy of $E_{\mu} = 1.0 \times \cos \theta$ GeV. These events have an abnormally high fraction of muons, which is beyond current model predictions. This may change our understanding of hadron interactions at ultra-high energy, but there is also a possibility that these showers were initiated by some exotic primary particles.</description>

      <title>Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1-0.2. Furthermore, the spins in the first-born black holes appear lower than in the second-born ones. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high, $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$. This is the case, in particular, for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0, while their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion, but only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, we find the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into the incident and reflected ones, which is intrinsically highly uncertain. The method of spectral fitting accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models give the disk temperatures higher than the standard models, and consequently predict lower spins. We postulate that the published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. We hypothesize that the spins of the binaries with high-mass donors are low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high, including high spins as required to power relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of Energy Constraints for Positrons Generating the Galactic Annihilation Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even 50 years after the discovery of a positron annihilation line from the inner Galaxy, no class of astrophysical sources has emerged as a definitive explanation for both the emission morphology and flux. Positrons produced by dark matter annihilation or decay have been proposed, but the mass of any such candidate is constrained by continuum $\gamma$-ray emission at energies $&gt;511$ keV. Earlier analyses have claimed that this emission requires that the positrons have kinetic energies less than a few MeV at injection, disfavoring both much of the dark matter parameter space and many potential compact astrophysical source classes such as pulsars. However, these constraints were not based on a full forward model of the $\gamma$-ray line and continuum data, and did not marginalize over uncertainties about the relative angular distributions of the line and continuum. Here we describe an improved analysis that overcomes these limitations, and show that constraints on the injection energy are much weaker than previously claimed; even under conservative assumptions the data are consistent with initial energies up to $\sim 50$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Evidence of oscillating `compact' Comptonized corona in GRS 1915+105: Insights into HFQPOs with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, for the first time, an in-depth dynamical analysis of the spectro-temporal properties of the soft variability classes ($\delta$, $\kappa$, $\omega$, and $\gamma$) of GRS 1915+105 during the detection of $\sim$70 Hz High-Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) using AstroSat data. The wide-band spectra ($0.7-50$ keV) are well described by thermal Comptonization along with an extended power-law component. Additionally, power spectra ($0.01-500$ Hz) indicate that Comptonized photons ($6-25$ keV) primarily contribute to the HFQPOs. Our findings reveal that high (low) count rates referred to as `non-dips' (`dips') in the light curves of the variability classes correspond to the detection (non-detection) of HFQPOs. Accumulated `non-dips' (`dips') spectra are modelled separately using thermal Comptonization (\texttt{nthComp}) as well as \texttt{kerrd} which indicates harder spectra and smaller inner disc radius during the detection of HFQPOs. We conduct dynamical analyses (every 32 s) to trace the presence of HFQPOs, and variations in thermal Comptonization parameters ($\Gamma_{\rm nth}$ and ${\rm N}_{\rm nth}$). Moreover, we observe a positive correlation of `non-dips' with QPO strength, ${\rm HR}1$, and ${\rm N}_{\rm nth}$, while $\Gamma_{\rm nth}$ shows an anti-correlation, suggesting that high-energy photons from the Comptonized corona are responsible for the HFQPOs. Furthermore, we estimate the size of the Comptonized corona using \texttt{kerrd} and \texttt{diskpn} to be $\sim 2.8 - 16$ $r_{\rm g}$. Thus, we infer that a `compact' oscillating corona likely modulates the high-energy radiation, exhibiting the $70$ Hz HFQPOs in GRS 1915$+$105.</description>

      <title>X-ray reflection spectroscopy with improved calculations of the emission angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflection spectrum produced by a cold medium illuminated by X-ray photons is not isotropic and its shape depends on the emission angle. In the reflection spectrum of an accretion disk of a black hole, the value of the emission angle changes over the disk and, in general, is different from the value of the inclination angle of the disk because of the light bending in the strong gravitational field of the black hole. Current reflection models make some approximations, as calculating a reflection spectrum taking the correct emission angle at every point of the disk into account would be too time-consuming and make the model too slow to analyze observations. In a recent paper, we showed that these approximations are unsuitable to fit high-quality black hole spectra expected from the next generation of X-ray missions. Here, we present a reflection model with improved calculations of the emission angle that solves this problem.</description>

      <title>Correlations between Event Rates of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts and Star Formation Rates with/without Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the redshift and luminosity distributions as well as the event rates of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by Swift, Fermi, Konus-wind satellites. It is found that the distributions of redshift and luminosity of Fermi and Konus-wind SGRBs are identical and they obviously differ from those of Swift/BAT SGRBs. The luminosity distributions of SGRBs detected by diverse detectors can be uniformly fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The median luminosity of Swift SGRBs is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of Fermi/GBM or Konus-wind SGRBs. We also compare the local event rates of Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM and Konus-wind SGRBs and find that the local rate of Swift SGRBs is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of either Fermi or Konus-wind SGRBs, while the latter two rates are comparable. The observed SGRB rates can be successfully fitted by a power-law plus Gauss function. The SGRB rates of three kinds of detectors matches the delayed/undelayed SFRs well except the delayed Lognormal and/or Gaussian SFRs at higher redshift and exceed all types of SFRs at lower redshift of $z&lt;1$. After deducting the diverse SFR components from the SGRB rates, we surprisingly notice that the remaining SGRB rates steeply decline with redshift in a power-law-like form, indicating that these SGRBs could emerge from the old star populations or compact binary star mergers.</description>

      <title>Unique microquasar SS433: new results, new issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique microquasar SS433 is a massive X-ray binary system at an advanced evolutionary stage. The optical star overflows its Roche lobe and transfers mass at a very high rate onto a black hole surrounded by a supercritical accretion disk with relativistic jets inclined to the orbital plane. Both disk and jets precess with a period of 162.3 days. In the outer parts of the precessing jets, emission lines of hydrogen and neutral helium are formed, moving periodically across the spectrum of SS433 with an enormous amplitude of $\sim 1000$\,\AA\ or, on the $\sim 50000$ km/s velocity scale. A 30-year spectral and photometric monitoring of SS433 has been carried out at Sternberg Astronomical Institute. Using all published data for 45 years of observations, we obtained a number of important results concerning the nature of this unique microquasar. We discovered a secular evolutionary increase in the orbital period of SS433 at a rate of $(1.14 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}$ seconds per second, suggesting that the relativistic object in SS433 is a black hole with mass exceeding 8\,${\rm M}_\odot$. It is shown that the distance between the components of SS433 increases with time, which prevents the formation of a common envelope in the system. The size of the Roche lobe of the optical donor star is on average constant in time, which ensures a stable secondary mass exchange in the system. The orbital ellipticity of SS433 was discovered, strongly supporting the model of a slaved accretion disk tracking the precession of the rotation axis of the optical star, which is inclined to the orbital plane due to an asymmetric supernova explosion. Parameters of the kinematic model of SS433, except for the precession period, keep on average constant for 45 years.

      <title>The Cygnus X-1 Puzzle: Implications of X-ray Polarization Measurements in the Soft and Hard States on the Properties of the Accretion Flow and the Emission Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the implications of the recent X-ray polarization observations of the X-ray Black Hole Binary (XRBHB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) with IXPE and XL-Calibur. The discussion highlights the importance of the distance range from which the radiating zone draws its energy, and of the mechanism that transports the energy from the accretion disk into the radiating zone. We examine compact and extended corona models, finding that the former are energetically favored, but the latter cannot yet be fully excluded. Finally, the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and in the hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet, is addressed. A scenario for the soft state is proposed in which shear stresses and magnetic reconnection create a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk, with the pairs accelerating due to radiation pressure from the accretion disk to mildly relativistic velocities. Comptonization by these pairs at roughly the same temperature as the accretion disk's radiation can explain the polarization properties without major modifications of the emitted energy spectrum. We emphasize that the geometry of the accretion flow in the hard state is still not well constrained, and that the polarization results depend sensitively on plasma processes responsible for energy dissipation in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Testing the Young FRB Progenitor Hypothesis: A Crossmatch of Catalog-1 CHIME Bursts with Historic Local Universe Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most energetic and enigmatic transients in the radio sky, with mounting evidence suggesting newborn, highly magnetized neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as their sources. A definitive spatial association between an FRB and a historic CCSN would confirm this link and tightly constrain young neutron star source models. Here we report on the first systematic cross-matching of 886 spectroscopically classified CCSNe in the local Universe (z $\leq$ 0.043) against 241 CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 events, applying rigorous spatial, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering time (${\tau}$) criteria. We identify four positional overlaps, all consistent with chance alignment; however, one pair, FRB 20190412B-SN 2009gi, also satisfies independent host-DM and ${\tau}$ constraints, making it a promising candidate for targeted follow-up. Next, we search for compact (persistent or transient) radio emission at all matched supernova sites using multi-epoch VLASS data and detect none. Treating every CCSN sight line as a non-detection, we derive Poisson upper limits on the FRB burst rate at these locations, which lie well below the rates observed for the most active repeaters unless their activity is heavily suppressed by beaming, intermittency, or residual free-free absorption. We then develop a galaxy-integrated FRB-rate model that incorporates an intrinsic spectral index, secular magnetar-activity decay, and frequency-dependent free-free opacity. Applying this formalism to existing FRB data shows that reproducing the observed CHIME/CRAFT all-sky rate ratio requires a steep decline in magnetar burst rates with age. Finally, our work underscores the necessity of sub-arcsecond localizations and multiwavelength follow-up to definitively test the young neutron star source hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of relativistic shock breakout from a stellar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of relativistic radiation-mediated shocks (RRMS) in the photon-starved regime, incorporating photon escape from the upstream region -- characterized by the escape fraction, $f_{esc}$ -- under a steady-state assumption. These simulations, performed for shock Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u = 2$, $6$, and $10$, are applicable to RRMS breakouts occurring in shallowly declining density profiles, such as stellar winds. We find that vigorous pair production acts as a thermostat, regulating the downstream temperature to $\sim 100$-$200~{\rm keV}$, largely independent of $f_{\rm esc}$. A subshock forms and strengthens with increasing $f_{esc}$. The escaping spectra consistently peak at $E_p \approx 300$-$600~{\rm keV}$ in the shock frame and deviate from a Wien distribution, exhibiting low-energy flattening ($f_\nu \propto \nu^0$) due to free-free emission and high-energy extensions caused by inverse Compton scattering from subshock-heated pairs. While the existing analytical model (Granot et al. 2018) reproduces the velocity structure well at $\Gamma_u = 2$, it significantly overestimates the shock width at higher Lorentz factors, particularly for $f_{esc} \gtrsim$ a few $\%$. Based on this finding, we provide updated predictions for breakout observables in wind environments for $\Gamma_u \gtrsim 6$. Notably, the duration of the relativistic breakout becomes largely insensitive to the explosion energy and ejecta mass, typically exceeding analytical predictions by orders of magnitude and capable of producing a $\sim$200 s flash of MeV photons with a radiated energy of $\sim 7 \times 10^{49}$ erg for an energetic explosion yielding $\Gamma_{bo} \sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Low-velocity precessing jets can explain observed morphologies in the Twin Radio Galaxy TRG J104454+354055</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of large-scale radio jets in merger systems has been drastically improved in the era of VLA, VLBA/EVN, uGMRT, and MeerKAT. Twin Radio Galaxies (TRGs) are the rare interacting galaxy pairs where both supermassive black holes host kiloparsec-scale bipolar radio jets. Only recently was a third TRG discovered and it shows significantly different jet morphologies than the previous two. Due to both the extreme paucity and complexity of such systems, the launching of their jets as well as their mutual interaction during the propagation through the ambient medium are not well understood. We have performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the bipolar jets in the third TRG, J104454+354055. Our study indicates that the precession of mutually tilted bipolar jets originating from the two galactic nuclei separated by tens of kiloparsecs and propagating at low velocities can explain the observed morphologies. The simulated jet precession timescales are short compared to the overall dynamical timescale of the jets and could originate from Lense-Thirring effects in the accretion disks. This approach to understanding the TRG jet dynamics could also be applied to other TRG systems with similar helical morphologies that may be discovered in the upcoming era of the SKA and its pathfinder surveys.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of the binary black hole mass spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a summary of an invited talk given at the Moriond Gravitation meeting on March 31, 2025. I touch on some of the practical challenges of measuring the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes through their gravitational-wave signatures. I then describe my take on the current state of interpreting the observed binary black hole mass spectrum from the perspective of models for the formation of these sources. I conclude that meaningful progress must rely on the combination of gravitational-wave observations and a broad range of electromagnetic observations of massive stellar binaries at earlier stages of their evolution. This is my very personal and necessarily brief take on the current state of the field and does not aspire to the balance or completeness of a review.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</description>

      <title>First eccentric inspiral-merger-ringdown analysis of neutron star-black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW200105 was the first confident neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. A recent analysis by Morras et al. with an eccentric precessing waveform model that describes the inspiral phase of the $l=2$ and $m=\{0,\pm 2\}$ modes has identified this event as the first NSBH merger with strong evidence of orbital eccentricity. In this paper we perform the first analysis of this event with an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model that describes the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown, includes subdominant harmonics, and is partially calibrated to numerical relativity simulations. This analysis confirms the results and finds evidence in favor of eccentricity even with a log-uniform prior in eccentricity. We also analyze the NSBH events GW200115 and GW230529, completing the analysis of all NSBHs with IMRPhenomTEHM, and find that these signal are consistent with vanishing eccentricity. Finally, we briefly discuss computational challenges when performing the analysis with time-domain eccentric waveform models.</description>

      <title>Science Prospects for the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory: SWGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach.
  SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.</description>

      <title>Shape and ionization of equatorial matter near compact objects from X-ray polarization reflection signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming around the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to releasing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.</description>

      <title>Role of thermal fluctuations in nucleation of three-flavor quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework that aims to investigate the role of thermal fluctuations of the matter composition and color-superconductivity in the nucleation of three-flavor deconfined quark matter in the typical conditions of high-energy astrophysical systems related to compact stars. It is usually assumed that the flavor composition is locally fixed during the formation of the first seed of deconfined quark matter since weak interaction acts too slowly to re-equilibrate flavors. However, the matter composition fluctuates around its average equilibrium values at the typical temperatures of high-energy astrophysical processes. Here, we extend our previous two-flavor nucleation formalism to a three-flavor case. We develop a thermodynamic framework incorporating finite-size effects and thermal fluctuations of local composition to compute the nucleation probability as the product of droplet formation and composition fluctuation rates. Moreover, we discuss the role of color-superconductivity in nucleation, arguing that it can play a role only in systems larger than the typical coherence length of diquark pairs. We found that thermal fluctuations of the matter composition lead to lowering the potential barrier between the metastable hadronic phase and the stable quark phase. Moreover, the formation of diquark pairs reduces the critical radius and thus the potential barrier in the low baryon density and temperature regime.</description>

Abstract: We present HYDE, a new one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, and use it to construct a grid of supernova (SN) models based on solar-metallicity bare helium-core models evolved to the verge of core-collapse with MESA STAR. This grid is suited to model Type IIb SNe, which progenitor stars are thought to have lost all but a tiny fraction of their hydrogen envelopes. Using an automated procedure we fit the bolometric lightcurves and photospheric velocities for a large sample of (17) Type IIb SNe to the grid of SN models. We find that the distribution of initial masses for the sample can be reasonably well described by a standard Salpeter IMF, although there is an under-population in the &gt;25 M$_\odot$ range. The fractions of SNe with initial masses &lt;15 M$_\odot$ and &lt;20 M$_\odot$ are 56 and 81 percent, respectively, suggesting either the binary channel to dominate the production of Type IIb SNe or a flaw in our understanding of single-star mass-loss. We find correlations between the explosion energy, initial mass and mass of $^{56}$Ni; the explosion energy increases with initial mass and the mass of $^{56}$Ni increases with explosion energy. The method used allows us to determine the errors in the model parameters arising from the observed quantities and the degeneracy of the solution. We find that an error in the distance and extinction propagates mainly to the derived mass of $^{56}$Ni, whereas an error in the photospheric velocity propagates mainly to the derived helium-core mass and explosion energy. Fits using the bolometric lightcurve alone are completely degenerate along the M$_{\mathrm{ej}}^{2}$/E$_{\mathrm{ej}}$=const curve, whereas fits using also the photospheric velocities are quite robust for well-sampled SNe. Finally, we provide a description and tests of the HYDE code, and a discussion of the limitations of the method used.</description>

      <title>Identifying hyperons in neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass radius curve $dM/dR$ determined from two large sets of relativistic mean field equations of state for nucleonic and hyperonic neutron star matter is discussed. It is shown that if the mass-radius curve always has a negative slope the probability that the star has hyperons is very small. A very small probability of the presence of hyperons can already be identified by a negative slope for low-mass stars. A positive slope at $M/M_{\odot} = 1.4$, could indicate the possible presence of hyperons. Nucleonic EoS are found to be more probable than hyperonic ones, given the GW170817 and NICER observation constraints for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the highest probability is associated with nucleonic stars that originate a mass radius curve with positive slope. Mass-radius curves with a positive slope greater than 1.8$M_\odot$ are not expected to occur. The nuclear matter property that most distinguishes the different scenarios is the curvature of the symmetry energy, with nucleonic EoS with positive slope predicting the highest values that can go above 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis Study on the Binary Origin of Type Ibn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a class of SN explosions whose progenitors are surrounded by dense helium-rich circumstellar matter (CSM). Some models have been proposed for how to form the dense CSM, with promising scenarios involving either binaries with a low-mass ($\lesssim 3~M_\odot$) helium (He) star, or mergers following common envelope phases between a He star and a compact object. Using rapid binary population synthesis calculations, we estimate the event rate of these channels and compare it with the observed SN Ibn rate. We find that exploding low-mass He stars in close binaries (of separations $\lesssim$ a few 100 $R_\odot$) can be sufficiently produced to account for the observed event rate of SN Ibn, while the merger scenario can likely account for only a fraction of these SNe. We discuss the types of companions expected in the low-mass He star scenario, finding massive main sequence stars ($10$--$20\ M_\odot$) to be typical, with a potentially non-negligible fraction ($&lt;10\%$) of binaries with WD companions that have long delay times of up to $100$ Myrs.</description>

      <title>A general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation code for studying advective, sub-Keplerian accretion flow onto black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation code which is developed to simulate advective accretion flow onto black holes. We are particularly interested in the accretion simulations of sub-Keplerian matter in the close vicinity of black holes. Due to the presence of centrifugal barrier, a nearly free-falling sub-Keplerian accretion flow slows down close to a black hole and can even pass through shocks before accelerating again to the black hole. We design our simulation code using the high resolution shock capturing scheme so that such shock structures can be captured and analyzed for relevance. In this paper, we describe our implementation and validation of the code against a few known analytical and numerical results of sub-Keplerian matter accretion.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Crab Nebula with the Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope stereoscopic system at low altitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20\% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10\% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.</description>

      <title>Cautionary tales on heating-rate prescriptions in kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major ingredient for kilonova lightcurves is the radioactive heating rate and its dependence on the electron fraction and velocity of the ejecta and, in principle, on the nuclear mass formula. Heating-rate formulae commonly used as the basis for kilonova models previously employed in the literature produce substantially different outputs for high electron fractions ($Y_{e} \gtrsim 0.3$) and at late times ($t \gtrsim 1$d) compared to newer prescriptions. Here, we employ standard semi-analytical models for kilonovae with better heating rate prescriptions valid for the full parameter space of kilonova velocities and electron fractions to explore the impact of the heating rate on kilonova lightcurves. We show the dangers of using inappropriate heating rate estimates by simulating realistic observations and inferring the kilonova parameters via a misspecified heating-rate prescription. While providing great fits to the photometry, an incorrect heating-rate prescription fails to recover the input ejecta masses with a bias significantly larger than the typical statistical uncertainty. This bias from an incorrect prescription has significant consequences for interpreting kilonovae, their use as additional components in gamma-ray burst afterglows, and understanding their role in cosmic chemical evolution or for multi-messenger constraints on the nuclear equation of state. We showcase a framework and tool to better determine the impact of different modelling assumptions and uncertainties on inferences into kilonova properties.</description>

      <title>The origin of the coherent radio flash potentially associated with GRB 201006A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rowlinson et al. 2023 recently claimed the detection of a coherent radio flash 76.6 minutes after a short gamma-ray burst. They proposed that the radio emission may be associated with a long-lived neutron star engine. We show through theoretical and observational arguments that the coherent radio emission, if real and indeed associated with GRB 201006A and at the estimated redshift, is unlikely to be due to the collapse of the neutron star, ruling out a blitzar-like mechanism. Instead, we show if a long-lived engine was created, it must have been stable with the radio emission likely linked to the intrinsic magnetar activity. However, we find that the optical upper limits require fine-tuning to be consistent with a magnetar-driven kilonova: we show that neutron-star engines that do satisfy the optical constraints would have produced a bright kilonova afterglow that should already be observable by the VLA or MeerKAT (for ambient densities typical for short GRBs). Given the optical limits and the current lack of a kilonova afterglow, we instead posit that no neutron star survived the merger, and the coherent radio emission was produced far from a black hole central engine via mechanisms such as synchrotron maser or magnetic reconnection in the jet -- a scenario consistent with all observations. We encourage future radio follow-up to probe the engine of this exciting event and continued prompt radio follow-up of short GRBs.</description>

      <title>Decade-long periodicity study of 2FHL blazars with historical optical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent investigation, we utilized a century's worth of archival optical data to search for a decade-long periodicity from the blazar PG 1553+113, finding a hint of a 22-yr period. Building on this foundation, the current study extends our analysis to include 10 blazars from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope Second Catalog of Hard Sources (2FHL) catalogue to uncover similar long-term periodic behaviour. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we consider the impact of observational limitations, such as temporal gaps and uneven sampling, which could potentially introduce artefacts or false periodic signals. Our analysis initially identifies decade-scale periodicity in four of these blazars (AP Librae, MKN 421, MKN 501, PG 1246+586). However, further investigation reveals that three of these are likely influenced by noise and poor sampling. The most promising candidate, approximately 51 $\pm$ 9 yr signal in MKN 421, corresponds to fewer than three full cycles and cannot be considered significant. Furthermore, global significance suggests none of the candidate periodicities meet the threshold for statistical significance. These results underscore the importance of accounting for sampling artefacts and highlight the need for robust methodologies in long-term periodicity searches.</description>

Abstract: Context. A small number of pulsar glitches have been identified as anti-glitches or spin-down glitches, where the overall contribution to the pulsar's rotation frequency is negative. A notable example of a spin-down glitch was observed in PSR 1522-5735, a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar discovered by blind searches in the 3-year data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Aims. This work aims to search for PSR 1522-5735's glitches using Fermi-LAT data from over 15 years of observations. Methods. The weighted H-test statistic was applied to identify glitches and evaluate the related changes in pulsar's spin parameters. The timing solution based on these results was further refined by maximization of the unbinned likelihood. The Bayesian information criterion was used to set an appropriate number of parameters in the timing solution to avoid overfitting. Results. The analysis revealed eight glitch events: regular spin-up glitch, spin-up glitch over-recovered to a spin-down and six anti-glitches. These events were radiatively quiet, exhibiting no significant variations in the shape of the pulse profile or energy flux. Conclusions. The results may suggest that an internal mechanism is responsible for spin-down glitch phenomena.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

Abstract: With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curve Reconstruction: A Comparative Machine and Deep Learning Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at large redshifts, are probes of the evolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. To this end, we need tight (with small dispersion) correlations among key parameters. To reduce such a dispersion, we will mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs), including the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti relation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) to its luminosity (La). We reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba, Fourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman filter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods are compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 545 GRBs. MLP and Bi-Mamba outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter uncertainties by 25.9% for log Ta, 28.6% for log Fa, and 37.7% for {\alpha} (the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross validation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Bi-Mamba achieved the lowest uncertainty of parameters, a 33.3% reduction in log Ta, a 33.6% reduction in log Fa and a 41.9% in {\alpha}, but with a higher MSE of 0.130. Bi-Mamba brings the lowest outlier percentage for log Ta and log Fa (2.70%), while MLP carries {\alpha} outliers to 0.900%. The other methods yield MSE values ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision are needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and predict GRB redshifts through machine learning.</description>

      <title>The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep-stacking for High-energy Neutrino Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the brightest high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, the further detection of fainter sources is more challenging. A natural solution is to combine fainter source candidates, and instead of individual detections, aim to identify and learn about the properties of a larger population. Due to the discreteness of high-energy neutrinos, they can be detected from distant very faint sources as well, making a statistical search benefit from the combination of a large number of distant sources, a called deep-stacking. Here we show that a Bayesian framework is well-suited to carry out such statistical probes, both in terms of detection and property reconstruction. After presenting an introductory explanation to the relevant Bayesian methodology, we demonstrate its utility in parameter reconstruction in a simplified case, and in delivering superior sensitivity compared to a maximum likelihood search in a realistic simulation.</description>

      <title>Can the neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 have a coronal origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the first astrophysical source associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and it has emerged as the second-most-prominent hotspot in the neutrino sky over ten years of observations. Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been attributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a significant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced in the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in TXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario, focusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a high-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard accretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process necessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally motivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict the emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength and neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from this AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred location for neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of 10 TeV-10 PeV neutrinos from our Universe. This flux of unknown origin most likely emanates from an extragalactic population of neutrino sources, which are individually too faint to appear as bright emitters. We review constraints on extragalactic neutrino source populations based on the non-detection of the brightest neutrino source. Extending previous work, we discuss limitations of source populations based on general neutrino luminosity functions. Our method provides more conservative but also statistically more robust predictions for the expected number of observable sources. We also show that the combined search of the brightest neutrino sources via weighted stacking searches or the analysis of non-Poissonian fluctuations in event-count histograms can improve the discovery potential by a factor of 2-3 relative to the brightest source.</description>

      <title>The role of wind asphericity in dynamical friction</title>

Abstract: Dynamical friction (DF) may affect the dynamics of stars moving through dense media. This is the case for stars and compact objects (COs) crossing active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs, stellar clusters, and common envelopes (CE), driving stellar migration. DF may decelerate the moving stellar object and may also, under certain conditions, produce an acceleration. In this paper, we study the DF and its effects in the interaction between a star and the ambient gaseous medium through a set of two-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical simulations using a wind tunnel configuration. Three different stellar wind configurations are considered: isotropic, polar, and equatorial. We confirm that the DF can decelerate and accelerate the star and find the critical value of the normalized velocity ($u_c$) that marks the transition between these regimes, for the three wind profiles. The value of $u_c$ for the isotropic wind differs slightly from that obtained in the thin shell approximation; for an aspherical wind, it may either be larger or smaller. Aspherical winds with small $u$ values produce larger accelerations than isotropic winds, while at high $u$ values, they lead to greater deceleration than the isotropic case. The timescale for DF to substantially affect the velocity of a stellar object is calculated. It is shown to be relevant in AGN discs and CEs.</description>

      <title>Flavor composition of supernova neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the flavor composition of neutrinos from supernovae is a challenging task, primarily due to the high neutrino densities at their core. In such an environment, neutrino self-interactions give rise to collective effects that have dramatic yet poorly understood consequences for their flavor evolution. In this paper, however, we show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of supernovae can significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux. We assume that, since a large number of neutrinos undergo different evolutions within the core, their state upon entering the MSW-dominated region is affected by decoherence. This assumption simplifies the problem and suggests that the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase in the case of normal mass ordering. In contrast, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e} \approx 1/3$). These predictions, and consequently their underlying assumptions, could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from supernovae.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic variance on PTAs anisotropy searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) by measuring the perturbations that this background induces in the time-of-arrivals of pulsar signals. These perturbations are expected to be correlated across different pulsars and, for isotropic GWBs, the expected values of these correlations (obtained by averaging over different GWB realizations) are a simple function of the pulsars' angular separations, known as the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation function. On the other hand, anisotropic GWBs would induce deviations from these HD correlations in a way that can be used to search for anisotropic distributions of the GWB power. However, even for isotropic GWBs, interference between GW sources radiating at overlapping frequencies induces deviations from the HD correlation pattern, an effect known in the literature as "cosmic variance". In this work, we study the impact of cosmic variance on PTA anisotropy searches. We find that the fluctuations in cross-correlations related to cosmic variance can lead to the miss-classification of isotropic GWBs as anisotropic, leading to a false detection rate of ~50% for frequentist anisotropy searches. We also observe that cosmic variance complicates the reconstruction of the GWB sky map, making it more challenging to resolve bright GW hotspots, like the ones expected to be produced from a Supermassive Black Hole Binaries population. These findings highlight the need to refine anisotropy search techniques to improve our ability to reconstruct the GWB sky map and accurately assess the significance of any isotropy deviations we might find in it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-to-$\gamma$-ray signals, recently found narrowly confined near the characteristic $2.4R_{500}$ scaled radii of galaxy clusters and groups, have been associated with their virial (structure-formation accretion) shocks based on spectro-spatial characteristics. By stacking high-latitude GMIMS radio data around MCXC galaxy clusters, we identify ($3\sigma$--$4\sigma$) excess radially polarized emission at the exact same scaled radius, providing directional support, and indicating tangential magnetic fields induced by the shocked inflow. The results suggest a strong mass dependence, a flat energy spectrum, and a high polarization fraction, consistent with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by strong virial shocks. The narrow radial range of such stacked virial-shock signals suggests that although the shocks are theorized to have diverse, irregular morphologies, they share similar $\sim2.4R_{500}$ minimal radii.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can account for the observed dark matter (DM) of the Universe and if their masses are at the eV scale, they can decay into infrared, optical and ultraviolet photons with a decay lifetime larger than the age of the Universe.We analyze multi-wavelength data obtained from the central region of Messier 87 (M87) galaxy by several telescopes, such as, Swift, Astrosat, Kanata, Spitzer and International Ultraviolet Explorer in the infrared to ultraviolet frequencies ($\sim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm Hz} - 3\times10^{15}$ Hz), to constrain the narrow emission lines indicative of the eV scale ALP DM decay. We derive constraints on the ALP coupling to two photons ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}$) for ALP mass range $2 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$, assuming ALPs form the DM in the M87 halo. We find that our bounds on ALP-two-photon coupling can become stronger than the existing ones by an order of magnitude in the ALP mass range $8 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

Abstract: The study of regular black holes and black hole mimickers as alternatives to standard black holes has recently gained significant attention, driven both by the need to extend general relativity to describe black hole interiors, and by recent advances in observational technologies. Despite considerable progress in this field, significant challenges remain in identifying and characterizing physically well-motivated classes of regular black holes and black hole mimickers. This report provides an overview of these challenges, and outlines some of the promising research directions -- as discussed during a week-long focus programme held at the Institute for Fundamental Physics of the Universe (IFPU) in Trieste from November 11th to 15th, 2024.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part II. Space-time evolution of linear instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow flavor evolution (defined as driven by neutrino masses and not necessarily ``slow'') is receiving fresh attention in the context of compact astrophysical environments. In Part~I of this series, we have studied the slow-mode dispersion relation following our recently developed analogy to plasma waves. The concept of resonance between flavor waves in the linear regime and propagating neutrinos is the defining feature of this approach. It is best motivated for weak instabilities, which probably is the most relevant regime in self-consistent astrophysical environments because these will try to eliminate the cause of instability. We here go beyond the dispersion relation alone (which by definition applies to infinite media) and consider the group velocities of unstable modes that determines whether the instability relaxes within the region where it first appears (absolute), or away from it (convective). We show that all weak instabilities are convective so that their further evolution is not local. Therefore, studying their consequences numerically in small boxes from given initial conditions may not always be appropriate.</description>

      <title>Collective flavor conversions are interactions of neutrinos with quantized flavor waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

Abstract: Advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of photon frequencies and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a photon ring oscillation that follows the period of that of the dilaton field. As the dilaton mass increases, this oscillation becomes suppressed due to the washout effect of the dilaton-induced correction term over the light path integration. We further evaluated the observability of such dilaton-induced photon ring oscillations with current radio interferometric capabilities. Our estimates indicate that this effect could potentially constrain the dilaton-photon coupling to $g_{\phi\gamma}\lesssim 10^{-11}\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for dilaton masses $\mu \lesssim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>

Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind to explain the 16000 km s$^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>
