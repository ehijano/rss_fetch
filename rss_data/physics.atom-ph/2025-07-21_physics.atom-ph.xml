      <title>Splitting of the three-body F\"orster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\"orster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the F\"orster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.</description>

      <title>Transportable strontium lattice clock with $4 \times 10^{-19}$ blackbody radiation shift uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a transportable optical lattice clock based on the $^1\mathrm{S}_0 \rightarrow {^3\mathrm{P}_0}$ transition of lattice-trapped $^{87}$Sr atoms with a total systematic uncertainty of $2.1 \times 10^{-18}$. The blackbody radiation shift, which is the leading systematic effect in many strontium lattice clocks, is controlled at the level of $4.0 \times 10^{-19}$, as the atoms are interrogated inside a well-characterised, cold thermal shield. Using a transportable clock laser, the clock reaches a frequency instability of about $5 \times 10^{-16}/\sqrt{\tau/\mathrm{s}}$, which enables fast reevaluations of systematic effects. By comparing this clock to the primary caesium fountain clocks CSF1 and CSF2 at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, we measure the clock transition frequency with a fractional uncertainty of $1.9\times 10^{-16}$, in agreement with previous results. The clock was successfully transported and operated at different locations. It holds the potential to be used for geodetic measurements with centimetre-level or better height resolution and for accurate inter-institute frequency comparisons.</description>

      <title>A large-momentum-transfer Raman atom interferometer without $k$-reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Raman atom interferometer using large momentum transfer without reversing the direction of the effective wavevector ($k$-reversal). More specifically, we use a microwave $\pi$/2 pulse to manipulate the spin state of $^{87}$Rb atoms before applying a Raman light $\pi$ pulse to achieve 4$\hbar k$ momentum transfer per Raman light pulse. A microwave $\pi$ pulse in the middle of the interferometer sequence reverses the spin states, which allows closing of the interferometer arms by the same Raman light $\pi$ pulses without propagation reversal. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a 4$\hbar k$ large-momentum-transfer (LMT) atom interferometer and discuss its scalability. Our results extend the scope of using LMT atom optics.</description>

      <title>Nebular spectra of kilonovae with detailed recombination rates -- I. Light r-process composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t &gt;=1week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic (DR) and radiative (RR) recombination rates for the light r-process elements: Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the total rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 10^-13-10^-9 cm^3/s, 10^-12-10^-10 cm^3/s, and 10^-13-10^-10 cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. We also provide fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections of the various ions, finding larger and more slowly declining values with energy in comparison to the hydrogenic approximation. Using this new atomic data, we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 mum) and optical (e.g. [Rb I] 7802, 7949 A) lines disappear in the new model. Instead a strong [Se I] line is seen to be emerging at lambda=5.03 mum. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.</description>
