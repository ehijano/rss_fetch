      <title>Performance evaluation of an offshore wave measurement buoy in monochromatic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of waves underpins marine energy resource characterization, device design, and project development. Datawell wave buoys are widely deployed around the world and have long served as a trusted standard for wave measurements. We quantify the measurement performance, including wave elevation and energy flux estimation, of a Datawell DWR-MkIII buoy using prescribed monochromatic heave motions on a large-amplitude six-degree-of-freedom motion platform at the National Laboratory of the Rockies, assuming the buoy behaves as an ideal wave follower. Commanded motions were validated with an optical motion tracking system while buoy elevation and raw acceleration were recorded. Wave elevations were propagated to wave energy flux estimation using four methods, including one frequency-domain method and three time-domain methods. The Bayesian optimization was applied for design of experiments, and records from three test sites were also applied and evaluated in the present study. Results show two error regions within the nominal period range of 1.6s to 30s}. For wave periods between 5s and 25s, the buoy provides accurate wave height measurements. For short periods less than 5s, the 1.28Hz sampling frequency induces sub-Nyquist artifacts that bias elevation and can drive maximum energy flux estimation errors above 100%. For long periods exceeding 25s, the buoy reported elevation is underpredicted with error depending on period but relatively independent of wave height, with maximum wave height and wave energy flux errors reaching 64% and 87%, respectively. The analysis of field data also indicates that the currently recommended method for estimating wave energy flux may underestimate the wave energy flux.</description>

      <title>High-resolution calorimetric sample platforms for cryogenic thermodynamic studies with multimodal synchrotron x-ray compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray calorimetric sample platforms combining specific heat and synchrotron x-ray measurements provide a powerful means to investigate fundamental material properties. Calorimeter cell designs featuring a compact heater and thermometer arranged in a sidecar geometry, with the sample positioned directly above the heater at the center of a silicon nitride membrane, are presented. High-yield, wafer-level batch fabrication of precision calorimetric sensor chips, beamline and laboratory cryostat plugins with sensor mounting and packaging are described. Using our calorimetric sensors, we present specific heat measurements on samples with masses ranging from 4 {\mu}g to 145 {\mu}g. The sample and reference cells are characterized with relaxation and ac steady-state measurements. The thermal response is captured using lock-in detection at carefully optimized measurement frequencies, with phase-lag correction ensuring precise extraction of heat capacity. The reference cell's background heat capacity was measured to be under 320 nJ/K at 300 K, decreasing to just 0.4 nJ/K at 0.7 K. The calorimeter performance is illustrated by studying the specific heat of small samples of superconducting Nb and a 4 {\mu}g piece of superconducting Al under different magnetic field strengths. The determination of fundamental thermodynamic quantities from low-temperature electronic and lattice specific heat measurements is discussed. These versatile, high-throughput sample platforms are engineered for small-sample calorimetry across a broad cryogenic temperature range, and they support scalable integration with a wide range of cryostats, including beamline cryostats at the Advanced Photon Source. They accommodate multimodal geometries and enable operation under ultra-high vacuum, millikelvin temperatures, magnetic fields, and x-ray illumination.</description>

      <title>A Wide Bandwidth Trans-impedance Amplifier for Picosecond-Scale SiPM Characterization in a Wide Temperature Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future high-energy physics experiments using SiPMs as photosensitive elements may require operation at low temperatures (down to 80 K) to measure single photons with high time resolution in a highly radioactive environment. This calls for a complete characterization of these sensors over a wide temperature range to find the best compromise between detector performance and cooling requirements. This paper presents the design of a transimpedance amplifier featuring high gain ($\sim 7500$ $\mathrm{V/A}$), very high speed ($ &lt; 500$ $\mathrm{ps}$ rise time) and low input noise ($\lesssim 0.2$ $\mathrm{pA/\sqrt{Hz}}$), able to faithfully reproduce all the features of SiPM signals with very low noise and time jitter. These features make the amplifier suitable for precise measurements of the time-of-arrival of single-photon signals, as well as gain and recovery time. This article provides a detailed and thorough analysis of the circuit. The network was simulated and measured in two configurations that differ in their open-loop gain and dominant pole frequencies. After selecting the best configuration for our purposes, the amplifier was characterized in detail at ambient temperature and at 80 K. Finally, we evaluated the amplifier using a SiPM operated at low over-voltage. While SiPMs are typically characterized at high over-voltage to enhance gain and minimize timing jitter, testing at low over-voltage allowed us to assess the amplifier's performance under more challenging and realistic conditions for single-photon timing.</description>

      <title>Simulation and optimization of the Active Magnetic Shield of the n2EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute aims to conduct a high-sensitivity search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Magnetic stability and control are achieved through a combination of passive shielding, provided by a magnetically shielded room (MSR), and a surrounding active field compensation system by an Active Magnetic Shield (AMS). The AMS is a feedback-controlled system of eight coils spanned on an irregular grid, designed to provide magnetic stability to the enclosed volume by actively suppressing external magnetic disturbances. It can compensate static and variable magnetic fields up to $\pm 50$ $\mu$T (homogeneous components) and $\pm 5$ $\mu$T/m (first-order gradients), suppressing them to a few $\mu$T in the sub-Hertz frequency range. We present a full finite element simulation of magnetic fields generated by the AMS in the presence of the MSR. This simulation is of sufficient accuracy to approach our measurements. We demonstrate how the simulation can be used with an example, obtaining an optimal number and placement of feedback sensors using genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>High-bandwidth frequency domain multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensors for neutrinoless double beta decay searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation of cryogenic neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments require increasingly fast readout in order to improve background discrimination. These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\sim$100 $\mu$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz. We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor. Each multiplexing readout module comprises ten superconducting resonators in the MHz range and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), interfaced to high-bandwidth field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronics for digital signal processing and low-latency feedback.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional squeezing of optically levitated nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to measure impulses beyond the standard quantum limit. The protocol reduces noise in all three spatial dimensions and consists of squeezing a mechanical system's state via a series of jumps in the frequency of the harmonic potential. We quantify how decoherence in a realistic system of an optically levitated, dielectric nanoparticle limits the ultimate sensitivity. We predict that $\sim$10 dB of squeezing is achievable with current technology, enabling quantum-enhanced detection of weak impulses.</description>

      <title>Establishing Earth's Matter Effect in Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-zero value of $\theta_{13}$ has opened an exciting opportunity to probe the Earth's matter effects in three-flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos. These matter effects depend on both neutrino energy and the electron density distributions encountered during their propagation through Earth. In this contribution, we present preliminary sensitivities from the DeepCore detector, a densely instrumented sub-array of the IceCube neutrino observatory at the South Pole, demonstrating its ability to observe these matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Using simulated data equivalent to 9.3 years of observations at IceCube DeepCore, we show the sensitivity of the DeepCore to reject the vacuum oscillation hypothesis and align with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. Additionally, we present the expected improvement in sensitivity for rejecting the vacuum oscillations using the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, a low-energy extension of the IceCube detector.</description>

      <title>Exploring Layered Structure Inside Earth Using Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillation at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube detector, using its densely instrumented center, called DeepCore, can detect multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos. The oscillation pattern of neutrinos is altered due to interactions with ambient electrons as they pass through Earth. The changes in these patterns are influenced by the amount of matter and its specific arrangement. As neutrinos propagate, they retain information about the densities they encounter. Our study demonstrates that IceCube DeepCore can utilize the Earth's matter effects to distinguish between a homogeneous matter density profile and a layered structure density profile of Earth. In this contribution, we present that IceCube DeepCore data equivalent to 9.3 years of observation can reject the homogeneous matter density profile with a confidence level of 1.4$\sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's mass and internal structure have been primarily studied through gravitational and seismic methods. Neutrinos, however, offer an independent way to explore Earth's interior via matter effects in neutrino oscillations that depend on the electron distribution inside Earth, and hence its matter density. Our study uses atmospheric neutrinos at DeepCore, a densely instrumented sub-detector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, to estimate Earth's mass and layer densities. We also assess how the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, with denser instrumentation, could improve these measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring Long-Range Interactions in the Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_\mu$ or $L_e - L_\tau$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the IceCube DeepCore detector to search for this flavor-dependent long-range interaction potential with a runtime of 9.3 years.</description>

      <title>A centimeter-sized gas pressure sensor for high-vacuum measurements at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas pressure sensors based on nanomechanical membranes have recently demonstrated an ultra-wide ten-decade measurement range, a gas-type-independent response, and a self-calibrating operation with uncertainties of approximately $1\,\%$. The readout relied on tabletop free-space laser interferometers. Here we present a centimeter-sized, portable implementation in which a square Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane is read out via a fiber-based laser interferometer. We perform pressure measurements between $5\times10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1}$~mbar in a confined $0.7$~L volume cooled to $78$~K. Because no suitable commercial pressure sensor exists for direct cryogenic comparison, we benchmark our device against room-temperature commercial gauges connected to the cold volume through a pipe of limited conductance. The measured relationship between the two sensors is compared with models accounting for temperature- and pumping-induced pressure gradients within the measurement chamber. These models agree with the measurements to within $&lt;10\,\%$ for helium and $&lt;13\,\%$ for nitrogen. The achieved readout sensitivity of $S_x = 8\times10^{-14}\,\mathrm{m}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ theoretically enables resolving the thermal displacement noise spectrum of a trampoline membrane at atmospheric pressure, with a peak response of $48\,S_x$ $\left(25\,S_x\right)$ at $295\,\mathrm{K}$ $\left(78\,\mathrm{K}\right)$. Our results suggest that the previously achieved pressure measurement range of ten decades with trampoline membranes is compatible with fiber-based optical readout. This paves the way for widely applicable pressure sensors in the centimeter size range in cryogenic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Beam-test evaluation of pre-production Low Gain Avalanche Detectors for the ATLAS High Granularity Timing Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) will be installed in the ATLAS experiment as part of the Phase-II upgrade for the High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It will mitigate pile-up effects in the forward region, and measure per bunch luminosity. The design of HGTD is based on Low Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) sensors. This paper presents the results of beam-test campaigns conducted at CERN and DESY in 2023 and 2024 on single LGADs from HGTD pre-production test structures, before and after neutron irradiation up to fluences of $2.5 \times 10^{15}~\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^2}$. The tested LGADs can meet HGTD requirements in terms of charge collection, time resolution, and hit efficiency, even under HL-LHC end-of-life conditions, supporting their deployment in the final detector.</description>

      <title>Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured $z$-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS in closed loop. This approach obviates the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. Our laboratory experiments validate tip/tilt estimation and correction using nlCWFS data, achieving tip/tilt accuracy of +/-0.1, lambda/D for an unaberrated beam and better than ~+/-0.5, lambda/D in the presence of aberrations, consistent with prior numerical simulations. We further demonstrate a closed-loop tip/tilt control implementation and show a qualitative improvement in the stability and overall quality of multi-plane phase retrieval reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.</description>
