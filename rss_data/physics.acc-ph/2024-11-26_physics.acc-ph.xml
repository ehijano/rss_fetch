      <title>Advances in understanding vacuum break dynamics in liquid helium-cooled tubes for accelerator beamline applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding air propagation and condensation following a catastrophic vacuum break in particle accelerator beamlines cooled by liquid helium is essential for ensuring operational safety. This review summarizes experimental and theoretical work conducted in our cryogenics lab to address this issue. Systematic measurements were performed to study nitrogen gas propagation in uniform copper tubes cooled by both normal liquid helium (He I) and superfluid helium (He II). These experiments revealed a nearly exponential deceleration of the gas front, with stronger deceleration observed in He II-cooled tubes. To interpret these results, a one-dimensional (1D) theoretical model was developed, incorporating gas dynamics, heat transfer, and condensation mechanisms. The model successfully reproduced key experimental observations in the uniform tube system. However, recent experiments involving a bulky copper cavity designed to mimic the geometry of a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavity revealed strong anisotropic flow patterns of nitrogen gas within the cavity, highlighting limitations in extrapolating results from simplified tube geometries to real accelerator beamlines. To address these complexities, we outline plans for systematic studies using tubes with multiple bulky cavities and the development of a two-dimensional (2D) model to simulate gas dynamics in these more intricate configurations. These efforts aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of vacuum breaks in particle accelerators and improve predictive capabilities for their operational safety.</description>

      <title>Generation of circular field harmonics in quasi-polygonal magnet apertures using superconducting canted-cosine-theta coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting magnets with non-circular apertures are important for handling unconventional beam profiles and specialized accelerator applications. This paper presents an analytical framework for designing superconducting accelerator magnets with quasi-polygonal apertures, aimed at generating precise circular field harmonics. In Part 1, we explore the relationship between current distributions on quasi-polygonal formers and their corresponding magnetic field harmonics. By employing conformal mapping techniques, we establish a connection between the design of quasi-polygonal bore magnets and traditional circular bore configurations, facilitating the simplification of complex mathematical formulations. Part 2 applies the derived current distributions to the canted cosine theta (CCT) coil magnet concept, focusing on designing analytic winding schemes that generate single or mixed circular harmonics within quasi-polygonal apertures. This work not only advances the design of superconducting magnets but also broadens the scope of CCT technology to accommodate more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Dosimetry study of high repetition rate MeV electron beam from a continuous-wave photocathode gun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC-SRF-II gun, a high-brightness continuous-wave photocathode gun, has greater potential in electron beam irradiation applications. This paper presents the in-vacuum and in-air irradiation dosimetry study of the high repetition rate electron beam from the DC-SRF-II gun with both Monte Carlo simulations and experiments. Especially, high-dose uniform irradiations with flexible and accurate tuning of dose rate across orders of magnitude are demonstrated. Good stability and repeatability of the doses are also shown. The ultra-wide tuning range and precise control of irradiation time and dose rate are expected to pave the way for innovative applications across a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Simulation Results of Dielectric Laser Acceleration of Non-relativistic Electrons in Transparent and Reflective Periodic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support of our experimental studies on dielectric laser acceleration, numerical studies of laser acceleration of nonrelativistic electrons with the initial energy of 33.9 keV in transparent and reflective periodic structures are car-ried out. On the basis of computer simulations, the acceleration rates of electrons and the quality of their beams after acceleration in compact structures of different configurations were determined and compared. Prospective acceleration schemes are proposed, in particular with reflective periodic structures, which can provide higher rates of electron acceleration in periodic structures than in previously obtained studies.</description>

      <title>Collective nuclear excitation and pulse propagation in single-mode x-ray waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer nuclei constitute exceptionally clean quantum-optical systems with transitions in the hard x-ray energy range, which, placed in x-ray waveguides, are a uniquely capable platform to study collective radiative effects in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this work, we design and demonstrate the so-far unexplored nuclear resonant x-ray propagation in thin-film waveguides coupled in forward incidence, resolving excitation and collective evolution of M\"ossbauer nuclei in both time and position. To describe the effects of geometry on propagation and collective evolution, we present a unifying theoretical model. Our findings not only open up a new design space for experiments in nuclear resonant scattering and nuclear quantum optics, but also demonstrate a nanometer-sized x-ray source with extreme temporal and spatial coherence. %which previously were limited to either unstructured foil samples or translation-invariant reflectivity and diffraction configurations. This gives access to a new regime of waveguide QED with hard x-rays and furthermore paves a new route to coherent spectro-microscopic investigations at the nanoscale.</description>
