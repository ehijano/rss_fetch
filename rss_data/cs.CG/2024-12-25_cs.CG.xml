      <title>Combinatorial Regularity for Relatively Perfect Discrete Morse Gradient Vector Fields of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One common function class in machine learning is the class of ReLU neural networks. ReLU neural networks induce a piecewise linear decomposition of their input space called the canonical polyhedral complex. It has previously been established that it is decidable whether a ReLU neural network is piecewise linear Morse. In order to expand computational tools for analyzing the topological properties of ReLU neural networks, and to harness the strengths of discrete Morse theory, we introduce a schematic for translating between a given piecewise linear Morse function (e.g. parameters of a ReLU neural network) on a canonical polyhedral complex and a compatible (``relatively perfect") discrete Morse function on the same complex. Our approach is constructive, producing an algorithm that can be used to determine if a given vertex in a canonical polyhedral complex corresponds to a piecewise linear Morse critical point. Furthermore we provide an algorithm for constructing a consistent discrete Morse pairing on cells in the canonical polyhedral complex which contain this vertex. We additionally provide some new realizability results with respect to sublevel set topology in the case of shallow ReLU neural networks.</description>

      <title>Shoving tubes through shapes gives a sufficient and efficient shape statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) was introduced in the field of Topological Data Analysis about 10 years ago, and has since been proven to be a very powerful descriptor of Euclidean shapes. The PHT consists of scanning a shape from all possible directions $v\in S^{n-1}$ and then computing the persistent homology of sublevel set filtrations of the respective height functions $h_v$; this results in a sufficient and continuous descriptor of Euclidean shapes. We introduce a generalisation of the PHT in which we consider arbitrary parameter spaces and sublevel sets with respect to any function. In particular, we study transforms, defined on the Grassmannian $\mathbb{A}\mathbb{G}(m,n)$ of affine subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, that allow to scan a shape by probing it with all possible affine $m$-dimensional subspaces $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, for fixed dimension $m$, and by computing persistent homology of sublevel set filtrations of the function $\mathrm{dist}(\cdot, P)$ encoding the distance from the flat $P$. We call such transforms "distance-from-flat" PHTs. We show that these transforms are injective and continuous and that they provide computational advantages over the classical PHT. In particular, we show that it is enough to compute homology only in degrees up to $m-1$ to obtain injectivity; for $m=1$ this provides a very powerful and computationally advantageous tool for examining shapes, which in a previous work by a subset of the authors has proven to significantly outperform state-of-the-art neural networks for shape classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Subsampling, aligning, and averaging to find circular coordinates in recurrent time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for finding robust circular coordinates on data that is expected to exhibit recurrence, such as that which appears in neuronal recordings of C. elegans. Techniques exist to create circular coordinates on a simplicial complex from a dimension 1 cohomology class, and these can be applied to the Rips complex of a dataset when it has a prominent class in its dimension 1 cohomology. However, it is known this approach is extremely sensitive to uneven sampling density.
  Our algorithm comes with a new method to correct for uneven sampling density, adapting our prior work on averaging coordinates in manifold learning. We use rejection sampling to correct for inhomogeneous sampling and then apply Procrustes matching to align and average the subsamples. In addition to providing a more robust coordinate than other approaches, this subsampling and averaging approach has better efficiency.
  We validate our technique on both synthetic data sets and neuronal activity recordings. Our results reveal a topological model of neuronal trajectories for C. elegans that is constructed from loops in which different regions of the brain state space can be mapped to specific and interpretable macroscopic behaviors in the worm.</description>

      <title>Guarding Polyominoes Under $k$-Hop Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Art Gallery Problem under $k$-hop visibility in polyominoes. In this visibility model, two unit squares of a polyomino can see each other if and only if the shortest path between the respective vertices in the dual graph of the polyomino has length at most $k$.
  In this paper, we show that the VC dimension of this problem is $3$ in simple polyominoes, and $4$ in polyominoes with holes. Furthermore, we provide a reduction from Planar Monotone 3Sat, thereby showing that the problem is NP-complete even in thin polyominoes (i.e., polyominoes that do not a contain a $2\times 2$ block of cells). Complementarily, we present a linear-time $4$-approximation algorithm for simple $2$-thin polyominoes (which do not contain a $3\times 3$ block of cells) for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>
