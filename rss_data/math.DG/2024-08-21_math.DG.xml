      <title>Removing scalar curvature assumption for Ricci flow smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work of Chan-Huang-Lee, it is shown that if a manifold enjoys uniform bounds on (a) the negative part of the scalar curvature, (b) the local entropy, and (c) volume ratios up to a fixed scale, then there exists a Ricci flow for some definite time with estimates on the solution assuming that the local curvature concentration is small enough initially (depending only on these a priori bounds). In this work, we show that the bound on scalar curvature assumption (a) is redundant. We also give some applications of this quantitative short-time existence, including a Ricci flow smoothing result for measure space limits, a Gromov-Hausdorff compactness result, and a topoligical and geometric rigidity result in the case that the a priori local bounds are strengthened to be global.</description>

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply methods of algebraic integral geometry to prove a special case of the Gaussian kinematic formula of Adler-Taylor. The idea, suggested already by Adler and Taylor, is to view the GKF as the limit of spherical kinematic formulas for spheres of large dimension $N$ and curvature $\frac 1 N$.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of $(2,3,5)$-distributions and associated Legendrian cone structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit a natural correspondence between holomorphic $(2,3,5)$-distributions and nondegenerate lines on holomorphic contact manifolds of dimension $5$ to present a new perspective in the study of symmetries of $(2,3,5)$-distributions. This leads to a number of new results in this classical subject, including an unexpected relation between the multiply-transitive families of models having $7$- and $6$-dimensional symmetries, and a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of nontransitive $(2,3,5)$-distributions with $6$-dimensional symmetries and nonhomogeneous nondegenerate Legendrian curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$. An ingredient for establishing the former is an explicit classification of homogeneous nondegenerate Legendrian curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$, which we present.</description>

      <title>Pluriclosed flow and the Hull-Strominger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a natural extension of pluriclosed flow aiming at constructing solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. We give several geometric formulations of this flow, which yield a series of a priori estimates for the flow and also for the Hull-Strominger system. The evolution equations are derived using the theory of string algebroids, a class of Courant algebroids which occur naturally in higher gauge theory. Using this, we interpret the flow as generalized Ricci flow and also as a higher/coupled version of Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow, proving furthermore that it is compatible with symmetry reduction. Regarding our main analytical results, we prove a priori $C^{\infty}$ estimates for uniformly parabolic solutions. This in particular settles the question of smooth regularity of uniformly elliptic solutions of the Hull-Strominger system, generalizing Yau's $C^3$ estimate for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We prove global existence and convergence results for the flow on special backgrounds, and discuss a conjectural relationship of the flow to the geometrization of Reid's fantasy.</description>

      <title>Duality of Geometric Tests for Forward-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the property of forward-flatness for discrete-time systems, which is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general concept of flatness, can be checked by two different geometric tests. One is based on unique sequences of involutive distributions, while the other is based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions. In this paper, the relation between these sequences is discussed and it is shown that the tests are in fact dual. The presented results are illustrated by an academic example.</description>

Abstract: Extensions of Lie algebras equipped with Sasakian or Frobenius-K\"ahler geometrical structures are studied. Conditions are given so that a double extension of a Sasakian Lie algebra be Sasakian again. Conditions are also given for obtaining either a Sasakian or a Frobernius-K\"ahler Lie algebra upon respectively extending a Frobernius-K\"ahler or a Sasakian Lie algebra by adjoining a derivation of the source algebra. Low-dimensional examples are included.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing and essential spectral gaps for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense $\Theta$-Anosov subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group for some nonempty subset of simple roots $\Theta$. In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space $\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows $\{a^{\mathsf{v}}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\mathsf{v}$ in the interior of the $\Theta$-limit cone $\mathcal{L}_\Theta$ of $\Gamma$, and they are H\"{o}lder conjugate to H\"{o}lder reparametrizations of the Gromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional cone $\mathscr{E} \subset \operatorname{int}\mathcal{L}_\Theta$, which is a smooth image of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to $\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a compact set of such $\mathsf{v}$. We also obtain an essential spectral gap formulated in terms of the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with a power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to prove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation flows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The exceptional cone $\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those vectors.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Bounds for Tensor Expanders on Riemannian Manifolds Using Graph Laplacian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the advancement of probability tail bound analysis, a crucial statistical tool for assessing the probability of large deviations of random variables from their expected values. Traditional tail bounds, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Chernoff bounds, have proven valuable across numerous scientific and engineering fields. However, as data complexity grows, there is a pressing need to extend tail bound estimation from scalar variables to high-dimensional random objects. Existing studies often rely on the assumption of independence among high-dimensional random objects, an assumption that may not always be valid. Building on the work of researchers like Garg et al. and Chang, who employed random walks to model high-dimensional ensembles, this study introduces a more generalized approach by exploring random walks over manifolds. To address the challenges of constructing an appropriate underlying graph for a manifold, we propose a novel method that enhances random walks on graphs approximating the manifold. This approach ensures spectral similarity between the original manifold and the approximated graph, including matching eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and eigenfunctions. Leveraging graph approximation technique proposed by Burago et al. for manifolds, we derive the tensor Chernoff bound and establish its range for random walks on a Riemannian manifold according to the underlying manifold's spectral characteristics.</description>

      <title>Uniform Convergence of Metrics on Alexandrov Surfaces with Bounded Integral Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniform convergence of metrics $g_k$ on a closed surface with bounded integral curvature (measure) in the sense of A.D. Alexandrov, under the assumption that the curvature measures $\mathbb{K}_{g_k}=\mu^1_k-\mu^2_k$, where $\mu^1_k,\mu^2_k$ are nonnegative Radon measures converging weakly to measures $\mu^1,\mu^2$ respectively, and $\mu^1$ is less than $2\pi$ at each point (no cusps). This is the global version of Yu. G. Reshetnyak's well-known result on uniform convergence of metrics on a domain in $\mathbb{C}$, and answers affirmatively the open question on the metric convergence on a closed surface. We also give an analytic proof of the fact that a (singular) metric $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with bounded integral curvature on a closed Riemannian surface $(\Sigma,g_0)$ can be approximated by smooth metrics in the fixed conformal class $[g_0]$</description>

Abstract: We examine the metric and Einstein bilinear functionals of differential forms introduced in Adv.Math.,Vol.427,(2023)1091286, for Hodge-Dirac operator $d+\delta$ on an oriented even-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We show that they reproduce these functionals for the canonical Dirac operator on a spin manifold up to a numerical factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated spectral triple is spectrally closed, which implies that it is torsion-free.</description>

      <title>Einstein manifolds with optical geometries of Kerr type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the Ricci flat Lorentzian $n$-manifolds satisfying three particular conditions, encoding and combining some crucial features of the Kerr metrics and the Robinson-Trautman optical structures. We prove that: (a) If $n&gt;4$, there is no Lorentzian manifold satisfying the considered Kerr type conditions, in unexpected contrast with what occurs for the metrics satisfying (very similar) Taub-NUT type conditions; (b) If $n=4$ there are two large classes of such Kerr type manifolds. Each class consists of manifolds fibering over open Riemann surfaces, equipped with a metric of constant Gaussian curvature $\kappa = 1$ or $\kappa = -1$. The first class includes a three parameter family of metrics admitting real analytic extensions to $(\mathbb R^3 \setminus\{0\}) \times \mathbb R = (S^2 \times \mathbb R_+) \times \mathbb R$ and a large class of other metrics not admitting this kind of extensions. The metrics of this first class admitting such extensions are all isometric to the well known Kerr metrics, with the three parameters corresponding to the three space-like components of the angular momentum of the gravitational field. The second class contains a subclass of metrics defined on $\big(\mathbb D\times \mathbb R_+\big)\times \mathbb R$, where $\mathbb D$ is the Lobachevsky Poincar\'e disc. This subclass is in bijection with the holomorphic functions on $\mathbb D$ satisfying an appropriate open condition. These and other results are consequences of a very simple way to construct totally explicit examples of Ricci flat Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of a certain regularity defined on some open subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, it is a classical problem of analysis to investigate whether the function can be extended to all of $\mathbb{R}^m$ in a certain regularity class. If an extension exists and is continuous, then certainly it is uniquely determined on the closure of $A$. A similar problem arises in general relativity for Lorentzian manifolds instead of functions on $\mathbb{R}^m$. It is well-known, however, that even if the extension of a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is analytic, various choices are in general possible at the boundary. This paper establishes a uniqueness condition for extensions of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ with a focus on low regularities: any two extensions which are anchored by an inextendible causal curve $\gamma : [-1,0) \to M$ in the sense that $\gamma$ has limit points in both extensions, must agree locally around those limit points on the boundary as long as the extensions are at least locally Lipschitz continuous. We also show that this is sharp: anchored extensions which are only H\"older continuous do in general not enjoy this local uniqueness result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity, we construct a bihamiltonian integrable hierarchy of hydrodynamic type which is an analogue of the Principal Hierarchy of a Frobenius manifold. We show that such an integrable hierarchy, which we also call the Principal Hierarchy, possesses Virasoro symmetries and a tau structure, and the Virasoro symmetries can be lifted to symmetries of the tau-cover of the integrable hierarchy. We derive the loop equation from the condition of linearization of actions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function, and construct the topological deformation of the Principal Hierarchy of a semisimple generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity. We also give two examples of generalized Frobenius manifolds with non-flat unity and show that they are closely related to the well-known integrable hierarchies: the Volterra hierarchy, the q-deformed KdV hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a trilinear functional of differential one-forms for a finitely summable regular spectral triple with a noncommutative residue. We demonstrate that for a canonical spectral triple over a closed spin manifold it recovers the torsion of the linear connection. We examine several spectral triples, including Hodge-de\,Rham, Einstein-Yang-Mills, almost-commutative two-sheeted space, conformally rescaled noncommutative tori, and quantum $SU(2)$ group, showing that the third one has a nonvanishing torsion if nontrivially coupled.</description>

Abstract: We prove that in any fixed dimension, K-semistable log Fano cone singularities whose volumes are bounded from below by a fixed positive number form a bounded set. As a consequence, we show that the set of local volumes of klt singularities of a fixed dimension has zero as the only accumulation point.</description>
