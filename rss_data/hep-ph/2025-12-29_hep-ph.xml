      <title>Probing gluon saturation with forward di-hadron correlations in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical investigation of semi-inclusive forward di-hadron production in proton-nucleus collisions employing the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We focus on the regime where di-hadrons are produced nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane, thereby justifying a transverse-momentum-dependent factorization approach in terms of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Our computation integrates several key elements: i) non-linear rapidity evolution via the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with running coupling, ii) both perturbative and non-perturbative Sudakov resummation, and iii) a phenomenologically constrained model for the initial conditions for small-$x$ gluon distributions. We compare this phenomenological framework to experimental data from the STAR Collaboration on azimuthal correlations in forward di-pion production in both proton-proton and proton-gold collisions. We analyze the systematic theoretical uncertainties associated with the saturation scales of nuclei at the initial scale for rapidity evolution and with those associated with the hadronization process. Finally, we make predictions for the kinematics anticipated to be covered by the ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Viability of Sub-TeV Higgsino Dark Matter with Slepton Coannihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higgsino-like neutralino is a compelling dark matter candidate motivated by both cosmology and naturalness considerations. While a pure higgsino typically requires a mass of around $1.1~\mathrm{TeV}$ to satisfy the observed thermal relic abundance, the presence of light sleptons can significantly alter this requirement. In this work, we revisit higgsino dark matter within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), focusing on scenarios with slepton coannihilation. We find that efficient coannihilation allows the higgsino mass to be as light as $\sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$ while satisfying relic density constraints. We explicitly contrast the impact of recent direct detection updates: the LZ-2022 limits raise this lower bound to approximately $450~\mathrm{GeV}$, while the stringent LZ-2024 constraints further shift the viable mass floor to $\sim 500~\mathrm{GeV}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the direct detection sensitivity is strongly dependent on the relative signs of the gaugino mass parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$. We find that scenarios with $M_1, M_2 &gt; 0$ are fully excluded by LZ-2024. Conversely, configurations with opposite signs ($M_1/M_2 &lt; 0$) remain broadly viable, as destructive interference in the neutralino-Higgs coupling efficiently suppresses the spin-independent cross section. Finally, we delineate the remaining viable parameter space for both the opposite-sign cases and the specific configurations with negative $M_1$ and $M_2$.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with Non-Invertible Selection Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which the quark and lepton flavor structure and suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are governed by non-invertible selection rules. By implementing such non-group-like fusion rules for matter fields, arising from gauging the outer automorphism $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, we obtain realistic Yukawa textures that reproduce the observed quark and lepton masses and mixings while ensuring diagonal soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking masses and hence suppressing dangerous FCNC processes. We analyze mass insertion parameters under random $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients and find that all flavor-violating effects are consistent with experimental limits on processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$ and meson mixings. We show that the Yukawa textures and soft terms remain stable under renormalization group evolution. Our results demonstrate that non-invertible selection rules provide a compelling new mechanism to address both the flavor structure and FCNC problems in supersymmetric models.</description>

      <title>The Compact X and Z and their Invisible Molecular Partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model explaining the strong isospin violations observed in X(3872) decays. The X is assumed to be a compact isosinglet tetraquark and its charged partners to form an isotriplet, together with an additional neutral state mixing with the isosinglet. The isotriplet results from the loose binding of open charm mesons and, in isolation, has strongly suppressed production rates. However, its neutral component can still mix with the isosinglet and induce the large isospin violations observed. The compact-isosinglet/molecular-isotriplet pattern appears reversed when the Z(3900) resonances are considered. The Z particles observed correspond to a compact isotriplet and there is no evidence of a neutral isosinglet Z. We show that no isospin violation in the Z decays is expected.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning jet flavor tagging for precision hadronic Higgs measurements at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of Higgs decays into quarks and gluons are essential for probing the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson and testing the flavor structure of the Standard Model. We investigate the process $e^+e^- \to ZH$ at $\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}$ at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory, taking the CEPC design as a benchmark. The analysis focuses on events with $Z\to\nu\bar\nu$ and hadronic Higgs decays $H\to b\bar b$, $c\bar c$, $s\bar s$ and $gg$. Jet flavor is identified using state-of-the-art particle-level deep neural network taggers (ParticleNet, Particle Transformer and More-Interaction Particle Transformer), whose per-jet outputs are combined with global event observables in a two-stage analysis employing XGBoost classifiers to separate the four Higgs decay modes from the dominant two- and four-fermion Standard Model backgrounds. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $20\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$, we obtain projected relative precision on $\sigma(ZH)\times\mathrm{Br}(H\to X)$ of 0.18% for $X=b\bar b$, 1.07% for $c\bar c$, 0.52% for $gg$ and 78% for $s\bar s$. Compared with the CEPC published results, the precisions for $H\to c\bar c$ and $H\to gg$ are improved by about $42%$ and $26%$, respectively. For $H\to s\bar s$ we present a quantitative sensitivity estimation corresponding to a statistical significance of about $1.3\sigma$. These results highlight the potential of deep-learning-based jet flavor tagging for precision studies of Higgs decays at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole scattering: summing large Pomeron loops in non-linear evolution with leading twist kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown in this paper that the QCD equations for dipole density have the natural solution: the 'fan' diagrams of the Pomeron calculus. We found the dipole densities comparing the analytic solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation for the simplified leading twist kernel with the $t$ channel unitarity. Using these densities we calculate the contributions of large Pomeron loops to dipole-dipole scattering at high energies. Applying the Abramovsky,Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found that the produced gluons are distributed accordingly the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) law which leads to the entropy $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$ in an agreement with Kharzeev - Levin predictions.</description>

      <title>Kaon T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions and form factors in a self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) for the kaon based on the Bakamjian--Thomas (BT) construction and apply it to the electromagnetic and scalar form factors, as well as the full set of unpolarized T-even transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) and their collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). A uniform use of the invariant mass $M_0$ in both hadronic matrix elements and Lorentz prefactors enforces four-momentum conservation at the meson--quark vertex and yields current-component--independent observables, removing light-front zero-mode ambiguities. Properly normalized electromagnetic form factor $F_{K^+}(Q^2)$ is exemplified as a current-component--independent observable by verifying its uniqueness with the explicit computation from all the available components ($\gamma^+$, $\gamma^\perp$, and $\gamma^-$) of the current. In the scalar channel, we compare the direct $f_S(Q^2)$ and mass-factored $F_S(Q^2)$ definitions and show they are not interchangeable within the BT-based LFQM because $M\to M_0(x,{\bf k}_\perp)$ must be implemented inside the integral. Using a Gaussian form for the light-front wave function, the twist-2 TMD $f_1^q$ becomes exactly Gaussian in ${\bf k}_\perp$, while higher-twist TMDs ($f^{\perp q}$, $e^q$, $f_4^q$) display systematic twist/flavor hierarchies, including an elliptic deformation of $f_4^q$ tied to $\gamma^-$ component. The BT-based LFQM satisfies the forward-limit sum rule for $f_4^q(x)$. We further analyze the perturbative QCD evolution of the valence PDFs for the pion and kaon and report their Mellin moments at representative scales, enabling direct comparison with phenomenology. Overall, the BT-based LFQM provides a unified, current-independent description of meson structure and a consistent bridge from nonperturbative light-front dynamics to evolved collinear PDFs.</description>

      <title>Determination of the HERA coherent diffractive $J/\psi$ production cross section via artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exclusive coherent diffractive $J/\psi$ production dataset from HERA, covering a large kinematic range in the photon virtuality $Q^2$, the squared momentum transfer $t$, and the photon-proton center-of-mass energy $W$, has been analyzed using various theoretical models with different approaches. In common model analyses, the inherent assumptions and limited kinematic applicability somewhat restrict the predictive power of the models, resulting in model-dependent prediction results. In this paper, we present our model-independent approach for the same reaction process and dataset, utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The prediction of the best ANN model for the HERA differential cross-section dataset over a range of $W$, $Q^2$, and $t$ is obtained. We then extend the ANN model by combining the HERA and LHC data at various values of $W$ to predict the total photoproduction cross-section and demonstrate how to extract the exponential slope $b$. We find that the exponential slope $b$ strongly depends on $Q^2$ and $W$.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Renormalization of Dim-8 SMEFT from Complete Amplitude Basis: I. Four-Fermion Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complete one-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) for all the four-fermion operators at dimension-8 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We adopt the on-shell framework, where the RGEs are obtained from the unitarity cuts of the bubble integrals. To construct a consistent set of RGEs without redundancy, we utilize the Young Tensor amplitude/operator basis as the building blocks of the tree-level amplitudes that constitute the unitarity cuts, which incorporates the full flavor structures of the effective operators. Due to the large number of effective operators for a dimension-8 type, it is crucial to reduce the integrated cuts to the same RGE amplitude basis, which is also made possible by the algorithm in the Young Tensor method. With the Mathematica package ABC4EFT that implements the method, we obtain the full result of the dimension-8 four-fermion RGEs with the output file attached as the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Absence of CP Violation in the Scalar Sector of a Higgs Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for spontaneous CP violation in a Higgs Triplet Model extension, including a complex singlet scalar. We demonstrate that the scalar potential strictly forbids spontaneous CP violation across the entire parameter space. For a non-zero trilinear coupling $\kappa$, minimization conditions combined with global symmetries enforce a phase alignment that yields a real vacuum. In the singular limit $\kappa \to 0$, we show that the enhancement of global symmetries renders unphysical vacuum phases. Consequently, we conclude that the scalar sector of this model cannot source CP violation.</description>

      <title>Radiative $H^+_{1,2}W^- Z$ vertices in flavour conserving three Higgs-doublet scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed calculation of the radiatively induced $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices is carried out in the context of flavour conserving three Higgs doublet models (3HDMs). The Type-II, lepton specific and democratic versions of the 3HDM are chosen as representative cases and the \emph{alignment limit} is adopted. We arrange the amplitudes in UV-finite and gauge-invariant subsets for a sharper understanding of the underlying one-loop structure. Factoring-in various theoretical constraints and the ones from the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ signal strength and the $B \to X_s \gamma$ branching ratio, we compute the relevant form factors and compare them among the various 3HDM types taken. The results also indicate a sizeable increment ($\sim 100\%$) over the corresponding form factors in 2HDMs. In addition, we probe the $H_{1,2}^+ W^- Z$ vertices at the 14 TeV LHC using vector boson fusion (VBF). It is seen that production of $H_1^+$ via VBF and the subsequent $H_1^+ \to H_2^+ H_2/A_2$ decays can have $\sigma \times \text{BR}$ in the $\mathcal{O}$(0.1 fb) ball park. Therefore, such a cascade can shed light on the strength of the $H_1^+ W^- Z$ interaction and confirm the presence of two charged scalars thereby acting as a smoking gun signal of a 3HDM.</description>

      <title>Direct Deep Neural-network Extraction of Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning method for the nonparametric extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from Compton form factors (CFFs) constrained by experimental data. The method addresses the longstanding inverse problem posed by the principal-value (PV) linear integral transform with a singular kernel that relates the charge-conjugation-even (C-even) quark GPD $H^{(+)}$ to the real part of the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) amplitude. Our approach constructs a differentiable representation of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) PV kernel and embeds it as a fixed, physics-preserving layer inside a neural network that parameterizes the GPD $H^{(+)}(x,\xi,t,Q^{2})$ itself. The model enforces exact oddness in $x$, implements endpoint suppression, and includes curvature-based regularization that stabilizes the inversion in kinematically ill-conditioned regions. A Monte Carlo ensemble of CFFs, obtained from a global neural-network fit to unpolarized DVCS measurements with propagated experimental uncertainties, serves as input to a replica ensemble of GPD networks, yielding a fully probabilistic extraction of $H^{(+)}$ over the phase space. We demonstrate the method using a global determination of $\mathrm{Re}\,\mathcal{H}$ for Jefferson Lab measurements, and present a direct neural-network reconstruction of three-dimensional GPD surfaces $H^{(+)}(x_{0},\xi,t,Q_{0}^{2})$ obtained from experimental CFF inputs. This work establishes a flexible, scalable, and model-independent strategy for extracting multidimensional hadronic structure from current and future DVCS data and other GPD-related processes.</description>

      <title>Regge theory in hadron physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to Regge theory as it pertains to the study of hadrons and their interactions. We clarify the fundamental concepts of analyticity in the complex angular momentum plane and their implications for scattering amplitudes. We highlight historical developments that significantly shaped our understanding of scattering theory and the strong interaction, both before and following the discovery of QCD. We end with a review of more recent applications of Regge theory in QCD phenomenology, including describing exchange processes, constraining low-energy amplitudes, and analyzing resonances in the complex angular momentum plane.</description>

      <title>Mass Spectra of $\Lambda_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$ Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration indicate that no $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ bound-state with a mass near threshold in the range $4715$--$4735~\mathrm{MeV}$ was observed. In order to determine the plausible mass region of the bound states in this structure, we calculate the mass spectrum of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ molecular configuration with the method of QCD sum rules. Two linearly independent interpolating currents are constructed, and contributions from nonperturbative condensates up to dimension 12 are included in the numerical results. Consequently, we obtain the masses of the candidate bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$. Our results show that the central values of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Sigma}_c$ bound-state masses lie around the $5.8~\mathrm{GeV}$ region, consistent with the findings reported by the BESIII Collaboration. Furthermore, we compute the mass spectrum of the $\Lambda_b\bar{\Sigma}_b$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-,\,0^+,\,1^-,\,1^+$, which could be served as hidden-bottom candidates in the experimental detecting.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Textures from Modular $A_4$ Left--Right Symmetry: Experimental Signatures at DUNE and T2HK in the Post-JUNO Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have realized different two-zero textures within the framework of the left right symmetric model using the $\Gamma_{3}\cong A_{4}$ modular group. The matter multiplets of the model are assigned as three singlet representations of the $A_{4}$ group, and their charge assignments together with the modular weights of the Yukawa couplings are chosen in such a way that different two-zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix are obtained. In total, we have successfully realized seven different two-zero textures. Furthermore, we have studied neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes, and have calculated the effective Majorana mass and the branching ratios for LFV processes for each of the textures. We further probe these two-zero textures at the long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and T2HK. We find that DUNE, especially when combined with T2HK, can significantly restrict the $\theta_{23}-\delta_{\rm CP}$ parameter space predicted by these textures. Moreover, the inclusion of high-precision determinations of $\theta_{12}$ (from JUNO) and $\theta_{13}$ leads to a substantial, further reduction of the allowed parameter space. For assumed inverted mass ordering, the synergy of DUNE and T2HK leads to a highly predictive scenario for the $B_{2}$ and $B_{4}$ textures, as the allowed regions collapse into tiny islands near the CP-conserving points in the lower and higher octant of $\theta_{23}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions of QCD in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of low-energy QCD matter in strong magenetic fields is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), a periodic array of neutral pion domain walls (chiral solitons) perpendicular to the magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion phase, in which Skyrmions are induced on top of the CSL. Previously found domain-wall Skyrmions are bosons with the baryon number two. In this paper, we show that the minimum domain-wall Skyrmions are fermions with the baryon number one; a bosonic domain-wall Skyrmion can be separated without cost of energy into two fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions attached on the opposite sides of a chiral soliton. The phase boundary between the CSL and domain-wall Skyrmion phases is unchanged. In the chiral limit, the CSL reduces to a linearly dependent neutral pion on the direction of the magnetic field, while fermionic domain-wall Skyrmions sit in an equal distance of a half period.</description>

      <title>Signature for charged Higgs pair production in 2HDM+a model at CLIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the search for charged Higgs bosons in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model plus an additional pseudo-scalar (2HDM+a) at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). Focusing on the pair production of charged Higgs bosons, followed by the decays $H^\pm \to a W $ and $ H^\mp \to t b $, we analyze the signal channel of $4j+2b+E_T^{miss}$. Given the center-of-mass energy of CLIC as $ \sqrt{s} = 1500$ GeV, charged Higgs bosons with masses $ m_{H^\pm} &lt; \sqrt{s}/2$ are explored. Simulation results indicate that the signal significance of 400 GeV and 600 GeV charged Higgs bosons can reach $5\sigma$ in specific parameter spaces, and the $2\sigma$ exclusion limits in the $m_{H^\pm}- m_a$ plane are presented for $m_{H^\pm}$ in the range of [400, 650] GeV.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the fully charm tetraquark states, particularly incorporating contributions from internal gluon radiations. The paper first presents analytical expressions for the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to the decay amplitudes of fully charm tetraquarks into two photons. It is found that the QCD corrections are significant for the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process, whereas they are relatively small for the $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ fully charm tetraquark decay process. Subsequently, by considering photon-photon fusion in ultra-peripheral high-energy collisions of protons and nuclei and in electron-positron collision processes, we provide theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of fully-charm tetraquark states. The results presented in this work regarding the electromagnetic production and decay of fully charm tetraquarks shall be tested in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards precise baryogenesis in the 2HDM$+a$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of the viable baryogenesis parameter space of a non-minimal Higgs sector consisting of two Higgs doublets and a singlet pseudoscalar (2HDM$+a$). In such a model, an early Universe period of transient CP violation may occur, driven by a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the CP-odd scalar $a$. This naturally avoids the stringent electric dipole moment experimental constraints on beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of CP violation. We provide a state-of-art computation of the baryon asymmetry, providing several important improvements over existing baryogenesis computations for this model. We show that the required thermal history and successful baryogenesis lead to a predictive scenario, testable in the near future by a combination of LHC searches and low-energy flavour measurements. Our improved predictions for the baryon asymmetry find that it is rather suppressed compared to earlier predictions, requiring larger mixing between the singlet and 2HDM pseudoscalars and hence leading to a more easily testable model at colliders.</description>

      <title>Gauge Coupling Unification in Gauge-Higgs GUT: Theory and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise survey of the running of gauge couplings in realistic models of gauge-Higgs grand unification in a slice of AdS$_5$ space and investigate their potential unification. Besides unifying the gauge groups of the Standard Model, these models can address various unresolved puzzles, such as the lightness of the Higgs boson and the strong hierarchies within fermion masses and mixings, as well as provide a common origin of the gauge symmetries and the sector that spontaneously breaks them. At the same time, they furnish interesting LHC signatures in the form of TeV-scale resonances of the $X,Y$-like bosons, providing a trace of the grand-unified group, accessible at low energies. Using the method of Planck-brane correlators allows us to evolve the couplings consistently from the electroweak scale up to the Planck scale, avoiding shortcomings of other frequently-used approaches and including the effects of bulk scalars, fermions, and gauge-bosons within a common framework. We thereby revisit, contrast, and supplement results in the literature, the latter for example by including brane masses and the gauge-Higgs vacuum expectation value. Moreover, in a phenomenology section, we apply our results to the concrete case of Georgi-Glashow-like unification with a SU(6) $\supset$ SU(5) symmetry in the 5D bulk, presenting a quantitative survey of the quality of unification. We find that grand unification is possible in such models in the presence of moderately large brane kinetic terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore models where single new exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric Standard Model portal with couplings to at least one gluon and one lepton. We consider the complete set of effective operators up to dimension 6, and examine a few additional dimension 7 operators that contain interesting field content or potential collider signals. The lepton-gluon portal allows access to exotic states with an interesting range of SU(3) and SU(2) quantum numbers. Finally, we explore potential single-production modes and their phenomenological signatures at colliders.</description>

      <title>Dark Higgs in Hidden Sector as a Probe for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a sensitivity analysis of exotic Higgs boson decays at the electron--positron stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee), performed within the FCCAnalyses framework. The analysis investigates Higgs boson production in association with a Z boson in electron--positron collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 240~GeV. The Higgs boson is assumed to decay into a pair of long-lived scalar particles, while the Z boson decays leptonically. A hadronic final state is considered, in which the long-lived scalars subsequently decay into bottom--antibottom quark pairs.
  The simulation chain is implemented using the FCCAnalyses framework, with event generation performed using \textsc{MadGraph} and \textsc{Pythia}, and detector effects modeled with \textsc{Delphes}. Displaced vertices arising from the decays of long-lived particles are reconstructed using the FCCAnalyses implementation of the \textsc{LCFIPlus} secondary vertex finding algorithm, enhanced with extended features such as customized track selection.
  The final event selection requires the reconstruction of a Z boson together with at least two displaced vertices. This strategy efficiently suppresses Standard Model backgrounds while retaining at least three expected signal events, including statistical uncertainties, over most of the explored parameter space. The study considers scalar masses of 20~GeV and 60~GeV and mixing angles of $10^{-5}$, $10^{-6}$, and $10^{-7}$. The results demonstrate that FCC-ee will be sensitive to long-lived scalars with decay lengths ranging from approximately 1~mm to 10~m, with optimal sensitivity around a decay length of 0.3~m.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Bound on Neutrino Energy Reconstruction from Nuclear Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino energy reconstruction on nuclear targets underlies oscillation measurements and precision tests of weak interactions. Inclusive charged--current data have long exhibited degeneracies commonly attributed to axial-mass tuning, multinucleon dynamics, and final-state interactions. This work shows that, even in the idealized limit of perfect detectors and exact nuclear dynamics, inclusive lepton-only reconstruction admits no unique inverse. A strictly positive lower bound on neutrino energy resolution follows from the finite energy-transfer support of the inclusive nuclear axial response. The result identifies an irreducible contribution to reconstruction uncertainty that is independent of modeling assumptions and experimental resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate inflation models governed by the Siegel modular group $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$. The $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ group extends the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ framework from one modulus to three moduli while preserving the hyperbolic geometry of the K\"ahler potential, allowing for the construction of cosmological $\alpha$-attractor models. In this context, we use genus $g=2$ absolute invariants to construct inflationary potentials within specific subspaces of the Siegel moduli space. These models are driven by the imaginary components of the moduli $\tau$ and naturally yield plateau-like potentials consistent with Planck 2018 observations in large field limit. We employ two-dimensional complex subspaces to realize E-model and T-model like two-field inflation scenarios. We explore the subspace of complex dimension one to construct a modified polynomial $\alpha$-attractor model, which can accommodate the larger spectral index $n_s$ favored by recent ACT and SPT data, particularly in the larger $N$ regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Implications of Cosmic Birefringence for Multi-Field ALP Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence, characterized by the observed rotation of the polarization plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, serves as a critical probe for testing theories beyond the standard cosmological scenario. As a major component of the universe, dark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmic evolution, particularly in the formation of large-scale structures. However, its fundamental nature remains elusive. Axion-like particles (ALPs), as promising dark matter candidates, possess unique advantages in naturally explaining such phenomena. Previous studies on the implications of cosmic birefringence for these ultralight ALP fields have focused on single-field models with conventional potentials. These models face exclusion due to the washout effect - a suppression of the CMB polarization power spectrum induced by oscillatory dynamics of the scalar field within the mass range of less than $10^{-23}$ eV. To address this limitation, we develop a more general theoretical framework incorporating two ALP fields, providing analytical approximations and numerical calculations. Our findings reveal that the superposition of two ALP fields with distinct masses can relax the constraints imposed by the washout effect and reconcile with observations.</description>

      <title>A Rare Millisecond Pulsar with Cross-Pole Emission: Single-Pulse Insights from PSR J1857+0943</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of subpulse variability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) offer important constraints on their emission physics. Using the high sensitivity of FAST, we present the first identification of distinct single pulse fluctuation behaviour in PSR J1857+0943. We find that the third component(MP\_C3) of the main pulse may originate from a different region than the other two main-pulse components and may instead share a common origin with the interpulse. This conclusion is supported by four observational evidence as follows: First, the LRCCF shows a clear anticorrelation between MP\_C3 and the interpulse. Second, the single-pulse polarization at the main-pulse longitude reveals obvious component mixing. Third, the modulation period of the interpulse components is roughly twice that of MP\_C3. Fourth, the reduced modulation index in MP\_C3 suggests possible mixing of emission from different regions. The interpretation in this letter contrasts with the usual assumption that the main pulse and interpulse originate from opposite magnetic poles. Hence, PSR J1857+0943 provides a rare laboratory for probing component-dependent plasma behaviour in an MSP magnetosphere. Our results offer direct evidence that the main pulse can include emission associated with more than one magnetic pole and highlight the importance of single-pulse diagnostics for understanding the geometry and dynamics of pulsars with interpulse emission. In addition, we analyse the jitter properties of this pulsar and measure a one-hour jitter of $\sigma_{J,1\rm h} = 78 \pm 3~\mathrm{ns}$ at 1.25 GHz, consistent with previous studies.</description>

Abstract: Signatures of massive particles during inflation are highly informative targets for cosmological experiments. With recent progress on both theoretical and observational frontiers, we have reached the point where these novel signals of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) can be systematically tested with increasingly precise data. In this paper, we present the results of improved CMB data analysis for cosmological collider signals using Planck CMB data. To set the stage, we first construct a set of simplified but characteristic collider templates which are accurate over a broad range of particle masses, spins and sound speeds. In order to break degeneracies with single-field PNG, we propose an orthogonalization scheme such that the collider templates are uncorrelated with the highly constrained equilateral and orthogonal shapes. On this basis, we deploy the Modal bispectrum estimator for the Planck analysis and perform a systematic scan of parameters to search for the most significant collider signal. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio is found to be $2.35\sigma$ for massive spin-0 exchange after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. In addition, we cross-validate the Modal analysis with the CMB-BEST pipeline, which demonstrates the consistency of results across the benchmark examples of collider templates. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio regime we find at the current stage of PNG observations, we believe the orthogonalization procedure provides an optimized strategy for future tests of the cosmological collider with the ability to rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian soft radiation data for a celestial theory</title>

Abstract: Celestial holography posits that the long-distance behavior of gauge and gravity theories is dictated by two-dimensional conformal field theories defined on the celestial sphere. For non-abelian gauge theories, this proposal is verified, to all perturbative orders, by dipole color correlations in the infrared factor of non-abelian scattering amplitudes, which are given by a correlator of matrix-valued vertex operators in a free-boson theory on the sphere. Decades of high-order gauge-theory calculations have provided a number of further results that can be used to test and constrain a possible celestial theory: they include explicit expressions for soft emission currents up to three particles, and up to three loops for single soft emission. In this paper, we analyze this trove of data, appropriately translated in the celestial language, and we use them to extract information on the celestial theory. In particular, we show that all logarithms arising in the loop expansion of the single soft current can be reabsorbed in the scale choices for the $d$-dimensional coupling, casting some doubt on the need for a logarithmic celestial theory. We then note that the celestial OPEs suggested by the structure of multiple emission currents in collinear limits are never ambiguous, but involve coefficients depending on gluon energy fractions, which break holomorphic factorization, as well as associativity when double limits are taken. Strongly-ordered soft limits recover associativity, but suffer from ambiguities already discussed in earlier literature.</description>

      <title>Does the Electron EDM Preclude Electroweak Baryogenesis ?</title>

Abstract: Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) constitutes a theoretically compelling and experimentally testable mechanism for explaining the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). New results for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron place significant constraints on the beyond Standard Model CP-violation needed for successful EWBG. Using a specific model illustration, we show how new developments in EWBG quantum transport theory that include CP-violating sources first order in gradients imply more relaxed EDM constraints -- and thereby greater EWBG viability -- than implied by previous approximation formulations. We also illustrate how these developments enable a more realistic treatment of CP-conserving interactions that can also have a decisive impact on the predicted BAU.</description>

      <title>PDFxTMDLib: A High-Performance C++ Library for Collinear and Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collinear parton distribution functions (cPDFs) and transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) are essential for calculating cross sections in high-energy physics, particularly within collinear and kt-factorization frameworks. Currently, there exists two libraries, such as LHAPDF and TMDLib, to obtain these physical objects. However, there are limitations in both libraries, especially for TMDs, such as restricted customization and extensibility. Users are limited to the implementations provided by these libraries and cannot easily support unconventional PDFs. Moreover, no standard TMD library currently provides a consistent framework for QCD coupling evaluation or for studying uncertainties at the distribution level--features that are important for diagnostic and comparative analyses in phenomenological research.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce PDFxTMDLib, a modern C++ library designed to offer a robust and flexible solution. This library supports both collinear PDFs and TMDs while allowing greater customization. It also opens the way to support higher-order distributions. In this article, we describe the structure of PDFxTMDLib. We also demonstrate its validity and performance by integrating it into the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator to compute Drell-Yan cross sections. Additionally, comparisons of PDFs obtained from PDFxTMDLib with those from LHAPDF and TMDLib confirm the reliability of PDFxTMDLib's results.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photon-fusion production of even-spin resonances and exotic QED atoms in high-energy hadron collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross sections for the single exclusive production of (pseudo)scalar and (pseudo)tensor hadrons, as well as of even-spin QED bound states formed by pairs of opposite-charge leptons or hadrons, are estimated for photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus at the RHIC, LHC and FCC colliders, as well as in proton-air interactions at the highest energies reached by cosmic-rays impinging on Earth. The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onium, and B-onium) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) over $m_{\gamma\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC.</description>

      <title>High-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry from the interplay of vertical and horizontal gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a class of axion models where an accidental $\mathrm{U}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry automatically emerges from the interplay of vertical (grand-unified) and horizontal (flavor) gauge symmetries. We study a specific Pati-Salam realization in detail, and aim to generalize the conclusions. We show that our specific model offers protection from PQ-violating operators to high dimension, and demonstrate that the model can reproduce the Standard Model flavor structure. A distinctive feature of the vertical-horizontal setup is the presence of parametrically light fermions, known as anomalons, which are introduced to cancel the gauge anomalies of the flavor symmetry. We also identify a major challenge to building a fully realistic model, most notably that of Landau poles in gauge couplings before the Planck scale. For the specific model investigated, the pre-inflationary PQ-breaking scenario predicts the axion mass window to be $m_a \in [2 \times 10^{-8}, 10^{-3}]\,\mathrm{eV}$. Conversely, a high-quality axion may be obtained instead in the post-inflationary scenario, with axion mass $m_a \gtrsim 0.01\,\mathrm{eV}$, and anomalon masses predicted below the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale. We elaborate on anomalons' cosmological production in the early universe, highlighting how measurements of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ could serve as a low-energy probe of the ultraviolet dynamics addressing the PQ quality problem.</description>

Abstract: We propose utilizing space quantum sensors to detect ultralight dark matter (ULDM) bound to planetary bodies, focusing on Jupiter as the heaviest planet in the solar system. Leveraging Jupiter's deep gravitational potential and the wealth of experience from numerous successful missions, we present strong sensitivity projections on the mass and couplings of scalar ULDM. Future space missions offer unique opportunities to probe the ULDM interactions using quantum sensors, including superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers. By measuring dark matter-induced magnetic field oscillations, we expect to achieve sensitivity orders of magnitude beyond the terrestrial probes and significantly improve detection prospects of theoretically motivated ULDM candidates.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, with the increasing luminosities of colliders, handling the growing amount of data has become a major challenge for future new physics~(NP) phenomenological research. To improve efficiency, machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of high-energy physics. As a machine learning algorithm, the local outlier factor~(LOF), and the nested LOF~(NLOF) are potential tools for NP phenomenological studies. In this work, the possibility of searching for the signals of anomalous quartic gauge couplings~(aQGCs) at muon colliders using the NLOF is investigated. Taking the process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma\gamma$ as an example, the signals of dimension-8 aQGCs are studied, expected coefficient constraints are presented. The event selection strategy uses unsupervised anomaly scores, with supervised optimization for EFT sensitivity. The NLOF algorithm is shown to outperform the k-means based anomaly detection methods, and a traditional counterpart.</description>

      <title>New Types of Hydrogenlike matter Composed of Electron(s) and Meson(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we predict the existence of new types of hydrogenlike matter, including hydrogenlike atoms ($\pi^+e^-$, $K^+e^-$, $D^+e^-$), hydrogenlike molecular ions ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-$) and hydrogenlike molecules ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-e^-$). By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the binding energy of hydrogenlike atoms is obtained as $E_n=-\frac{1}{2n^2}$. For hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, the variational method is employed to calculate the binding energies, i.e., $E_+=-0.587$ and $E_0=-1.139$ for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, respectively. And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic units for convenience. In addition, the strong interaction between the two constituent mesons is considered in our calculations, where we find that its influence on the hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules can be neglected. Comparisons of hydrogenlike molecular ion and molecule with the systems governed by the strong interaction are made, which suggests the possible existence of doubly heavy triquark, hidden heavy-flavor tetraquarks and doubly heavy tetraquarks. Hopefully, these types of matter would be observed in the future with the improvement of accuracy in the high energy physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry and odd weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the framework of non-holomorphic modular flavor symmetry to include the odd weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms. The integer weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms of level $N$ can be arranged into multipltets of the homogeneous finite modular group $\Gamma'_N$. We propose to construct the integer weight, including weight one, non-holomorphic polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms from the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. The previous results of even weight polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms are reproduced. We apply this formalism to address the flavor structure of the standard model. An example lepton model based on the modular group $\Gamma'_3\cong T'$ is constructed, where neutrino masses are generated via type-I seesaw mechanism with two right-handed neutrinos. This model can accommodate the experimental data for both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. We further extend this model to include quarks, so that the masses and mixing parameters of both quark and lepton sectors can be successfully described in terms of only thirteen real free parameters. It is the modular invariant model with the smallest number of free parameters so far, only normal ordering neutrino mass is viable after including quarks, and the correlations among the input parameters and flavor observables are analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of future high-energy muon colliders to neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) through the process $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\to\gamma\nu\bar{\nu}$ within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Extending beyond previous studies, we consider a set of 14 dimension-8 operators, including both Higgs-related and pure gauge structures. By computing the cross sections and performing Monte Carlo simulations at multiple center-of-mass energies (3-30 TeV), we demonstrate that the annihilation process dominates over vector boson fusion (VBF) at TeV scales. We also explore the impact of beam polarization and show that the $(-+)$ polarization enhances sensitivity to several operators. After the study of the event selection strategies, we show that muon colliders can impose stronger expected constraints on nTGCs operators than current LHC bounds, with two of the pure gauge operators yielding the most stringent expected constraints. We also evaluate the contribution of CP-violating pure gauge operators to the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), finding that the expected constraints from muon colliders are stronger than those from EDM measurements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Pion Electromagnetic Form Factor with Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NNLO QCD corrections for the pion electromagnetic form factor at large momentum transfer have been recently performed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 201901 (2024); Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 221901 (2025)], revealing that the NLO and NNLO contributions are positive and sizeable. Unfortunately, these predictions have been obtained using the conventional scale-setting method and thus they are plagued by large renormalization scale ambiguities. In this paper, we analyze the pion electromagnetic form factor at NNLO by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which is introduced with the aim of resolving renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. By applying the PMC, a more precise perturbative QCD (pQCD) prediction for the pion EMFF \(Q^2F_\pi(Q^2)\) without conventional renormalization scale ambiguity can be achieved. This improved pQCD prediction is highly beneficial for the precise determination of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude. We then conduct a comprehensive comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the pion EMFF \(Q^2F_\pi(Q^2)\).</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis with Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Waves from First-order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Potential of di-Higgs observation via a calibratable jet-free $HH\to 4b$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calibratable, jet-free framework that enhances the search significance of the flagship LHC channel $HH \to 4b$ by more than a factor of five compared to existing approaches. The method employs a mass-decorrelated discriminant to identify $h_1 h_2 \to 4b$ with variable $h_{1,2}$ masses and a simultaneous estimator of $(m_{h_1}, m_{h_2})$, both derived from multiclass classification on all-particle inputs. The $HH$ signal response can be calibrated using $ZZ \to 4b$. Using a highly realistic simulation framework validated through multiple tests, we demonstrate the method's robustness and identify two prerequisites essential for achieving this level of sensitivity. Results indicate that with LHC Run 2 and 3 data, observation-level sensitivity to $HH$ appears within reach, enabling constraints on $\kappa_\lambda$ comparable to HL-LHC projections and offering an accelerated path to precision measurements of the Higgs trilinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Blast-wave-Tsallis-power model for $p_{\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic flow $v_2$ of hadrons in collisions of identical nuclei at energies available at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the phenomenological blast-wave-Tsallis-power model, recently proposed by the author for the hadrons transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra measured at the LHC, is developed to also describe the hadrons $p_\textrm{T}$-differential elliptic flow coefficients $v_2$ in identical nuclei collisions of different centralities. The model describes well the available data on $p_\textrm{T}$-spectra and $v_2$ for any $p_\textrm{T}$ of various particles, from pions to charmonia, in Pb--Pb at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02~TeV, and in Xe--Xe at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.44~TeV. Also, predictions for OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.36~TeV are given. While the model is mainly targeting the LHC energies, it also works at much lower RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>Reviving the energy-dependent partonic structure of $f_0(980)$ via two-pion distribution amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model-independent framework for analyzing four-body semileptonic decays, performing the first high-twist analysis of the $D_s \to \left[ \pi\pi \right]_{\rm S}$ form factors using isoscalar two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes($2\pi$DAs). It is motivated by persistent tensions between phenomenological cascade analyses and QCD-based interpretations of the partonic structure of $f_0$ meson. Our study reveals that the twist-3 $2\pi$DAs incorporate an asymmetry in the partial-wave expansion, a feature absent in single $f_0$ distribution amplitudes, that drives a substantial cancellation between twist-2 and twist-3 contributions to the form factors. As a result, the predicted decay rate falls significantly below the experimental value. These findings indicate that the isoscalar two-pion system near the charm scale is not primarily a $q{\bar q}$ state, reviving the energy-dependent partonic structures of light scalar mesons by highlighting a fundamental limitation of the single-meson LCDA approach in describing such complex systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Meson-antimeson mixing</title>

Abstract: Meson-antimeson transitions are flavor-changing neutral current processes in which the strangeness, charm, or beauty quantum number changes by two units. In the Standard Model (SM) these transitions originate from box diagrams with two W bosons. They permit the preparation of time-dependent, oscillating quantum states which are superpositions of a meson and its antimeson. By studying their decays one gains information on both the meson-antimeson mixing amplitude and the decay amplitude involved and one can measure complex phases quantifying the violation of charge-parity (CP) violation. I present a comprehensive overview on the topic, starting with phenomenological presentations of $K$-$\bar K$, $B_d$-$\bar B_d$, $B_s$-$\bar B_s$, and $D$-$\bar D$ mixing. Highlights are the discovery of the violation of CP and other discrete symmetries, the predictions of the charm quark and its mass and a heavy top quark, and the confirmation of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism of CP violation. Further sections cover the theoretical formalism needed to describe meson-antimeson mixing and to calculate observables in terms of the fundamental parameters of the SM. I discuss the unitarity triangle of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which is used to visualize how various CP-violating and CP-conserving quantities combine to probe the SM. I describe the emergence of precision flavor physics and the role of reliable theory calculations to link $K$-$\bar K$ mixing to $B_d$-$\bar B_d$ mixing, which was essential to confirm the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism, and present the current status of theory predictions. Today, the focus of the field is on physics beyond the SM, because meson-antimeson mixing amplitudes are sensitive to virtual effects of heavy particles with masses which are several orders of magnitude above the reach of current particle colliders.</description>

      <title>A formalism for constructing the QCD power spectrum with finite sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of QCD phenomena with energy correlators motivates novel approaches to explore the information contained in the QCD radiation spectrum. Fox-Wolfram moments are a set of observables that characterize the angular distribution of energy flow in high-energy collisions. Contrary to their conventional application, they are a class of correlated moments that cannot be reduced to one or several characteristic ones. We present a formalism to extract their fully correlated information content, while systematically discarding small-angle sampling noise, on an event-by-event basis. We show that our approach circumvents a common misspecification of the data in terms of $\delta$-distributions, and is essential in keeping the power spectrum infrared and collinear safe. Our formalism introduces a means of accounting for the varying spatial extent of objects that enter the calculation of the power spectrum, with which experimental artifacts such as detector element geometries and measurement uncertainties can readily be incorporated.</description>

      <title>Real-time propagators resummed with nontrivial boundary wavefunctions in a constant electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the derivation of an alternative representation of the real-time in-in formalism under a spatially homogeneous and time independent electric field. Because the system exhibits instability associated with pair production of particles and antiparticles, the perturbation theory should be reorganized depending on the choice of the reference vacuum. We recast the boundary wavefunctions into the quadratic self-energy-like terms in the functional integration formalism. The resulting generating functional in the modified in-in formalism leads to the propagators that resum infinite diagrams necessary to capture the vacuum-instability effects. The proper-time representations of the propagators reproduce the known expressions from the canonical operator formalism, but our derivation based on the generating functional along the closed-time path clarifies the origin of the additional proper-time contour and provides a better physical understanding. Finally, as a concrete example of the application, we compute the in-in expectation value of the vector current in a constant electric field, and find that the simple one-loop calculation captures the pair production effect.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in the Carrollian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>Redshift-space distortion constraints on the neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the redshift-space distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with nonzero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Bound and Resonant States of Muonic Few-Body Coulomb Systems: Extended Stochastic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the bound and resonant states of hydrogen-like muonic ions ($\mu\mu p$, $\mu\mu d$, $\mu\mu t$) and three-body muonic molecular ions ($pp\mu$, $pd\mu$, $pt\mu$, $dd\mu$, $dt\mu$, $tt\mu$), and the four-body double-muonic hydrogen molecule ($\mu\mu pp$) using an extended stochastic variational method combined with complex scaling. The approach provides a unified treatment of bound and quasibound states and achieves an energy accuracy better than $0.1~\mathrm{eV}$ across all systems studied. Complete spectra below the corresponding $n=2$ atomic thresholds are obtained, including several previously unresolved shallow resonances in both three- and four-body sectors.</description>
