      <title>Flatbands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flatbands in anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians with an $E=0$ flatband by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flatbands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered $E=0$ flatbands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flatband eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flatband eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>The random free field scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.</description>

      <title>Immortal quantum correlation in quasiperiodic quasi-1D system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing view on long-range correlations is that they typically attenuate uniformly with distance and temperature, as most interactions either exhibit short-range dominance or decay following a power law. In contrast to this belief, this study demonstrates that the intricate interplay between quasiperiodicity and the quasi-1D nature of subbands can result in strong long-range coupling without attenuation, a phenomenon referred to as an immortal interaction. Exemplifying a periodically stacked Fibonacci chain, we uncover an immortal interaction with greatly enhanced, persistent long-range coupling. Using negativity, it is shown that this interaction creates stable entanglement that endures over long distances and remains robust at finite temperatures. Additionally, unconventional logarithmic scaling entanglement is revealed, deviating from the traditional area law. These findings offer quasiperiodic quasi-1D systems as a novel platform for sustaining stable entanglement across exceptionally long distances, even in the presence of finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Mapping self-avoiding walk on obstacle-ridden lattice onto chelation of heavy metal ions: Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-avoiding walk (SAW) represents linear polymer chain on a large scale, neglecting its chemical details and emphasizing the role of its conformational statistics. The role of the latter is important in formation of agglomerates and complexes involving polymers and organic or inorganic particles, such as polymer-stabilized colloidal suspensions, microemulsions, or micellar solutions. When such particles can be adsorbed on a polymer of considerably larger dimensions than themselves, this setup may represent chelation of heavy metal ions by polymeric chelants. We consider the SAW of the length $N$ on a cubic lattice ridden by randomly distributed obstacles of the concentration $p$ interpreted as ions. The SAW monomers can bind to the obstacles with variable binding energy $\varepsilon$ mimicking formation of the chelation bond. Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is applied to simulate system behaviour. We focus on several relevant properties related to the chelation efficiency and strength, as functions of the variables set $\{p,N,\varepsilon\}$. The results are interpreted in terms of conformational freedom, excluded volume effects and loop formation for the SAW, and the tendencies being predicted are in agreement with some experimental data.</description>

      <title>Higher-order interactions in random Lotka-Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use generating functionals to derive a dynamic mean-field description for generalised Lotka-Volterra systems with higher-order quenched random interactions. We use the resulting single effective species process to determine the stability diagram in the space of parameters specifying the statistics of interactions, and to calculate the properties of the surviving community in the stable phase. We find that the behaviour as a function of the model parameters is often similar to the pairwise model. For example, the presence of more exploitative interactions increases stability. However we also find differences. For instance, we confirm in more general settings an observation made previously in model with third-order interactions that more competition between species can increase linear stability, and the diversity in the community, an effect not seen in the pairwise model. The phase diagram of the model with higher-order interactions is more complex than that of the model with pairwise interactions. We identify a new mathematical condition for a sudden onset of diverging abundances.</description>

      <title>Fast Analysis of the OpenAI O1-Preview Model in Solving Random K-SAT Problem: Does the LLM Solve the Problem Itself or Call an External SAT Solver?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript I present an analysis on the performance of OpenAI O1-preview model in solving random K-SAT instances for K$\in {2,3,4}$ as a function of $\alpha=M/N$ where $M$ is the number of clauses and $N$ is the number of variables of the satisfiable problem. I show that the model can call an external SAT solver to solve the instances, rather than solving them directly. Despite using external solvers, the model reports incorrect assignments as output. Moreover, I propose and present an analysis to quantify whether the OpenAI O1-preview model demonstrates a spark of intelligence or merely makes random guesses when outputting an assignment for a Boolean satisfiability problem.</description>

      <title>Faster algorithms for the alignment of sparse correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph ensemble is a probability law on pairs of graphs with $n$ vertices, parametrized by their average degree $\lambda$ and their correlation coefficient $s$. It can be used as a benchmark for the graph alignment problem, in which the labels of the vertices of one of the graphs are reshuffled by an unknown permutation; the goal is to infer this permutation and thus properly match the pairs of vertices in both graphs. A series of recent works has unveiled the role of Otter's constant $\alpha$ (that controls the exponential rate of growth of the number of unlabeled rooted trees as a function of their sizes) in this problem: for $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ and $\lambda$ large enough it is possible to recover in a time polynomial in $n$ a positive fraction of the hidden permutation. The exponent of this polynomial growth is however quite large and depends on the other parameters, which limits the range of applications of the algorithm. In this work we present a family of faster algorithms for this task, show through numerical simulations that their accuracy is only slightly reduced with respect to the original one, and conjecture that they undergo, in the large $\lambda$ limit, phase transitions at modified Otter's thresholds $\sqrt{\widehat{\alpha}}&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}$, with $\widehat{\alpha}$ related to the enumeration of a restricted family of trees.</description>

      <title>Infection fronts in randomly varying transmission-rate media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the geometry and transport properties of infection fronts within the spatial SIR model in two dimensions. The model incorporates short-range correlated quenched random transmission rates. Our findings reveal that the critical average transmission rate for the steady-state propagation of the infection is overestimated by the naive mean-field homogenization. Furthermore, we observe that the velocity, profile, and harmfulness of the fronts, given a specific average transmission, are sensitive to the details of randomness. In particular, we find that the harmfulness of the front is larger the more uniform the transmission-rate is, suggesting potential optimization in vaccination strategies under constraints like fixed average-transmission-rates or limited vaccine resources. The large-scale geometry of the advancing fronts presents nevertheless robust universal features and, for a statistically isotropic and short-range correlated disorder, we get a roughness exponent $\alpha\approx 0.42 \pm 0.10$ and a dynamical exponent $z\approx 1.6 \pm 0.10$, which are roughly compatible with the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We find that the KPZ term and the disorder-induced effective noise are present and have a kinematic origin.</description>

      <title>Correlating light fields through disordered media across multiple degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speckle patterns are inherent features of coherent light propagation through complex media. As a result of interference, they are sensitive to multiple experimental parameters such as the configuration of disorder or the propagating wavelength. Recent developments in wavefront shaping have made it possible to control speckle pattern statistics and correlations, for example using the concept of the transmission matrix. In this article, we address the problem of correlating scattered fields across multiple degrees of freedom. We highlight the common points between the specific techniques already demonstrated, and we propose a general framework based on the singular value decomposition of a linear combination of multiple transmission matrices. Following analytical predictions, we experimentally illustrate the technique on spectral and temporal correlations, and we show that both the amplitude and the phase of the field correlations can be tuned. Our work opens up new perspectives in speckle correlation manipulation, with potential applications in coherent control.</description>

      <title>Tree networks of real-world data: analysis of efficiency and spatiotemporal scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work computationally investigates an algorithm that was originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that it seeks the most efficient internal representation of the external world, namely a real-world dataset of patterns. The algorithm produces a transition from star graph to regular 1d lattice, passing through irregular scale-invariant trees, under the effect of a single control parameter. The relatively novel information-theoretic tools of the von Neumann entropy and its derivative, the specific heat, together with the recent definition of thermodynamic quantities, such as work and heat, for networks are reviewed and applied to inspect the tree structures produced by the formation protocol. We observe some consistency between the optimal thermodynamic efficiency for networks and the optimal pattern-matching efficiency, defined in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when the former is measured at the meso-resolution scale involved in the phase transition from star graph to scale-invariant network. We adduce the hypothesis of a richer frequency content at the meso-scale of the self-organized network to explain this observation. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the vicinity to the mentioned phase transition if it is faced with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler. A phase portrait of the tree-generating algorithm is provided and multiple phase transitions are identified.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and local distortions in entropy stabilized oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An idealized high entropy oxide is characterized by perfect chemical disorder and perfect positional order. In this work, we investigate the extent to which short-range order (SRO) and local structural distortions impede that idealized scenario. Working in the entropy stabilized $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, we compare a two-component system, (Ti,Zr)O$_2$, with a four-component system, (Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_2$, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Special quasi-random structures are used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations to investigate the local distortions around specific elements revealing significant local distortions that are relatively insensitive to the number of chemical constituents. Using finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the previously experimentally observed SRO and transition temperature for the two-component system. However, the ideal configurational entropy is never reached, so SRO is expected even at synthesis temperatures. On the other hand, the order-disorder transition temperature is dramatically lower and experimentally inaccessible for the four-component system, while the configurational entropy is closer to ideal and less sensitive to temperature. Total scattering measurements and pair distribution function analysis of slow-cooled and quenched samples support this view. In general, we demonstrate that SRO effects in high entropy materials are less prevalent as more components are added in, provided the pairwise interaction strengths remain comparable, while local distortions are less affected by the number of components.</description>
