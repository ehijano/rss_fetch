      <title>A dynamic shim approach for correcting eddy current effects in diffusion-prepared MRI acquisition using a multi-coil AC/DC shim-array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We developed a dynamic B0 shimming approach using a 46-channel AC/DC shim array to correct phase errors caused by eddy currents from diffusion-encoding gradients in diffusion-prepared MRI, enabling high b-value imaging without the SNR loss from the use of magnitude stabilizer. Methods: A 46-channel AC/DC shim array and corresponding amplifier system were built. Spin echo prescans with and without diffusion preparation were then used to rapidly measure eddy current induced phase differences. These phase maps were used as targets in an optimization framework to compute compensatory shim currents for multi-shot 3D diffusion-prepared acquisitions. Results: The proposed method allows flexible use of the AC/DC shim array to correct undesirable eddy current effects in diffusion-prepared MRI. Phantom and in vivo experiments demonstrate whole-brain, cardiac-gated, multi-shot 3D diffusion-prepared imaging without the use of magnitude stabilizers. The approach enables preservation of full SNR while achieving reliable diffusion encoding at b-values up to 2000 s/mm2. Conclusions: This work demonstrates a new strategy for applying an AC/DC shim array to compensate for eddy current induced phase errors in diffusion-prepared MRI. By eliminating the need for magnitude stabilizer, it enables efficient high-quality diffusion imaging with full signal sensitivity retained.</description>

      <title>A Field Free Line 3D Reconstruction Model for Magnetic Particle Imaging for Improved Sensitivity, Resolution, and High Dynamic Range Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based imaging modality that detects superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in vivo, with applications in cancer cell tracking, lymph node mapping, and cell therapy monitoring. We introduce a new 3D image reconstruction framework for MPI data acquired using multi-angle field-free line (FFL) scans, demonstrating improvements in spatial resolution, quantitative accuracy, and high dynamic range performance over conventional sequential reconstruction pipelines. The framework is built by combining a physics-based FFL signal model with tomographic projection operators to form an efficient 3D forward operator, enabling the full dataset to be reconstructed jointly rather than as a series of independent 2D projections. A harmonic-domain compression step is incorporated naturally within this operator formulation, reducing memory overhead by over two orders of magnitude while preserving the structure and fidelity of the model, enabling volumetric reconstructions on standard desktop GPU hardware in only minutes. Phantom and in vivo results demonstrate substantially reduced background haze and improved visualization of low-intensity regions adjacent to bright structures, with an estimated $\sim$11$\times$ improvement in iron detection sensitivity relative to the conventional X-space CT approach. These advances enhance MPI image quality and quantitative reliability, supporting broader use of MPI in preclinical and future clinical imaging.</description>

      <title>The Role of High-Performance GPU Resources in Large Language Model Based Radiology Imaging Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16328v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are rapidly being applied to radiology, enabling automated image interpretation and report generation tasks. Their deployment in clinical practice requires both high diagnostic accuracy and low inference latency, which in turn demands powerful hardware. High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI. Advancing GPU infrastructure is essential for safe, efficient LLM-based radiology diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Photodiode quantum efficiency for 2-{\mu}m light in the signal band of gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 {\mu}m. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-{\mu}m laser light.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning of 3D Convolutional Foundation Models for ADHD Classification with Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children plays a crucial role in improving outcomes in education and mental health. Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.</description>

      <title>Validation of Fully-Automated Deep Learning-Based Fibroglandular Tissue Segmentation for Efficient and Reliable Quantitation of Background Parenchymal Enhancement in Breast MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) shows potential as a breast cancer risk marker. Clinically, BPE is qualitatively assessed by radiologists, but quantitative BPE measures offer potential for more precise risk evaluation. This study evaluated an existing open-source, fully-automated deep learning-based (DL-based) method for segmenting fibroglandular tissue (FGT) to quantify BPE and compared it to a semi-automated fuzzy c-means method. Using breast MRI examinations from 100 women, we evaluated segmentation agreement, concordance across quantitative BPE metrics, and associations with qualitative BPE. The quality of FGT segmentations from both methods was scored by a radiologist. While the DL-based and semi-automated methods showed good agreement for quantitative BPE measurements, DL-based measures more strongly correlated with qualitative BPE assessments and DL-based segmentations were scored as higher quality by the radiologist. Our findings suggest that DL-based FGT segmentation enhances efficiency for objective BPE quantification and may improve standardized breast cancer risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</description>
