      <title>Coalescence induced late departure of bubbles improves water electrolysis efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the effects of bubble collisions and coalescence on electrolysis performance using micro-electrodes in a 0.5 M H2SO4. We observe that the addition of electrolytes such as HClO4, despite increasing conductivity, significantly reduces energy conversion efficiency by inhibiting bubble coalescence. A phase diagram illustrates the trade-off between improved conductivity and inhibition of coalescence with varying concentrations of supporting electrolytes (HClO4 or Na2SO4) at different electrolysis current. Contrary to conventional understanding, we find that larger bubbles resulting from coalescence enhance efficiency. This can be attributed to the early release of smaller bubbles, approximately 10 micron in size, facilitated by the coalescence of the surface microbubble and the just-detached large bubble. Additionally, the merge of two bubbles, at a critical velocity of ~2 m/s, enhances agitation at the electrode surface that significantly improves electrolyte transport within the stagnant layer. These findings challenge conventional perspectives on bubble detachment size and suggest innovative approaches to optimize energy consumption in electrolysis, especially in systems where the bubble coalescence is inhibited, such as alkaline water electrolysis and the chlor-alkali industry.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate Dissociation Due to Heteromolecular Electronic Energy Transfer from Fluorobenzene Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of the near-UV photodissociation dynamics for monolayer (ML) quantities of CH$_3$I on thin films of a series of fluorobenzenes and benzene (1--25ML) grown on a Cu(100) substrate finds that in addition to gas-phase-like neutral photodissociation, CH$_3$I dissociation can be enhanced via photoabsorption in several of the thin films studied. Distinct CH$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy distributions are found for CH$_3$I photodissociation on C$_6$H$_5$F, 1,4-C$_6$H$_4$F$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ thin films, and distinguished from neutral photodissociation pathways using polarized incident light. The effective photodissociation cross section for CH$_3$I on these thin films is increased as compared to that for the higher F-count fluorobenzene thin films due to the additional photodissociation pathway available. Quenching by the metal substrate of the photoexcitation via this new pathway suggests a significantly longer timescale for excitation than that of neutral CH$_3$I photodissociation. The observations support a mechanism in which neutral photoexcitation in the thin film (i.e. an exciton) is transported to the interface with CH$_3$I, and transferring the electronic excitation to the CH$_3$I which then dissociates. The unimodal CH$_3$ photofragment distribution and observed kinetic energies on the fluorobenzene thin films suggest that the dissociation occurs via the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Molecular Simulations of Fabry-P\'erot Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing theoretical frameworks for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) beyond the single-mode approximation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of experiments with planar Fabry-P\'erot cavities. Herein, a generalized cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) scheme is developed to simulate VSC of a large ensemble of realistic molecules coupled to an arbitrary 1D or 2D photonic environment. This approach is built upon the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian in the normal mode basis and uses a grid representation of the molecular ensembles to reduce the computational cost. When simulating the polariton dispersion relation for a homogeneous distribution of molecules in planar Fabry-P\'erot cavities, our data highlight the importance of preserving the in-plane translational symmetry of the molecular distribution. In this homogeneous limit, CavMD yields the consistent polariton dispersion relation as analytic theory, i.e., incorporating many cavity modes with varying in-plane wave vectors ($k_{\parallel}$) produces the same spectrum as the system with a single cavity mode. Furthermore, CavMD reveals that the validity of the single mode approximation is challenged when nonequilibrium polariton dynamics are considered, as polariton-polariton scattering occurs between modes with nearest neighbor $k_{\parallel}$. Looking forward, our generalized CavMD approach may facilitate understanding vibrational polariton transport and condensation.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation with finite electric fields using Perturbed Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of condensed phase systems with external electric fields is crucial in myriad processes in nature and technology ranging from the field-directed motion of cells (galvanotaxis), to energy storage and conversion systems including supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells. Molecular simulation in the presence of electric fields would give important atomistic insight into these processes but applications of the most accurate methods such as ab-initio molecular dynamics are limited in scope by their computational expense. Here we introduce Perturbed Neural Network Potential Molecular Dynamics (PNNP MD) to push back the accessible time and length scales of such simulations at virtually no loss in accuracy. The total forces on the atoms are expressed in terms of the unperturbed potential energy surface represented by a standard neural network potential and a field-induced perturbation obtained from a series expansion of the field interaction truncated at first order. The latter is represented in terms of an equivariant graph neural network, trained on the atomic polar tensor. PNNP MD is shown to give excellent results for the dielectric relaxation dynamics, the dielectric constant and the field-dependent IR spectrum of liquid water when compared to ab-initio molecular dynamics or experiment, up to surprisingly high field strengths of about 0.2 V/A. This is remarkable because, in contrast to most previous approaches, the two neural networks on which PNNL MD is based are exclusively trained on zero-field molecular configurations demonstrating that the networks not only interpolate but also reliably extrapolate the field response. PNNP MD is based on rigorous theory yet it is simple, general, modular, and systematically improvable allowing us to obtain atomistic insight into the interaction of a wide range of condensed phase systems with external electric fields.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Polaritons with Broken In-Plane Translational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the calculation of polariton dispersion relations in planar Fabry-P\'erot microcavities, the single-mode approximation is usually applied. This approximation becomes invalid when the molecular distribution along the cavity mirror plane breaks the in-plane translational symmetry. Herein, both perturbative theory and numerical calculations have been performed to study polariton dispersion relations with various in-plane molecular distribution patterns under vibrational strong coupling conditions. If a homogeneous in-plane molecular distribution is modulated by sinusoidal fluctuations, in addition to a pair of upper and lower polariton branches, a discrete number of side polariton branches may emerge in the polariton dispersion relation. Moreover, for a Gaussian molecular density distribution, only two, yet significantly broadened polariton branches exist in the spectra. This polariton linewidth broadening is due to the breakdown of the single-mode approximation and the scattering between cavity modes at different in-plane frequencies, which is distinguished from known causes of polariton broadening such as the homogeneous broadening of molecules and the cavity loss. Associated with the broadened polariton branches, under the Gaussian in-plane inhomogeneity, a significant amount of the VSC eigenstates contain a non-zero contribution from the cavity photon mode at zero in-plane frequency, blurring the distinction between the bright and the dark modes. Looking forward, our theoretical investigation should facilitate the experimental exploration of vibrational polaritons with patterned in-plane molecular density distributions.</description>

      <title>Solving vibrational Hamiltonians with neural canonical transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of polyatomic molecules around their equilibrium positions can be regarded as quantum coupled anharmonic oscillators. Solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equations can interpret or predict experimental spectra of molecules. In this study, we develop a novel approach to solve excited states of anharmonic vibrational systems. The normal coordinates of molecules are transformed into new coordinates through a normalizing flow parameterized by a neural network, facilitating the construction of a set of orthogonal many-body variational wavefunctions. Our methodology has been validated on an exactly solvable $64$-dimensional coupled harmonic oscillator, yielding numerical results with a relative error on the order of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, the neural canonical transformations are also applied to calculate the energy levels of two specific molecules, acetonitrile ($\text{C}\text{H}_3\text{CN}$) and ethylene oxide ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{O}$) involving $12$ and $15$ vibrational modes respectively, which are in agreement with experimental findings. One of the key advantages of our approach is its flexibility concerning the potential energy surface, requiring no specific form for its application. Moreover, this method can be easily implemented on large-scale distributed computing platforms, making it particularly suitable for investigating more complex vibrational structures.</description>

      <title>Higher Derivative Muffin Tin Orbitals (HDMTO) and Higher Derivative Koringa Khon and Rostoker (HDKKR) methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a Linearized version of the Koringa Khon and Rostoker method (LKKR) and show it to be equivalent to the Linearized Muffin Tin Orbitals method (LMTO). We then present higher derivative versions of both methods, e.g. HDKKR and HDMTO and show them to be partially distinct (not equivalent). In particular HDKKR basis set does not have an equivalent ground state for the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian as the HDKKR basis set and has greater variational power than the HDMTO one. Because the KS method, for Density Functional Theory (DFT), is variational HDKKR will give better ground state energies than HDMTO. However HDKKR is much harder to work with then HDMTO requiring much greater computer resources so HDMTO can often be preferred.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Nature of $\pi$-hydrogen Bonding in Liquid Water and Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aromatic compounds form an unusual kind of hydrogen bond with water and ammonia molecules, known as the $\pi$-hydrogen bond. In this work, we report ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations enhanced by machine-learning potentials to study the structural, dynamical, and spectroscopic properties of solutions of benzene in liquid water and ammonia. Specifically, we model the spatial distribution functions of the solvents around the benzene molecule, establish the $\pi$-hydrogen bonding interaction as a prominent structural motive, and set up existence criteria to distinguish the $\pi$-hydrogen bonded configurations. These serve as a structural basis to calculate binding affinities of the solvent molecules in $\pi$hydrogen bonds, identify an anticooperativity effect across the aromatic ring in water (but not ammonia), and estimate $\pi$-hydrogen bond lifetimes in both solvents. Finally, we model hydration-shell-resolved vibrational spectra to clearly identify the vibrational signature of this structural motif in our simulations. These decomposed spectra corroborate previous experimental findings for benzene in water, offer additional insights, and further emphasize the contrast between $\pi$-hydrogen bonds in water and in ammonia. Our simulations provide a comprehensive picture of the studied phenomenon and, at the same time, serve as a meaningful \textit{ab initio} reference for an accurate description of $\pi$-hydrogen bonding using empirical force fields in more complex situations, such as the hydration of biological interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of thin films is typically described using phenomenological models whose connection to the microscopic particle dynamics is a subject of ongoing research. Existing methods based on density functional theory provide a good description of static thin films, but are not sufficient for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. This method allows to directly obtain the correct gradient dynamics structure along with microscopic expressions for the mobility and the free energy. Our results are verified against molecular dynamics simulations for both simple fluids and polymers.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic trapping of N$_2$ molecules in high Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N$_2$ molecules traveling in pulsed supersonic beams have been excited from their ${\mathrm{X\,^1\Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^+}}$ ground electronic state to long-lived Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers between 39 and 48 using a resonance-enhanced two-color three-photon excitation scheme. The Rydberg states populated had static electric dipole moments exceeding $5000$ D which allowed deceleration of the molecules to rest in the laboratory-fixed frame of reference and three-dimensional trapping using inhomogeneous electric fields. The trapped molecules were confined for up to 10 ms, with effective trap decay time constants increasing with principal quantum number, and ranging from 450$\mu$s to 700 $\mu$s. These observations, and comparison with the results of similar measurements with He atoms, indicate that the decay dynamics of the trapped Rydberg N$_2$ molecules are dominated by spontaneous emission and do not exhibit significant contributions from effects of intramolecular interactions that lead to non-radiative decay.</description>

      <title>NSGAN: A Non-Dominant Sorting Optimisation-Based Generative Adversarial Design Framework for Alloy Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and discovery of new materials is fundamental to advancing scientific and technological innovation. The recent emergence of the materials genome concept holds great promise in revolutionising materials science by enabling the systematic utilisation of data for efficient prediction and optimisation of superior materials. However, the materials genome approach can be stymied by the vast complexity of design spaces, which often demand substantial computational resources and sophisticated data processing capabilities. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel generative design framework called the non-dominant sorting optimisation-based generative adversarial networks (NSGAN). Capitalising on the synergies of genetic algorithms (GA) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), NSGAN provides a robust and efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional multi-objective optimisation design problems. To validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we applied the model to a comprehensive dataset of aluminium alloys. Additionally, an online tool was created as a supplementary resource, offering a brief introduction to this innovative method for the wider scientific community. This study explores the potential of a predictive and data-driven approach in material design, indicating a promising pathway for widespread applications in the field of materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth examination of the $GW$ approximation of Green's function many-body perturbation theory by detailing both its theoretical and practical aspects in the realm of quantum chemistry. First, the quasiparticle context is introduced before delving into the derivation of Hedin's equations. From these, we explain how to derive the well-known $GW$ approximation of the self-energy. In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community.</description>
