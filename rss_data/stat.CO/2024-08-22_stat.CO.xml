      <title>A Multiple Random Scan Strategy for Latent Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11725v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Space (LS) network models project the nodes of a network on a $d$-dimensional latent space to achieve dimensionality reduction of the network while preserving its relevant features. Inference is often carried out within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Nonetheless, it is well-known that the computational time for this set of models increases quadratically with the number of nodes. In this work, we build on the Random-Scan (RS) approach to propose an MCMC strategy that alleviates the computational burden for LS models while maintaining the benefits of a general-purpose technique. We call this novel strategy Multiple RS (MRS). This strategy is effective in reducing the computational cost by a factor without severe consequences on the MCMC draws. Moreover, we introduce a novel adaptation strategy that consists of a probabilistic update of the set of latent coordinates of each node. Our Adaptive MRS adapts the acceptance rate of the Metropolis step to adjust the probability of updating the latent coordinates. We show via simulation that the Adaptive MRS approach performs better than MRS in terms of mixing. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a multi-layer temporal LS model and show how our adaptive strategy may be beneficial to empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Stereographic MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to tackle the problem of sampling from heavy tailed, high dimensional distributions via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, Yang, Latuszy\'nski, and Roberts (2022) (arXiv:2205.12112) introduces the stereographic projection as a tool to compactify $\mathbb{R}^d$ and transform the problem into sampling from a density on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$. However, the improvement in algorithmic efficiency, as well as the computational cost of the implementation, are still significantly impacted by the parameters used in this transformation.
  To address this, we introduce adaptive versions of the Stereographic Random Walk (SRW), the Stereographic Slice Sampler (SSS), and the Stereographic Bouncy Particle Sampler (SBPS), which automatically update the parameters of the algorithms as the run progresses. The adaptive setup allows us to better exploit the power of the stereographic projection, even when the target distribution is neither centered nor homogeneous. We present a simulation study showing each algorithm's robustness to starting far from the mean in heavy tailed, high dimensional settings, as opposed to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We establish a novel framework for proving convergence of adaptive MCMC algorithms over collections of simultaneously uniformly ergodic Markov operators, including continuous time processes. This framework allows us to prove LLNs and a CLT for our adaptive Stereographic algorithms.</description>

      <title>armadillo: An R Package to Use the Armadillo C++ Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces 'armadillo', a new R package that integrates the powerful Armadillo C++ library for linear algebra into the R programming environment. Targeted primarily at social scientists and other non-programmers, this article explains the computational benefits of moving code to C++ in terms of speed and syntax. We provide a comprehensive overview of Armadillo's capabilities, highlighting its user-friendly syntax akin to MATLAB and its efficiency for computationally intensive tasks. The 'armadillo' package simplifies a part of the process of using C++ within R by offering additional ease of integration for those who require high-performance linear algebra operations in their R workflows. This work aims to bridge the gap between computational efficiency and accessibility, making advanced linear algebra operations more approachable for R users without extensive programming backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Locally Adaptive Random Walk Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with a new Dynamic Shrinkage Process (DSP) in (log) variances. Unlike classical Stochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low prediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in volatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian Trend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that this attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and medicine, among others.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-COM and SIMO-SEN) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer (OB) bounds. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: \textit{i}) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and \textit{ii}) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>Online Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>
