      <title>Portal for High-Precision Atomic Data and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We've developed a scalable and sustainable online atomic data portal with an automated interface for easy update and addition of new data. The current portal provides energies, transition matrix elements, transition rates, radiative lifetimes, branching ratios, polarizabilities, hyperfine constants, and other data, for 28 atoms and ions. It also features an interactive polarizability plotting interface for neutral atoms and singly-charged ions. The data production is supported by recent developments of open-access atomic software based on our research codes, including new workflow algorithms, which allow large volumes of such data to be generated with automated accuracy assessments. This entails a new method of comparing our calculated values with data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database. All calculated values include estimated uncertainties. Data for more systems will be added in the future. Experimental values are included with references, where high-precision data are available.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent explorations of quantized solitons transport in optical waveguides have thrust nonlinear topological pumping into the spotlight. In this work, we introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer (BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezer-controlled entanglement gates with trapped ion qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an entanglement protocol where ions illuminated by optical tweezers serve as control qubits. We experimentally demonstrate this proposal with a controlled M$\o$lmer-S$\o$rensen operation on a three-ion chain, analogous to the canonical Toffoli gate. Our demonstration features cases in which the control qubit was in one of its logical basis states, and not in their superposition, due to dephasing by tweezer beam intensity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our protocol generalizes to a broad class of unitary operations and larger qubit systems, enabling a single-pulse implementation of $n$-controlled unitaries.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless tune-out trapping for a lanthanide-alkali quantum gas mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gas mixtures offer a wide field of research, ranging from few-body physics of impurities to many-body physics with emergent long-range interactions and ultracold molecular gases. Achieving precision control of mixtures is much harder than for single-component gases and, consequently, the respective techniques are less developed. Here we report on a decisive step forward in this direction by realizing dissipationless and fully differential optical control of the motional degrees of freedom of one of the species without affecting the other. This is achieved in a novel Bose-Fermi mixture with extreme mass imbalance, erbium-166 and lithium-6. Our experiments pave the way to a new generation of precision many-body experiments with quantum gas mixtures with unprecedented long lifetimes and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Electric Dipole Moment of AlCl by Stark Level Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Using Stark shift spectroscopy, we derive values for the dipole moments in the body-fixed frame of the two lowest vibrational states for the $X^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state, $\mu_X(v''=0) = -1.679$ D and $\mu_X(v'' = 1) = -1.761$ D, and for the $A^1\Pi$ state, $\mu_A(v' = 0) = -1.030$ D and $\mu_A(v' = 1) = -1.052$ D. We also show that the ab initio calculations of the dipole moment and $T_e$ energy of AlCl are sensitive to the level of treatment of the spin-orbit orbit coupling. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic dynamics in a V-type quantum system by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic (1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with a neutral atom processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing experiments are transitioning from running on physical qubits to using encoded, logical qubits. Fault-tolerant computation can identify and correct errors, and has the potential to enable the dramatically reduced logical error rates required for valuable algorithms. However, it requires flexible control of high-fidelity operations performed on large numbers of qubits. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation on a quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual neutral Ytterbium atom. The operations are designed so that key error sources convert to atom loss, which can be detected by imaging. Full connectivity is enabled by atom movement. We demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits encoded into 48 atoms, at once catching errors and correcting for, on average 1.8, lost atoms. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded into 112 atoms, showing better-than-physical error rates. In both cases, "erasure conversion," changing errors into a form that can be detected independently from qubit state, improves circuit performance. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistics of Two Identical Particles and Modified Hong-Ou-Mandel Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>
