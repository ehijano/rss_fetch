      <title>Upper Limit on the Non-Gravitational Acceleration and Lower Limits on the Nucleus Mass and Diameter of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use astrometric data on 3I/ATLAS compiled by the Minor Planet Center from May 15 to September 23, 2025, and derive an upper limit on any statistically significant deviation from the best-fit gravity-based trajectory. The residuals imply that the non-gravitational acceleration is smaller than $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm au\,d^{-2}}$. Based on the total mass-loss rate and outflow speed inferred from JWST data on August 6, 2025, we derive lower limits on the mass and diameter of 3I/ATLAS of $3.3 \times 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$ and $5\,{\rm km}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple dynamical classes in the Kuiper belt via disk dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar System formation model.</description>

      <title>A Combined TESS and Ground-based Study of Transit Timing Variations in HAT-P-16, TOI-1516 and TOI-2046 Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results for the hot Jupiters HAT-P-16b, TOI-1516b, and TOI-2046b, based on photometric observations collected using both space- and ground-based facilities. Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time span with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University Application and Research Center (Adiyaman, T\"{u}rkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope at the T\"{u}rkiye National Observatory (TUG, T\"{u}rkiye). Through a combination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from TESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated linear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were analyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The resulting BIC($\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is statistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period model is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were computed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays a strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold, suggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The higher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible presence of an additional body in the system is less convincing. In contrast, the much higher FAP value (0.0196) for TOI-2046b implies that there are no statistically significant TTVs.</description>

      <title>Limb Asymmetries on WASP-39b: A Multi-GCM Comparison of Chemistry, Clouds, and Hazes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.</description>

      <title>Extreme Geomagnetic Storm on Early Earth Induced by Corotating Interaction Regions from the Young Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multiwavelength observations of young solar analogs suggest that the young Sun in the first 600 Myr was a magnetically active star that produced an X-ray and Extreme-UV (EUV) bright corona, fast, massive stellar wind, and energetic eruptive events. These outputs affected magnetospheric environments of early Earth and young rocky exoplanets. The interaction of the fast solar wind with the slow wind produced strong shocks from Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) that provided high dynamic pressure on the magnetospheres of early Venus, Earth, and Mars. Here, we apply the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), coupled with the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to simulate the response of the magnetospheric environments and associated Joule heating deposited in the upper atmosphere of early Earth as it passed through a CIR shock from the young Sun. The model suggests ~ 40% closer dayside magnetopause standoff distance, and higher negative SYMH, Cross Polar Cap Potentials (CPCP), atmospheric Joule heating, Field Aligned Currents (FAC), electron precipitations, and equatorward polar cap expansions, comparable or exceeding those of recent intense and super geomagnetic storms. The magnetic storm produces dawn-dusk asymmetries in the polar cap boundary arising from the stellar magnetic field By. The proton density enhancements during the CIR event are the dominant factor in the overall dynamic pressure for resulting electron precipitation and Joule heating deposited into the Earth's ionosphere. We discuss implications for the magnetospheric states and associated habitability conditions on early Earth and young rocky exoplanets around magnetically active solar-like stars.</description>

      <title>Multidisciplinary analysis of pit craters at Hale Crater, Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pit craters are circular to subcircular depressions that lack a rim and ejecta layer and typically have a conical shape. There are several mechanisms that can explain the formation of such depressions and they are associated with collapse due to the removal of subsurface material. Possible origins of pit craters include: volcanic processes (collapse of lava tubes, magmatic chambers, intrusion of dikes), karstic dissolution, extensional faulting or volatile processes. Here, we propose that pit craters are stratigraphically on top of the ice-related landforms and present complex relationships with the gullies. The spatial relationship between the pits and these structures, along with the absence of evidence of present or past volcanic activity and the lack of evidence of any extensional faulting allows us to propose that the origin of the pit craters in the study area might be related to some volatile process. We propose here that these particular pit craters at Hale crater, are morphologically similar to Icelandic depressions located in a glacial environment. We conclude that the landforms found in the area are in close relation with glacial or periglacial conditions and pit craters might be formed by sublimation/melting of ground ice.</description>

      <title>Starshades as technosignatures in direct imaging phase curves: Application to the Habitable Worlds Observatory targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star's luminosity increases as it evolves along the Main Sequence (MS), which inevitably results in a higher surface temperature for planets in orbit around the star. Technologically advanced civilizations may tackle this issue by installing artificial structures -- starshades -- which can reduce the radiation received by the planet. Starshades, if they exist, are potentially detectable with current or near-future technology. We have simulated phase curve signatures in direct imaging of hypothetical starshades in systems targeted by the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), which will be tasked with searching for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. The starshade is assumed to be a circular, reflecting surface placed at the inner Lagrange point between the star and the planet. Our results show that the phase curve of a starshade has a distinct shape compared to that of a typical planet. The phase curve signature lies above the expected $1\sigma=10^{-11}$ single-visit precision in contrast ratio of the telescope for 70.8% of the target stars for the expected inner working angle (IWA) of around 60 mas. If the IWA can be reduced to 45 mas, the percentage of stars above the $1\sigma$ limit increases to 96.7%. With a sufficiently small IWA, HWO should be able to detect anomalies in light curves caused by starshades or similar highly-reflective surfaces -- which could serve as key indicators for technologically advanced civilizations.</description>

      <title>Ion-neutral chemistry at icy moons: the case of Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icy moons orbiting giant planets are often described as airless bodies though they host an exosphere where collisions between neutral species are scarce. In the case of Ganymede, the neutral composition is dominated by $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$. Past observations by Galileo showed that Ganymede hosts an ionosphere and those by Juno revealed the presence of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, an ion species only stemming from ion-neutral collisions. $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ detection suggests that ions and neutrals might still collide and be the source of new ion species on icy moons. We examine Ganymede's ability to host a more diverse ionosphere in terms of ion composition than previously thought and predict its variety. We upgraded our test-particle code of Ganymede's ionosphere, formerly collisionless, to include ion-neutral collisions in a probabilistic manner. The updated code is applied to three Galileo flybys of Ganymede that were investigated in the absence of chemistry. Both sets of simulations have been compared and the effect of ion-neutral chemistry has been assessed. We show that in the case of an exosphere predominantly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$, the ionosphere is made not only of their associated cations but also of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$, $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$, and $\mathrm{O_2H^+}$. Simulations reveal that, depending on the location, the contribution of $\mathrm{H_3^+}$ and $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ to the ion composition may be significant. Strong dayside/nightside and Jovian/anti-Jovian asymmetries in the ion composition are identified. Our findings are key to interpreting Juno and future JUICE ion mass spectrometer datasets.</description>

      <title>The Origins &amp; Reservoirs of Exocomets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bodies exist in distinct populations within their planetary systems. These reservoir populations hold a range of compositions, which to first order are dependent on formation location relative to their star. We provide a general overview of the nature of the reservoirs that source exocomets, from the influence of the stellar environment through planetesimal formation to comparisons with Solar System populations. Once transitioned from a young protoplanetary disc to a debris disc, a star can expect to be rained with exocomets. While exocomets are predominantly detected to date at A-type stars, planetesimals plausibly exist across a range of stellar masses, based on exoplanet abundance, debris disc occurrence and white dwarf infall.</description>

      <title>Small Near-Earth Objects in the Taurid Resonant Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taurid Resonant Swarm (TRS) within the Taurid Complex hosts dynamically-concentrated debris in a 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Fireball observations have confirmed that the TRS is rich in sub-meter-sized particles, but whether this enhancement extends to larger, asteroid-sized objects remains unclear. Here we reanalyze the data obtained by a Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) campaign during the 2022 TRS encounter, and find that the TRS may host up to $\sim10^2$ Tunguska-sized objects and up to $\sim10^3$ Chelyabinsk-sized objects, the latter of which agrees the estimate derived from bolide records. This translates to an impact frequency of less than once every 4 million years. However, we caution that these numbers are based on the unverified assumption that the orbital distribution of the TRS asteroids follows that of fireball-sized meteoroids. Future wide-field facilities, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, could take advantage of TRS's close approaches in the 2020-30s and validate the constraints of the asteroid-sized objects in the TRS.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

Abstract: The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time observatory control.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Pathways to the Misalignment of the VHS 1256-1257 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Low-mass companions to nine stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an independent spectroscopic and radial velocity analysis for nine stars from the Pennsylvania-Toru\'n Planet Search. For BD+24 4697, we present an updated true companion's mass (0.16$\pm$0.02 \, M$_{\odot}$), as well as evidence of stellar activity. For BD+54 1640 and BD+65 1241 we present true masses of companions, $m = 0.15 \pm 0.04\,M_\odot$ and $m = 0.091 \pm 0.005\,M_\odot$, respectively. For BD+63 974 and BD+69 935 we find low mass companions with $m \sin i = 0.046 \pm 0.001\,M_\odot$ and $m \sin i = 0.090 \pm 0.005\,M_\odot$. For BD+52 1281, BD+54 1382, TYC 2704-2680-1, and TYC 3525-02043-1 we present evidence of low-mass companions with $m \sin i$ of 0.115 $\pm 0.006\,M_\odot$, 0.083 $\pm 0.007\,M_\odot$, 0.279 $\pm 0.009\,M_\odot$, and $0.064 \pm 0.006\,M_\odot$, respectively. Consequently, BD+54 1382, BD+63 974, BD+65 1241, BD+69 935 and TYC 3525-02043-1 appear to be Brown Dwarf host candidates.</description>

      <title>High Proper Motion Discoveries from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the third data release of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey to locate previously unrecognized high proper motion objects. We identify a total of 127 new discoveries with total proper motions $\gtrsim$300 mas yr$^{-1}$. A significant fraction of these sources with counterparts in the Gaia DR3 catalog are found to be distant ($&gt;$100 pc) low-mass stars, where their large tangential velocities and placement on color-magnitude diagrams suggest that they are likely low-metallicity M-type subdwarfs. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the low-mass and low-metallicity for two such sources. Using available optical and infrared photometry, we estimate the spectral type for all non-Gaia sources and find 10 likely late-M dwarfs, 15 objects with colors most consistent with L-type dwarfs, and 9 possible T-type dwarfs. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to confirm spectral types and further characterize these new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Architectures of Multiplanet Systems from Kepler, K2, and TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanet surveys like Kepler, TESS, and K2 have shown that planetary systems are common in our galaxy. These surveys, along with several others, have identified thousands of planetary candidates, with more than five thousand having already been confirmed. Many of these planetary systems host multiple planets. As we discover more multiplanet systems, notable trends begin to appear in the data. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs in multiplanet systems in the most recent Kepler, TESS and K2 data, paying particular attention to pairs in first order mean motion resonance (MMR). We compare a recent Kepler catalog with the DR25 data release. We also compare TESS and K2 against this recently released Kepler data. To verify the significance of our findings against selection bias, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of multiplanet systems in the TESS catalog, finding an excess of planet pairs near the 2 (2:1), and 1.5 (3:2) period ratios, both exceeding the 99\% confidence interval. We also find a significant peak at the 2.19 period ratio, which exceeds the 90\% confidence interval. Using a lower limit for period ratios determined by the period of the inner planet proposed in Steffen &amp; Farr (2013), we identify two planet pairs orbiting M dwarf stars in a very tight ratio. We also note a likely misidentified planet pair orbiting an FGK type star, which if further study proves to be true, would indicate that only planets orbiting M dwarf stars may violate this limit.</description>

      <title>GPI+SPHERE detection of a 6.1 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ circumbinary planet around HD 143811</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to its sensitivity to wide-orbit giant exoplanets, direct imaging is uniquely positioned to shed light on the interplay between protoplanetary disks and stellar hosts. In addition to constraining formation models, new detections are natural benchmarks for an atmospheric characterization. The COBREX project performed an extensive reanalysis of archival observations from SPHERE and GPI using advanced post-processing techniques, that enhanced the detection sensitivity at close separation. Newly found companion candidates are being followed up to confirm new planets. Following the detection of a companion candidate around the young ($\sim 15$ Myr) binary star HD 143811, we collected a new observation with SPHERE@VLT (0.95-1.67 $\mu$m) to confirm the presence of the source and to assess its physical bond to the target. We report the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting HD 143811 at a projected separation of 0.43" $\sim 60$ au. Based on a 9-year-long baseline, we derive a mostly face-on and low-eccentricity orbit with a period of $320 ^{+250}_{-90}$ years. The luminosity of the planet, constrained through the H-band spectrum from GPI, H-band photometry from SPHERE/IRDIS and YJ upper limits from SPHERE/IFS, allows us to place strong constraints on the intrinsic temperature of the planet (T$_{\text{int}} = 1000 \pm 30$K), which corresponds to a mass of $6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.9} ~M_{\text{Jup}}$. HD 143811(AB)b is the second planet ever discovered by GPI. It joins the small cohort of circumbinary planets discovered through imaging and becomes a prime target for follow-up formation, dynamical, and characterization studies.</description>

      <title>Innovative SiC ultraviolet instrumentation development with potential applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>
