      <title>Demonstration of MaskSearch: Efficiently Querying Image Masks for Machine Learning Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate MaskSearch, a system designed to accelerate queries over databases of image masks generated by machine learning models. MaskSearch formalizes and accelerates a new category of queries for retrieving images and their corresponding masks based on mask properties, which support various applications, from identifying spurious correlations learned by models to exploring discrepancies between model saliency and human attention. This demonstration makes the following contributions:(1) the introduction of MaskSearch's graphical user interface (GUI), which enables interactive exploration of image databases through mask properties, (2) hands-on opportunities for users to explore MaskSearch's capabilities and constraints within machine learning workflows, and (3) an opportunity for conference attendees to understand how MaskSearch accelerates queries over image masks.</description>

      <title>Enc2DB: A Hybrid and Adaptive Encrypted Query Processing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As cloud computing gains traction, data owners are outsourcing their data to cloud service providers (CSPs) for Database Service (DBaaS), bringing in a deviation of data ownership and usage, and intensifying privacy concerns, especially with potential breaches by hackers or CSP insiders. To address that, encrypted database services propose encrypting every tuple and query statement before submitting to the CSP, ensuring data confidentiality when the CSP is honest-but-curious, or even compromised. Existing solutions either employ property preserving cryptography schemes, which can perform certain operations over ciphertext without decrypting the data over the CSP, or utilize trusted execution environment (TEE) to safeguard data and computations from the CSP. Based on these efforts, we introduce Enc2DB, a novel secure database system, following a hybrid strategy on PostgreSQL and openGauss. We present a micro-benchmarking test and self-adaptive mode switch strategy that can dynamically choose the best execution path (cryptography or TEE) to answer a given query. Besides, we also design and implement a ciphertext index compatible with native cost model and query optimizers to accelerate query processing. Empirical study over TPC-C test justifies that Enc2DB outperforms pure TEE and cryptography solutions, and our ciphertext index implementation also outperforms the state-of-the-art cryptographic-based system.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Sampling over Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling over joins is a fundamental task in large-scale data analytics. Instead of computing the full join results, which could be massive, a uniform sample of the join results would suffice for many purposes, such as answering analytical queries or training machine learning models. In this paper, we study the problem of how to maintain a random sample over joins while the tuples are streaming in. Without the join, this problem can be solved by some simple and classical reservoir sampling algorithms. However, the join operator makes the problem significantly harder, as the join size can be polynomially larger than the input. We present a new algorithm for this problem that achieves a near-linear complexity. The key technical components are a generalized reservoir sampling algorithm that supports a predicate, and a dynamic index for sampling over joins. We also conduct extensive experiments on both graph and relational data over various join queries, and the experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement over the state of the art.</description>

      <title>IA2: Leveraging Instance-Aware Index Advisor with Reinforcement Learning for Diverse Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Instance-Aware Index Advisor (IA2), a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for optimizing index selection in databases facing large action spaces of potential candidates. IA2 introduces the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient - Temporal Difference State-Wise Action Refinery (TD3-TD-SWAR) model, enabling efficient index selection by understanding workload-index dependencies and employing adaptive action masking. This method includes a comprehensive workload model, enhancing its ability to adapt to unseen workloads and ensuring robust performance across diverse database environments. Evaluation on benchmarks such as TPC-H reveals IA2's suggested indexes' performance in enhancing runtime, securing a 40% reduction in runtime for complex TPC-H workloads compared to scenarios without indexes, and delivering a 20% improvement over existing state-of-the-art DRL-based index advisors.</description>
