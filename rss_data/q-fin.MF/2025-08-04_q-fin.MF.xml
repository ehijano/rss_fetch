      <title>Time-Varying Factor-Augmented Models for Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes-large-cap U.S. technology equities and major cryptocurrencies-over both short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) horizons. Using a suite of linear and non-linear AI-driven models, we consistently observe substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and economic value. Notably, a practical pairs-trading strategy built on our forecasts delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and profitability, particularly under adverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>An analysis of linear regression and neural networks approximation for the pricing of swing options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear regression, firstly introduced for the pricing of American-style options, has since been expanded to include swing options pricing. Swing options price may be viewed as the solution to a Backward Dynamic Programming Principle, which involves a conditional expectation known as the continuation value. The approximation of the continuation value using linear regression involves two levels of approximation. First, the continuation value is replaced by an orthogonal projection over a subspace spanned by a finite set of $m$ squared-integrable functions yielding a first approximation $V^m$ of the swing value function. In this paper, we prove that, with well-chosen regression functions, $V^m$ converges to the swing actual price $V$ as $m \to + \infty$. A similar result is proved when classic regression functions are replaced by neural networks. For both methods (linear regression and neural networks), we analyze the second level of approximation involving practical computation of the swing price using Monte Carlo simulations and yielding an approximation $V^{m, N}$ (where $N$ denotes the Monte Carlo sample size). Especially, we prove that $V^{m, N} \to V^m$ as $N \to + \infty$ for both methods and using a Hilbert basis assumption in the linear regression. Besides, a convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \big)$ is proved in the linear regression case.</description>

      <title>Convex ordering for stochastic control: the (path dependent) swing contracts case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate propagation of convexity and convex ordering on a typical discrete-time stochastic optimal control problem, namely the pricing of swing option. The dynamics of the underlying asset is modelled by the Euler scheme of a Brownian diffusion with affine drift, and convex volatility. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the functional monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying dynamics. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein's formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the volatility dynamics can be relaxed with a semi-convexity assumption. Finally, to validate our results, we also conduct numerical illustrations.</description>
