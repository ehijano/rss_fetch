      <title>Capacitive Touch Sensor Modeling With a Physics-informed Neural Network and Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations are the fundamental equations for understanding electric and magnetic field interactions and play a crucial role in designing and optimizing sensor systems like capacitive touch sensors, which are widely prevalent in automotive switches and smartphones. Ensuring robust functionality and stability of the sensors in dynamic environments necessitates profound domain expertise and computationally intensive multi-physics simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based surrogate model to accelerate the design process. The PINN model solves the governing electrostatic equations describing the interaction between a finger and a capacitive sensor. Inputs include spatial coordinates from a 3D domain encompassing the finger, sensor, and PCB, along with finger distances. By incorporating the electrostatic equations directly into the neural network's loss function, the model captures the underlying physics. The learned model thus serves as a surrogate sensor model on which inference can be carried out in seconds for different experimental setups without the need to run simulations. Efficacy results evaluated on unseen test cases demonstrate the significant potential of PINNs in accelerating the development and design optimization of capacitive touch sensors.</description>

      <title>Effect of thermal fluctuations on the average shape of a graphene nanosheet suspended in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanosheets display large hydrodynamic slip lengths in most solvents, and because of this, adopt a stable orientation in a shear flow instead of rotating when thermal fluctuations are negligible [Kamal et al., Nature Comm., 11.1,2020]. In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged 'S' shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is comparable to the shape predicted when neglecting thermal fluctuations. The stable 'S' shape adopted by the particle results primarily from the normal hydrodynamic traction, which is sensitive to the orientation of the particle with respect to the flow direction. Our results imply that thermally-induced shape fluctuations have a relatively minor effect on the time-averaged rheology of dilute suspensions of graphene nanosheets for relatively large but finite P\'eclet numbers.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Time Series Prediction with a GHz-rate Photonic Spiking Neural Network built with a single VCSEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic technologies hold significant potential for creating innovative, high-speed, efficient and hardware-friendly neuromorphic computing platforms. Neuromorphic photonic methods leveraging ubiquitous, technologically mature and cost-effective Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are of notable interest. VCSELs have demonstrated the capability to replicate neuronal optical spiking responses at ultrafast rates. These characteristics have triggered research into applying these key-enabling devices in spike-based photonic computing. Here, a GHz-rate photonic Spiking Neural Network (p-SNN) using a single VCSEL is reported, and its application to a complex time-series prediction task is demonstrated for the first time. The VCSEL p-SNN combined with a technique to induce network memory, is applied to perform multi-step-ahead predictions of a chaotic time-series. By providing the feedforward p-SNN with only two temporally separated inputs excellent accuracy is experimentally demonstrated over a range of prediction horizons. VCSEL-based p-SNNs therefore offer ultrafast, efficient operation in complex predictive tasks whilst enabling hardware implementations. The inherent attributes and performance of VCSEL p-SNNs hold great promise for use in future light-enabled neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>

      <title>M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes family materials with Dirac nodal loop, strong light-harvesting ability, long carrier lifetime and conduction-band valley spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes, as emerging MXenes-like materials, also have wide structural spaces and various chemical and physical properties. Using first-principles and high-throughput calculations, we have built an online library (\url{https://moenes.online}) for M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes family materials from basic summaries, mechanical, phonon and electron aspects, based on their structural diversities from 2 stoichiometric ratios, 11 early-transition metals, 4 typical functional groups and 4 oxygen group elements. Compared to MXenes, the main advantage of M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes at present is that we have discovered 14 direct semiconductors, which greatly increases the number of direct semiconductors and the range of band gap values in the MXenes family. Among them, 1T-Ti$_{2}$\textit{\textbf{O}}F$_{2}$ (\textbf{\textit{O}}=O, S, Se) reveal tunable semiconducting features and strong light-harvesting ability ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region. Besides, 2H- and 1T-Y$_{2}$TeO$_{2}$ have a long carrier lifetime of 2.38 and 1.24 ns, originating from their spatially distinguished VBM and CBM states and long dephasing times. In addition, 2H-Zr$_{2}$O(O)$_{2}$ shows spin-valley coupling phenomena, and the valley spin splitting is apparent and robust in its conduction band ($\sim$85 meV). Therefore, M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes have a wealth of physical properties, not limited to those reported here, and future studies of these emerging M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes are appealing.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed transformer neural operator for learning generalized solutions of initial boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points. The code is available at $\texttt{https://github.com/quest-lab-iisc/PINTO}$</description>

      <title>Supersonic Shear and Wall-Bounded Flows With Body-Fitted Meshes Using the Semi-Lagrangian Lattice Boltzmann Method: Boundary Schemes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulations of incompressible flows are nowadays common and well-established. However, for compressible turbulent flows with strong variable density and intrinsic compressibility effects, results are relatively scarce. Only recently, progress was made regarding compressible LBM, usually applied to simple one and two-dimensional test cases due to the increased computational expense. The recently developed semi-Lagrangian lattice Boltzmann method (SLLBM) is capable of simulating two- and three-dimensional viscous compressible flows. This paper presents bounce-back, thermal, inlet, and outlet boundary conditions new to the method and their application to problems including heated or cooled walls, often required for supersonic flow cases. Using these boundary conditions, the SLLBM's capabilities are demonstrated in various test cases, including a supersonic 2D NACA-0012 airfoil, flow around a 3D sphere, and, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the 3D simulation of a supersonic turbulent channel flow at a bulk Mach number of Ma=1.5 and a 3D temporal supersonic compressible mixing layer at convective Mach numbers ranging from Ma=0.3 to Ma=1.2. The results show that the compressible SLLBM is able to adequately capture intrinsic and variable density compressibility effects.</description>

      <title>Free-Energy Machine for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems is pivotal in both scientific and technological domains, within academic research and industrial applications. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in the development of accelerated methods that leverage sophisticated models and harness the power of advanced computational hardware. Despite the advancements, a critical challenge persists, the dual demand for both high efficiency and broad generality in solving problems. In this work, we propose a general method, Free-Energy Machine (FEM), based on the ideas of free-energy minimization in statistical physics, combined with automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization in machine learning. The algorithm is flexible, solving various combinatorial optimization problems using a unified framework, and is efficient, naturally utilizing massive parallel computational devices such as graph processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We benchmark our algorithm on various problems including the maximum cut problems, balanced minimum cut problems, and maximum $k$-satisfiability problems, scaled to millions of variables, across both synthetic, real-world, and competition problem instances. The findings indicate that our algorithm not only exhibits exceptional speed but also surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for individual problems. This highlights that the interdisciplinary fusion of statistical physics and machine learning opens the door to delivering cutting-edge methodologies that will have broad implications across various scientific and industrial landscapes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dynamical Low-rank Approach for Charged Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.
  For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches.</description>

      <title>High Precision Binding Energies from Physics Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twelve physics informed machine learning models have been trained to model binding energy residuals. Our approach begins with determining the difference between measured experimental binding energies and three different mass models. Then four machine learning approaches are used to train on each energy difference. The most successful ML technique both in interpolation and extrapolation is the least squares boosted ensemble of trees. The best model resulting from that technique utilizes eight physical features to model the difference between experimental atomic binding energy values in AME 2012 and the Duflo Zucker mass model. This resulted in a model that fit the training data with a standard deviation of 17 keV and that has a standard deviation of 92 keV when compared all of the values in the AME 2020. The extrapolation capability of each model is discussed and the accuracy of predicting new mass measurements has also been tested.</description>

Abstract: The free-particle propagator, a key operator in various algorithms for simulating the time evolution of the Schr\"odinger equation, is studied. A multiscale approximation of this propagator is constructed, representing the semigroup associated with the free-particle Schr\"odinger operator in a multiwavelet basis. This representation involves integrals of highly oscillatory functions. These integrals are efficiently discretized using a contour deformation technique, which addresses the challenges posed by earlier discretization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structures is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. In this work, we introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that directly enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI, achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI for band structure interpolation, as further verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Attractors for Singularly Perturbed Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed dynamical systems, commonly known as fast-slow systems, play a crucial role in various applications such as plasma physics. They are closely related to reduced order modeling, closures, and structure-preserving numerical algorithms for multiscale modeling. A powerful and well-known tool to address these systems is the Fenichel normal form, which significantly simplifies fast dynamics near slow manifolds through a transformation. However, the Fenichel normal form is difficult to realize in conventional numerical algorithms. In this work, we explore an alternative way of realizing it through structure-preserving machine learning. Specifically, a fast-slow neural network (FSNN) is proposed for learning data-driven models of singularly perturbed dynamical systems with dissipative fast timescale dynamics. Our method enforces the existence of a trainable, attracting invariant slow manifold as a hard constraint. Closed-form representation of the slow manifold enables efficient integration on the slow time scale and significantly improves prediction accuracy beyond the training data. We demonstrate the FSNN on several examples that exhibit multiple timescales, including the Grad moment system from hydrodynamics, two-scale Lorentz96 equations for modeling atmospheric dynamics, and Abraham-Lorentz dynamics modeling radiation reaction of electrons in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a translationally, rotationally and permutationally symmetry-adapted total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy not only allows for an efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, but also incorporates non-BOA corrections, through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and small molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>FUsion-based ConstitutivE model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling</title>

Abstract: Constitutive modelling is crucial for engineering design and simulations to accurately describe material behavior. However, traditional phenomenological models often struggle to capture the complexities of real materials under varying stress conditions due to their fixed forms and limited parameters. While recent advances in deep learning have addressed some limitations of classical models, purely data-driven methods tend to require large datasets, lack interpretability, and struggle to generalize beyond their training data. To tackle these issues, we introduce "Fusion-based Constitutive model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling". This approach combines established phenomenological models with an ICNN architecture, designed to train on the limited and noisy force-displacement data typically available in practical applications. The hybrid model inherently adheres to necessary constitutive conditions. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout is employed to generate Bayesian predictions, providing mean values and confidence intervals that quantify uncertainty. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness by learning two isotropic constitutive models and one anisotropic model with a single fibre direction, across six different stress states. The framework's applicability is also showcased in finite element simulations across three geometries of varying complexities. Our results highlight the framework's superior extrapolation capabilities, even when trained on limited and noisy data, delivering accurate and physically meaningful predictions across all numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Galaxy Field Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, the ability to generate accurate and large-scale galaxy catalogs is crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe. With the flood of cosmological data from current and upcoming missions, generating theoretical predictions to compare with these observations is essential for constraining key cosmological parameters. While traditional methods, such as the Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD), have provided foundational insights, they struggle to balance the need for both accuracy and computational efficiency. High-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations offer improved precision but are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach that harnesses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Diffusion Models, trained on the CAMELS simulation suite, to bridge the gap between computationally inexpensive dark matter simulations and the galaxy distributions of more costly hydrodynamic simulations. Our method not only outperforms traditional HOD techniques in accuracy but also significantly accelerates the simulation process, offering a scalable solution for next-generation cosmological surveys. This advancement has the potential to revolutionize galaxy catalog generation, enabling more precise, data-driven cosmological analyses.</description>
