      <title>Estimating Vertical Velocity in Convective Updrafts from Temperature, Pressure, and Latent Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical velocity in convective clouds ($w_c$) mediates convective anvil development and global moisture transport, influencing Earth's energy budget, but has yet to be estimated globally over long periods due to the absence of spaceborne retrievals. Here, a method for estimating $w_c$ given vertical profiles of in-cloud temperature, pressure, and latent heating rate is presented and assessed. The method relies on analytical models for the approximately linear relationship between $w_c$ and condensation rate ($\dot{q}_{vc}$) in convective clouds, which we derive from steady-state and non-steady-state plume models. We include in our analysis a version of $\dot{q}_{vc}/w_c$ derived from the supersaturation rate in convective clouds, recently presented in Kukulies et al. (2024). We assess the accuracy of the analytical models against convective cloud simulations run with different model cores and spatial resolutions in both tropical and mid-latitude environments. Differences in accuracies between tropical and mid-latitude environments suggest that this approach for estimating $w_c$ may lead to higher uncertainties in the mid-latitudes, although the estimated velocities are accurate. Despite assumptions in the analytical expressions that theoretically restrict them to liquid water clouds, $w_c$ is estimated to within $\approx2$ m/s of the simulated values at temperatures as low as 240 K. Potential applications, validation against future satellite mission observables, and future approaches for improving the estimation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncoupled high-latitude wave models in COAMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report describes six demonstration cases of two numerical ocean wave models in high latitude regions where waves interact with sea ice. The two wave models are SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) and WW3 (WAVEWATCH III), run in uncoupled mode within the Navy's coupled regional modeling system, COAMPS(R) (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System). The COAMPS software handles a large majority of the tasks associated with the setup, running, and post-processing of the wave models. All six cases are cycling runs with 12-hour increments, each providing a continuous hindcast of four to 26 days duration. SWAN is applied in a Bering Strait case and two Gulf of Bothnia cases. WW3 is applied in a Sea of Okhotsk case and two Barents Sea cases. Verification is performed by visual inspection of model output fields, and by comparing model runs with alternative settings. In the standard configuration, forcing comes from archived global model output, including information on surface wind vectors, sea ice concentration and thickness, and surface current vectors, and the wave model uses a new empirical formula for dissipation of wave energy by sea ice that is dependent on ice thickness. The Barents Sea cases are compared to spectral wave data from satellite (SWIM instrument on CFOSAT) and from motion sensors deployed on the ice by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Experiments are performed with non-standard settings, 1) disabling the dissipation by sea ice, 2) using an older formula for dissipation by sea ice which does not depend on ice thickness, 3) using higher resolution wind and sea ice concentration forcing fields, and 4) omitting surface currents. The impact of these settings on model skill is quantified by comparison to the observations. The skill is also compared to that from a global (thus, lower resolution) ocean wave model.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Shanghai Typhoon Model (ISTM): A generative probabilistic emulator for typhoon hybrid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the systematic underestimation of typhoon intensity in artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models, we propose the Intelligent Shanghai Typhoon Model (ISTM): a unified regional-to-typhoon generative probabilistic forecasting system based on a two-stage UNet-Diffusion framework. ISTM learns a downscaling mapping from 4 years of 25 km ERA5 reanalysis to a 9 km high resolution typhoon reanalysis dataset, enabling the generation of kilometer-scale near-surface variables and maximum radar reflectivity from coarse resolution fields. The evaluation results show that the two-stage UNet-Diffusion model significantly outperforms both ERA5 and the baseline UNet regression in capturing the structure and intensity of surface winds and precipitation. After fine-tuning, ISTM can effectively map AIFS forecasts, an advanced AIWP model, to high-resolution forecasts from AI-physics hybrid Shanghai Typhoon Model, substantially enhancing typhoon intensity predictions while preserving track accuracy. This positions ISTM as an efficient AI emulator of hybrid modeling system, achieving fast and physically consistent downscaling. The proposed framework establishes a unified pathway for the co-evolution of AIWP and physics-based numerical models, advancing next-generation typhoon forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>SODA4: a mesoscale ocean/sea ice reanalysis 1980-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the new Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 4 (SODA4) global eddy-resolving ocean/sea ice reanalysis that spans the 45-year period 1980-2024. The reanalysis is constructed using GFDL MOM5/SIS1 numerics and ECMWF ERA5 forcings with surface and subsurface temperature and salinity observations as constraints within an optimal interpolation data assimilation algorithm. The method of construction and resulting output files are described. Comparison of the SODA4 temperature and salinity fields to observations and to the UK Met Office EN4 temperature and salinity analyses in the upper ocean shows SODA4 has marginal bias and exhibits more regional variability, with less of an imprint of the sparse and inhomogeneous distribution of observations. Comparison of transports across major ocean sections and passages are generally consistent with independent moored observations.</description>

      <title>Learning from nature: insights into GraphDOP's representations of the Earth System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that the GraphDOP model - trained solely on meteorological observations, using no prior knowledge - develops internal representations of the Earth System state, structure and dynamics as well as the characteristics of different observing systems. Firstly, we demonstrate that the network constructs a unified latent representation of the Earth System state which is common across different observation types. For example, cloud structures maintain physical consistency whether viewed in predictions for satellite radiances from different sensors, or for direct in-situ measurements of the cloud fraction. Secondly, we show examples that suggest that the network learns to emulate viewing effects - learned observation operators that map from the unified state representation to observed properties. Microwave sounder limb effects and geometric viewing effects, such as sunglint in visible imagery, are both well captured. Finally, we demonstrate that the model develops rich internal representations of the structure of meteorological systems and their dynamics. For instance, when the network is only provided with observations from a single infrared instrument, it is able to infer unobserved, non-local structures such as jet streams, surface pressure patterns and warm and cold air masses associated with synoptic systems. This work provides insights into how neural networks trained solely on observations of the Earth System spontaneously develop coherent internal representations of the physical world in order to meet the training objective - enhancing our understanding and guiding future development of these models.</description>

      <title>Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>

      <title>Planetary Surface Temperatures from First Principles: Geometric Insights into Energy Balance and Implications for Habitable Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a previously overlooked invariant governing planetary surface temperatures, expressed in terms of only two observables: solar irradiance and Bond albedo. The relation has universal applicability and accurately reproduces the observed climates of rocky planets and large moons with substantial cloud cover (Venus, Earth, Titan), and predicts condensation-level temperatures in the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune). Expressed in its simplest form, the relation encodes global energy conservation and highlights clouds as the primary regulators of planetary climate. The key result is an empirical proportionality between Bond albedo and the fraction of outgoing longwave radiation returned to the surface, termed the inner albedo, capturing the dual role of clouds and hazes as both solar reflectors and thermal mirrors. This proportionality arises naturally from a geometric construction in which surface emission is represented by parabolic cylindrical wavefronts, yielding a universal coefficient linked to the parabolic constant. Extending the framework to exoplanets, we show that it provides first-order predictions of equilibrium surface conditions across the habitable zone, pointing to a geometric necessity that constrains planetary climates beyond the details of atmospheric microphysics.</description>

      <title>Cloud-aerosol interactions in subtropical marine stratocumulus weaken in a warmer climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative effects of aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the most uncertain climate forcing of the Earth system, making it important to understand how they may change with climate. We conduct 3-day-long large-eddy simulations of a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition along an airmass-following trajectory over the Northeast Pacific Ocean. By perturbing boundary layer aerosol concentrations, we simulate aerosol-cloud interactions in both present-day and doubled-CO2 conditions. Aerosol-induced cloud changes, including the Twomey effect and adjustments of cloud fraction and liquid water path, are inhibited in a doubled-CO2 climate. Decomposing the aerosol-induced cloud radiative effect change ($\Delta$CRE) reveals that aerosol-induced cloud fraction changes dominate $\Delta$CRE. Overall, doubling CO2 attenuates aerosol-induced $\Delta$CRE (i.e., cooling) by &gt;30% in our simulations. Our results also show that low cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the background aerosol concentration, highlighting the interplay between climate forcings and feedbacks. These results may aid in predicting the cooling potential of marine cloud brightening in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Local Off-Grid Weather Forecasting with Multi-Modal Earth Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of decaying turbulence beneath surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \hat{\boldsymbol{z}}$ on the beta plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by Bardina et al. (1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parametrizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the "pseudovorticity number" after the pseudovorticity $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>
