      <title>Hierarchical Recurrent Adapters for Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation of Large Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter efficient adaptation methods have become a key mechanism to train large pre-trained models for downstream tasks. However, their per-task parameter overhead is considered still high when the number of downstream tasks to adapt for is large. We introduce an adapter module that has a better efficiency in large scale multi-task adaptation scenario. Our adapter is hierarchical in terms of how the adapter parameters are allocated. The adapter consists of a single shared controller network and multiple task-level adapter heads to reduce the per-task parameter overhead without performance regression on downstream tasks. The adapter is also recurrent so the entire adapter parameters are reused across different layers of the pre-trained model. Our Hierarchical Recurrent Adapter (HRA) outperforms the previous adapter-based approaches as well as full model fine-tuning baseline in both single and multi-task adaptation settings when evaluated on automatic speech recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>3D-Speaker-Toolkit: An Open Source Toolkit for Multi-modal Speaker Verification and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, an open source toolkit for multi-modal speaker verification and diarization. It is designed for the needs of academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The 3D-Speaker-Toolkit adeptly leverages the combined strengths of acoustic, semantic, and visual data, seamlessly fusing these modalities to offer robust speaker recognition capabilities. The acoustic module extracts speaker embeddings from acoustic features, employing both fully-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. The semantic module leverages advanced language models to apprehend the substance and context of spoken language, thereby augmenting the system's proficiency in distinguishing speakers through linguistic patterns. Finally, the visual module applies image processing technologies to scrutinize facial features, which bolsters the precision of speaker diarization in multi-speaker environments. Collectively, these modules empower the 3D-Speaker-Toolkit to attain elevated levels of accuracy and dependability in executing speaker-related tasks, establishing a new benchmark in multi-modal speaker analysis. The 3D-Speaker project also includes a handful of open-sourced state-of-the-art models and a large dataset containing over 10,000 speakers. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/3D-Speaker.</description>

      <title>Non-Exponential Reverberation Modeling Using Dark Velvet Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research on late-reverberation modeling has mainly focused on exponentially decaying room impulse responses, whereas methods for accurately modeling non-exponential reverberation remain challenging. This paper extends the previously proposed basic dark-velvet-noise reverberation algorithm and proposes a parametrization scheme for modeling late reverberation with arbitrary temporal energy decay. Each pulse in the velvet-noise sequence is routed to a single dictionary filter that is selected from a set of filters based on weighted probabilities. The probabilities control the spectral evolution of the late-reverberation model and are optimized to fit a target impulse response via non-negative least-squares optimization. In this way, the frequency-dependent energy decay of a target late-reverberation impulse response can be fitted with mean and maximum T60 errors of 4% and 8%, respectively, requiring about 50% less coloration filters than a previously proposed filtered velvet-noise algorithm. Furthermore, the extended dark-velvet-noise reverberation algorithm allows the modeled impulse response to be gated, the frequency-dependent reverberation time to be modified, and the model's spectral evolution and broadband decay to be decoupled. The proposed method is suitable for the parametric late-reverberation synthesis of various acoustic environments, especially spaces that exhibit a non-exponential energy decay, motivating its use in musical audio and virtual reality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Pathological Speech Quality Assessment with ASR-Powered Wav2Vec2 in Data-Scarce Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment has raised more attention as an alternative or support to traditional perceptual clinical evaluation. However, most research so far only gains good results on simple tasks such as binary classification, largely due to data scarcity. To deal with this challenge, current works tend to segment patients' audio files into many samples to augment the datasets. Nevertheless, this approach has limitations, as it indirectly relates overall audio scores to individual segments. This paper introduces a novel approach where the system learns at the audio level instead of segments despite data scarcity. This paper proposes to use the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 architecture for both SSL, and ASR as feature extractor in speech assessment. Carried out on the HNC dataset, our ASR-driven approach established a new baseline compared with other approaches, obtaining average $MSE=0.73$ and $MSE=1.15$ for the prediction of intelligibility and severity scores respectively, using only 95 training samples. It shows that the ASR based Wav2Vec2 model brings the best results and may indicate a strong correlation between ASR and speech quality assessment. We also measure its ability on variable segment durations and speech content, exploring factors influencing its decision.</description>

      <title>Sound event localization and classification using WASN in Outdoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based sound event localization and classification is an emerging research area within wireless acoustic sensor networks. However, current methods for sound event localization and classification typically rely on a single microphone array, making them susceptible to signal attenuation and environmental noise, which limits their monitoring range. Moreover, methods using multiple microphone arrays often focus solely on source localization, neglecting the aspect of sound event classification. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that employs multiple features and attention mechanisms to estimate the location and class of sound source. We introduce a Soundmap feature to capture spatial information across multiple frequency bands. We also use the Gammatone filter to generate acoustic features more suitable for outdoor environments. Furthermore, we integrate attention mechanisms to learn channel-wise relationships and temporal dependencies within the acoustic features. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments using simulated datasets with different levels of noise and size of monitoring areas, as well as different arrays and source positions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both sound event classification and sound source localization tasks. And we provide further analysis to explain the reasons for the observed errors.</description>

      <title>Voice Signal Processing for Machine Learning. The Case of Speaker Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of automated voice assistants along with other recent technological developments have increased the demand for applications that process audio signals and human voice in particular. Voice recognition tasks are typically performed using artificial intelligence and machine learning models. Even though end-to-end models exist, properly pre-processing the signal can greatly reduce the complexity of the task and allow it to be solved with a simpler ML model and fewer computational resources. However, ML engineers who work on such tasks might not have a background in signal processing which is an entirely different area of expertise.
  The objective of this work is to provide a concise comparative analysis of Fourier and Wavelet transforms that are most commonly used as signal decomposition methods for audio processing tasks. Metrics for evaluating speech intelligibility are also discussed, namely Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), and Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI). The level of detail in the exposition is meant to be sufficient for an ML engineer to make informed decisions when choosing, fine-tuning, and evaluating a decomposition method for a specific ML model. The exposition contains mathematical definitions of the relevant concepts accompanied with intuitive non-mathematical explanations in order to make the text more accessible to engineers without deep expertise in signal processing. Formal mathematical definitions and proofs of theorems are intentionally omitted in order to keep the text concise.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Anchored Contrastive Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) involves detecting the underlying emotion behind each utterance within a conversation. Effectively generating representations for utterances remains a significant challenge in this task. Recent works propose various models to address this issue, but they still struggle with differentiating similar emotions such as excitement and happiness. To alleviate this problem, We propose an Emotion-Anchored Contrastive Learning (EACL) framework that can generate more distinguishable utterance representations for similar emotions. To achieve this, we utilize label encodings as anchors to guide the learning of utterance representations and design an auxiliary loss to ensure the effective separation of anchors for similar emotions. Moreover, an additional adaptation process is proposed to adapt anchors to serve as effective classifiers to improve classification performance. Across extensive experiments, our proposed EACL achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance and exhibits superior performance on similar emotions. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/EACL.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Speech Data Augmentation Methods Using S3PRL Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentations are known to improve robustness in speech-processing tasks. In this study, we summarize and compare different data augmentation strategies using S3PRL toolkit. We explore how HuBERT and wav2vec perform using different augmentation techniques (SpecAugment, Gaussian Noise, Speed Perturbation) for Phoneme Recognition (PR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. We evaluate model performance in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER). From the experiments, we observed that SpecAugment slightly improves the performance of HuBERT and wav2vec on the original dataset. Also, we show that models trained using the Gaussian Noise and Speed Perturbation dataset are more robust when tested with augmented test sets.</description>

      <title>CustomListener: Text-guided Responsive Interaction for User-friendly Listening Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Listening head generation aims to synthesize a non-verbal responsive listener head by modeling the correlation between the speaker and the listener in dynamic conversion.The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving the diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However, they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels, but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity, personality) which can be freely customized by users, this limits their realism. In this paper, we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination, we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP), which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments, we design a Past Guided Generation Module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior, and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation. To train and evaluate our model, we have constructed two text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk, which provide text-video paired labels. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.</description>
