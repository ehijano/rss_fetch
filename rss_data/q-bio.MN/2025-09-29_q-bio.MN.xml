      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in inducible three-gene toggle switch networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes including through gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Two- and three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory processes across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how the conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the bifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying activity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Enhances Language Model Based Cell Embeddings for Low-Sample Single Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.</description>

      <title>Understanding Multistationarity of Fully Open Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses multistationarity of fully open reaction networks equipped with mass action kinetics. We improve upon the existing results relating existence of positive feedback loops in a reaction network and multistationarity; and we provide a novel deterministic operation to generate new non-multistationary networks. This is interesting because while there were many operations to create infinitely many new multistationary networks from a multistationary example, this is the first such operation for the non-multistationary counterpart.
  Such tools for the generation of example networks have a use-case in the application of data science to reaction network theory. We demonstrate this by using the new data, along with a novel graph representation of reaction networks that is unique up to a permutation on the name of species of the network, to train a graph attention neural network model to predict multistationarity of reaction networks. This is the first time machine learning tools are used for studying classification problems of reaction networks.</description>

      <title>QWENDY: Gene Regulatory Network Inference by Quadruple Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is important for understanding various biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present a method, QWENDY, that uses single-cell gene expression data measured at four time points to infer GRNs. Based on a linear gene expression model, it solves the transformation of the covariance matrices. Unlike its predecessor WENDY, QWENDY avoids solving a non-convex optimization problem and produces a unique solution. We test the performance of QWENDY on three experimental data sets and two synthetic data sets. Compared to previously tested methods on the same data sets, QWENDY ranks the first on experimental data, although it does not perform well on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Gillespie Simulation of Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M{\O}D computational framework implements rule-based generative chemistries as explicit transformations of graphs representing chemical structural formulae. Here, we expand M{\O}D by a stochastic simulation module that simulates the time evolution of species concentrations using Gillespie's well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). This module distinguishes itself among competing implementations of rule-based stochastic simulation engines by its flexible network expansion mechanism and its functionality for defining custom reaction rate functions. It enables direct sampling from actual reactions instead of rules. We present methodology and implementation details followed by examples which demonstrate the capabilities of the stochastic simulation engine.</description>

      <title>A Sensitivity Analysis Methodology for Rule-Based Stochastic Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.
  Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.
  Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software M{\O}D for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.</description>
