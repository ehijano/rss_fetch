      <description>arXiv:2601.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the unitarity constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings originating from the $f \bar{f}^\prime \to V V' V''$ channel with $V^{(')('')}=\gamma$, $Z$, $W^\pm$, and $H$. We also assess the importance of these bounds on the present and future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Charting the Flavour Structure of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What flavour structure of $t$-channel thermal dark matter remains compatible with current flavour physics and direct detection bounds? We broadly chart the space of hypotheses using the framework of flavour symmetries and their breaking patterns. We then focus on scenarios in which the fermionic dark matter and its scalar mediator are flavour singlets, falling into the class of rank-1 flavour violation. For two representative benchmarks, quarkphilic ($q_L$) and leptophilic ($e_R$), we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis, fitting the relic abundance and examining the interplay among flavour observables, direct detection, and collider searches. Our results quantify the allowed deviations from flavour-symmetric limits and assess the discovery prospects in future flavour and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Lepton Magnetic Moments: What They Tell Us</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the exciting new Fermilab (FNAL) Muon g-2 measurement impressively confirmed the final Brookhaven (BNL) result from 2004, and with a result four times more precise, has launched a new serious attack on the Standard Model (SM). On the theoretical side, ab initio lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of hadronic vacuum polarization have made remarkable progress. They are now the new standard for studying the leading non-perturbative contributions, which have previously hindered matching with the precision required for full exploitation of the experimental results. The lattice results affected both leading hadronic contributions the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contributions by increasing the previously generally accepted $e^+e^-$ to hadrons based dispersion relation results. The shifts reduced the discrepancy between theory and experiment, leaving nothing missing. One of the most prominent signs of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has disappeared: the SM appears validated more than ever, in agreement with what other searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN tell us! A triumph of the SM, even though the SM cannot explain known cosmological puzzles like dark matter or baryogenesis, and why neutrino masses are so tiny, the absence of strong CP violation, for example. I also argue that the discrepancy between the data-driven dispersive result and the lattice QCD results for the hadronic vacuum polarization can be largely explained by correcting the $e^+e^-$ data for 'rho-gamma' mixing effects.</description>

      <title>Energy and momentum dependence of the soft-axion interaction rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions coupled to thermal non-Abelian gauge fields may have cosmological significance. As the heat bath defines a frame, its influence depends separately on energy and momentum. A light-like momentum ($k \approx \omega$) is relevant for the axion contribution to the effective number of light neutrinos, $\Delta N^{ }_\mathrm{eff}$, whereas a vanishing momentum ($k=0$) plays a role for warm natural inflation or ultralight dark matter, and has been employed in lattice estimates (both classical and quantum-statistical) of the strong sphaleron rate. Focussing on soft energies ($\alpha_\mathrm{s}^{ }T \ll \omega \ll \pi T$), we carry out an HTL computation to show how the domains $k=0$ and $k \approx \omega$ interpolate to each other. We then compare with lattice data at $k=0$, and connect our analysis to NLO computations at $k \approx \omega \ge \pi T$. Assembling the current best input, we re-investigate light QCD axion decoupling dynamics at $T \ge 200$ MeV, showing that efficient interactions in the ultrasoft domain increase $\Delta N^{ }_\mathrm{eff}$ from $\sim 0.03$ to $\sim 0.04$ at $f^{ }_a = 4\times 10^8_{ }$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Study of $CP$ violation in $\Lambda_b^0/\Xi^-_b\rightarrow \Lambda(1520)M$ decays with the final-state rescattering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb collaboration reported the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, with a significance of more than $5\sigma$. This strongly motivates us to investigate the $CP$ violation in more baryon decay processes. In this work, we employ the final-state rescattering mechanism with introducing two model parameters, $\Lambda_{charm}$ and $\Lambda_{charmless}$, and calculate two-body non-leptonic baryon decays $\Lambda^0_b \rightarrow \Lambda(1520)\,\pi^0/\kappa(700)/f_0(500, 980)/\rho^0/K^{*0}/\phi$ and $\Xi^-_b \rightarrow \Lambda(1520)\,K^-$. Consequently, we evaluate the corresponding branching ratios, $CP$ asymmetries, and interference effects between different decay amplitudes. Our theoretical predictions for certain decay channels are in good agreement with current experimental measurements, while the remaining processes--particularly the remarkably large $CP$ violation observable revealed by the kinematic analysis are expected to be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constraint on Residue Phases: Resolving the N(2190) Anomaly and Diagnosing Exotic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a parameter-free geometric constraint on residue phases dictated by the pole-threshold angle. Using the N(2190) anomaly as a test case, this constraint reveals a sign ambiguity in prior data; correcting it yields a phase of $-28^\circ\pm10^\circ$, matching our prediction. This consistency validates the method as a model-independent diagnostic for distinguishing compact from molecular states, offering a rigorous tool for exotic spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Amplitude Pair with Distinct CPV Phases in Charmed Baryon Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a strategy to extract information on the hierarchical amplitude pair in singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) charmed baryon two-body decays, with a dominant amplitude proportional to $\lambda_s = V_{cs}^* V_{us}$ from tree operators and sub-leading one proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^* V_{ub}$ from both penguin and tree contributions. The coexistence of these two amplitudes is essential for generating nonzero CP violation (CPV) effects. Since the $\lambda_b$ amplitude is strongly suppressed, its experimental determination is highly challenging. However, by exploiting SU(3) flavor symmetry, which relates the well-measured Cabibbo-favored (CF) amplitudes to the SCS tree amplitudes, information on the $\lambda_b$ amplitude can be extracted.Using current experimental data, a conservative analysis yields $\lambda_b$ amplitudes can be as large as about $10\%$ of the corresponding tree amplitudes with a significance of $2.1\sigma$. In addition, the Lee-Yang parameters of these decays provide an independent probe of this elusive term. We further identify two golden decay channels, $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$, which are particularly well suited for experimental studies of CPV.</description>

      <title>Hunt for $X(17)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^8Be$ anomaly reported by the Atomki experiments can be explained by the hypothesis of an $X(17)$ boson that interacts with electrons via the ``Vector $\pm$ Axial-vector'' ($V \pm A$) interaction. Using existing experimental data, we derive constraints on the couplings of the $X(17)$ boson to electrons within this $V \pm A$ framework. With this setup, we attempt to identify $X(17)$ signals in the $e^+e^- \longrightarrow X(17) \longrightarrow e^+e^-$ process at the PADME experiment and in the $e^+e^- \longrightarrow X(17)\gamma \longrightarrow e^+e^- \gamma$ process at the BESIII experiment. Our findings indicate that observing the $X(17)$ signal at the PADME experiment is pessimistic, whereas the BESIII experiment may provide a definitive answer regarding the $X(17)$ hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological study of $\Omega_c\rightarrow \Omega^-\pi^+$ at polarized electron-positron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of symmetry laws stands as a cutting-edge direction in modern physics research. This work delves into the examination of P and CP symmetry properties within the charm quark system by analyzing asymmetry parameters in the two-body decay process of $\Omega_c$. By accounting for the polarization effects of electron and positron beams and employing the helicity formalism, we systematically analyze the decay characteristics of $\Omega_c$ and its subsequent hyperon decays through specific asymmetry parameters. A comprehensive formulation of the angular distribution for these decay processes has been developed. The research assesses the detection sensitivity of asymmetry parameters in the $\Omega_c\rightarrow \Omega^-\pi^+$ decay mode across different experimental conditions, including varying data sample sizes and beam polarization configurations. These results contribute to enriching a theoretical foundation for forthcoming experimental endeavors at the STCF, offering significant implications for symmetry studies in the charm sector.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Observable Machine for reinterpretable measurements in high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learning-based framework for constructing generator-level observables optimized for parameter extraction in particle physics analyses is introduced, referred to as the Optimal Observable Machine (OOM). Unfoldable differential distributions are learned that maximize sensitivity to a parameter of interest while remaining robust against detector effects, systematic uncertainties, and biases introduced by the unfolding procedure. Detector response and systematic uncertainties are explicitly incorporated into the training through a likelihood-based loss function, enabling a direct optimization of the expected measurement precision while minimizing the bias from any assumption on the parameter of interest itself. The approach is demonstrated in an application to top quark physics, focusing on the measurement of a recently observed pseudoscalar excess at the top quark pair production threshold in dilepton final states. It is shown that a generator-level observable with enhanced sensitivity and long-term reinterpretability can be constructed using this method.</description>

      <title>Differential observables for the Higgs-strahlung process to all orders in EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods to obtain the fully differential cross-section for the $f \bar{f} \to Z(\ell\ell)\,h$ process to any desired order in effective field theory (EFT). To achieve this, we first derive a mapping between the partial wave expansion and the EFT expansion to all orders. We find that at lower orders, EFT predicts correlations between the different partial wave coefficients. This allows us to construct linear combinations of partial wave coefficients that get their leading contributions from a higher dimension EFT operator. We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process. While we take the Higgs-strahlung process as an example, the methods developed here are completely general and can be applied to other 2-to-2 collider processes.</description>

      <title>Lattice-based equation of state with a critical point from constant entropy contours and its comparison to effective QCD approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically assess the performance of a new method from [H. Shah et al., Phys. Rev. C 113, L012201] for locating the QCD critical point using constant-entropy contours by testing it against various effective QCD approaches. We demonstrate that, while the method yields spurious critical points in purely hadronic models (HRG) due to non-parabolic contour behavior at low temperatures ($T \lesssim 120$ MeV), it accurately reproduces the CP location in frameworks that feature a genuine phase transition and benchmarked against lattice QCD, such as Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, and Functional QCD approaches. Building on our previous determination of constant entropy contours using lattice data, we extend that analysis to construct a complete Lattice-based Equation of State (EoS) at finite density, which features a critical point at $(T, \mu_B) \approx (114, 602)$ MeV. By integrating the extrapolated entropy density with respect to temperature, we reconstruct the pressure, baryon density, susceptibility, and speed of sound in the critical region, and analyze the focusing behavior of isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the critical point.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Complexity of String Breaking in the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.</description>

      <title>New CDM Crisis Revealed by Multi-Scale Cluster Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of substructure in galaxy clusters, exquisitely probed by gravitational lensing, offer a stringent test of dark matter models. Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $\gamma \gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \lesssim 0.01\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>Merging multidimensional equations of state of strongly interacting matter via a statistical mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method to merge multidimensional equations of state (EoSs) by combining them in a two-fluid equilibrium statistical mixture in the grand canonical ensemble. The merged grand potential density $\omega$ is built directly from the input EoSs and the fluid fractions are fixed by minimizing $\omega$ at fixed temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$. Thermodynamic consistency and stability are guaranteed as all thermodynamic quantities are consistently derived from a single merged grand potential $\omega(T,\mu_B)$ with the correct convexity properties. Our method can accommodate a first-order phase transition and a critical endpoint with mean-field critical exponents. We use this method to merge a van der Waals Hadron-Resonance-Gas EoS with a holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton EoS that has a critical point and a first-order line. The result is a single EoS, spanning hadronic and deconfined matter over a broad range in $(T,\mu_B)$, which can be readily used in heavy-ion hydrodynamic simulations. Our merging method can be generalized to consider a higher dimensional phase diagram (e.g., by considering more chemical potentials) and more than two input EoSs.</description>

      <title>Excluding Hypothetical Light Boson Interpretation of Yb King Plot Nonlinearity with the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ Isotope Shift Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present precision spectroscopy and isotope shift measurement of the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ clock transition in neutral ytterbium ($\mathrm{Yb}$) atoms. By revealing a magic wavelength at $905.4(2)$ nm, we successfully achieve the atomic spectrum narrower than $100$ Hz. The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements. This work paves the way for the effective use of precision isotope shift data in the King plot analysis and stimulates further measurements in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and other elements.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Scalar Backreaction in Axion-SU(2) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform the first numerical study of strong scalar backreaction in spectator chromo-natural inflation (SCNI) in the case where the spectator sector decays during inflation. The tachyonic instability in scalar fluctuations, activated as the system crosses the $m_Q = \sqrt{2}$ threshold, amplifies perturbations and may significantly alter the background dynamics. The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay. We describe the dynamics of such decay and derive the gravitational wave spectrum for a set of benchmark parameters. Interestingly, the signal may peak at interferometer scales and lie within LISA's projected sensitivity.</description>

      <title>On equivalent methods for functional determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.</description>

      <title>QCD phase-transition under the light of Thermofractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\beta$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\langle L \rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\sigma^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\langle L \rangle \propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \langle L \rangle \propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.</description>

      <title>Search for Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter with the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter (CReDM) using the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data of the CDEX-10 experiment located at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The cosmic ray electron spectrum and distribution in the Galaxy are generated by the $\tt GALPROP$ code package. In the calculation process of DM-electron scattering process in the Galaxy, we consider the energy-dependency of the DM-electron scattering cross section. The constraints on CReDM are set for both heavy and light mediator scenarios using the CDEX-10 dataset. The result exceeds previous Standard Halo Model (SHM) limits for DM mass lower than 0.6 MeV in heavy mediator case and corresponds to the best sensitivity among all direct detection experiments from 1 keV to 0.5 MeV in the light mediator scenario.</description>

      <title>The influence of the scalar unparticle and polarization on the exclusive W boson hadronic decays in the final state at muon colliders in the Randall-Sundrum model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10025v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attempt is made to present the effect of unparticle physics and polarization on the exclusive decays of W boson at high energy colliders in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. By using Feynman diagram techniques we have evaluated the influence of the scalar unparticle and polarization on the exclusive W boson hadronic decays of $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{\pm}\gamma$ and $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \rho^{\pm}\gamma$ at the high energy muon colliders in the RS model. The result shows that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-section for hadronic productions in the final state depends strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarizes. With a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV, the total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when the benchmark signal point as $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 \text{TeV}, 1.9)$ and the polarization coefficient as $(P_{\mu^{-}}, P_{\mu^{+}} )= (1,1)$. The numerical evaluation for the statistical significance is given in detail which indicates that the effect is greatly enhanced in the future experiments with moderately high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a fading window: electroweak baryogenesis in the C2HDM, LHC constraints after Run 2 and prospects for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe remains one of the most pressing open questions in particle physics and cosmology. Electroweak baryogenesis offers an experimentally testable explanation, requiring new sources of CP violation and a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. The Two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is the simplest scalar extension of the Standard Model that can accommodate both ingredients. We critically assess the viability of the complex 2HDM (C2HDM) (a 2HDM with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and a single source of explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector) as a framework for electroweak baryogenesis, incorporating for the first time a comprehensive set of LHC Run 2 results at 13 TeV. By defining CP-violating benchmark planes tailored for a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, we identify regions of parameter space motivated by electroweak baryogenesis that will be testable at the LHC, and at future space-based gravitational wave experiments. The benchmark planes are intended to guide ongoing efforts in defining representative scenarios for the exploration of CP-violation in extended scalar sectors at the LHC Run 3 and beyond, while also assessing the emerging synergy between the LHC and future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. We also quantify the current tension between the realisation of electroweak baryogenesis and the non-observation of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), finding that the predicted electron EDMs typically exceed the experimental limits by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Could a Primordial Black Hole Explosion Explain the extremely high-energy KM3NeT neutrino Event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $\sim 220$~PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. If the event originated from a PBH, the source would need to lie at $(1-7)\times 10^{-5} \mathrm{pc}$ - depending on the assumed effective area - thus within the Solar System. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube and KM3NeT \textit{itself} should likewise have detected of order a few hundred events in the range $1~\mathrm{TeV} \lesssim E_\nu \lesssim 1~\mathrm{PeV}$ during the 24 hours preceding the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.</description>

Abstract: We compute the coefficients $c_2(T,B)$ and $c_4(T,B)$ of the Taylor expansion for the pressure in powers of $\mu_B/T$ in the presence of a large magnetic field within perturbative QCD at finite temperature and baryon density up to two-loops for $N_f=3$ flavors with physical quark masses. We also present results for the excess of pressure, baryon density and baryon number susceptibility as functions of $\mu_B$, as well as susceptibilities as functions of the temperature in the $\{ \mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S \}$ basis. Our results can be directly compared to recent lattice QCD data. Even though current lattice results do not overlap with its region of validity, perturbative results seem to be compatible with those obtained on the lattice for large temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Precise predictions for Higgs decays are a crucial ingredient of the search for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a valuable tool for quantifying deviations from the Standard Model (SM). We present the complete set of predictions for the 2- and 3- body Higgs decays at next-to-leading order (NLO), considering QCD and electroweak corrections and including all contributions from the dimension-6 SMEFT operators and with an arbitrary flavor structure. Including the NLO SMEFT results for Higgs decays greatly increases the sensitivity to BSM physics of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow Zh$ process at FCC-ee, as compared with that obtained using only the total cross section.</description>

Abstract: We present integrated subtraction terms and finite remainders for arbitrary processes with massless partons at hadron and lepton colliders in the context of the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme. These results provide the very last ingredients needed to make this scheme a fully local, analytic and process-independent framework for treating infrared singularities at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. The explicit infrared finiteness of all required contributions, as well as their process-independence, puts these results on par with subtraction schemes developed for next-to-leading order computations and opens up a clear path towards the automation of next-to-next-to-leading order computations in QCD.</description>

Abstract: We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Lindblad-driven recombination of the X(3872) tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure of the exotic meson X(3872) remains an open question. We investigate its production in heavy-ion collisions under the hypothesis that it is a compact tetraquark. To this end, we derive a coalescence model from the Lindblad equation, assuming that unbound heavy quarks are thermalized within the quark-gluon plasma and that the adiabatic approximation holds. Using this model, we predict the nuclear modification factor of the X(3872) at LHC energies, with proton-proton baseline cross sections estimated from available experimental data. We also consider the effect of simplifying assumptions on the model, and a complementary approach based on chemical equilibration. Our results indicate that recombination is the dominant production mechanism for a tetraquark X(3872). It leads to a significant yield enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting that the nuclear modification factor is a powerful observable for probing the exotic nature of this state</description>

      <title>Angular correlation and deformed Hellings-Downs curve from spin-2 ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pulsar timings are sensitive to both the nanohertz gravitational-wave background and the oscillation of ultralight dark matter. The Hellings-Downs angular correlation curve provides a criterion to search for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds at nanohertz via pulsar timing arrays. We study the angular correlation of the timing residuals induced by the spin-2 ultralight dark matter, which is different from the usual Hellings-Downs correlation. At a typical frequency, we show that the spin-2 ultralight dark matter can give rise to the deformation of the Hellings-Downs correlation curve induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strong isovector nuclear spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleon spin-orbit interaction is a cornerstone of nuclear structure theory, yet its isospin dependence remains elusive owing to the lack of clean experimental probes. Here we show that the charge-weak form factor difference in $^{48}$Ca, recently extracted in a model-independent manner by the CREX experiment, exhibits strong sensitivity to the isovector spin-orbit interaction. Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Star Properties from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to constrain NS radii with uncertainties as small as $\sigma \simeq 0.1$~km. Such unprecedented precision offers a unique opportunity to extract new information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Using mock radius data with uncertainties ranging from $\sigma = 1.0$ to $0.1$~km, together with a flexible meta-model NS EOS that allows for a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we perform a Bayesian statistical analysis to assess the impact of radius measurements on EOS constraints. We find that high-precision radius measurements, particularly for massive NSs, significantly tighten constraints on the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, the quark matter mass fraction in NS cores, and several parameters characterizing the EOS of supranuclear hadronic matter, although the degree of improvement depends on the assumed prior range of $\rho_t$. In contrast, even with the highest precision considered, NS radii -- including those of massive stars -- remain largely insensitive to the stiffness of quark matter, independent of the measurement accuracy or the prior range adopted for $\rho_t$.</description>

      <title>Chasing Serendipity: Tackling Transient Sources with Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain an open question. With the observation of several neutrino events with energies about the PeV, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We present a framework to account for the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble.
  Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>
