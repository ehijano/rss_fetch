      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>

      <title>Physical quantities as a partially additive field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of a field by allowing addition to be a partial operation. We show that elements of such a "partially additive field" share many similarities with physical quantities. In particular, they form subsets of mutually summable elements (similar to physical dimensions), dimensionless elements (those summable with 1) form a field, and every element can be uniquely represented as a product of a dimensionless element and any non-zero element of the same dimension (a unit). We also discuss the conditions for the existence of a coherent unit system. In contrast to previous works, our axiomatization encompasses quantities, values, units, and dimensions in a single algebraic structure, illustrating that partial operations may provide a more elegant description of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>
