      <title>Human Ancestries Simulation and Inference: a Review of Ancestral Recombination Graph Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is little debate about the importance of the ancestral recombination graph in population genetics. An important theoretical tool, the main obstacle to its widespread usage is the computational cost required to match the ever-increasing scale of the data being analyzed. Many of these difficulties have been overcome in the past two decades, which have consequently seen the development of increasingly sophisticated ARG simulation and inference software. Nonetheless, challenges remain, especially in the area of ancestry inference. This paper is a comprehensive review of ARG samplers that have emerged in the past three decades to meet the need for scalable and flexible ancestry simulation and inference solutions. It specifically focuses on their performance, usability, and the biological realism of the underlying algorithm, and aims primarily to provide a technical overview of the field for researchers seeking to write their own coalescent-with-recombination sampler. As a complement to this article, we have compiled links to software, source code and documentation and made them available at https://www.patrickfournier.ca/arg-samplers-review/graph.</description>

      <title>Fisher's fundamental theorem and regression in causal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fisher's fundamental theorem describes the change caused by natural selection as the change in gene frequencies multiplied by the partial regression coefficients for the average effects of genes on fitness. Fisher's result has generated extensive controversy in biology. I show that the theorem is a simple example of a general partition for change in regression predictions across altered contexts. By that rule, the total change in a mean response is the sum of two terms. The first ascribes change to the difference in predictor variables, holding constant the regression coefficients. The second ascribes change to altered context, captured by shifts in the regression coefficients. This general result follows immediately from the product rule for finite differences applied to a regression equation. Economics widely applies this same partition, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, as a fundamental tool that can in proper situations be used for causal analysis. Recognizing the underlying mathematical generality clarifies Fisher's theorem, provides a useful tool for causal analysis, and reveals connections across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Gene genealogies in haploid populations evolving according to sweepstakes reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sweepstakes reproduction may be generated by chance matching of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions. Gene genealogies generated by sweepstakes reproduction are in the domain of attraction of multiple-merger coalescents where a random number of lineages merges at such times. We consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction for haploid panmictic populations of both constant ($N$), and varying population size, and evolving in a random environment. We construct our models so that we can recover the observed number of new mutations in a given sample without requiring strong assumptions regarding the population size or the mutation rate. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time coalescents that are either the Kingman coalescent or specific families of Beta- or Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents; when combining the results the parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from 0 to 2, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring an arbitrary individual may produce; {\it (ii)} in large populations we measure time in units proportional to either $ N/\log N$ or $N$ generations; {\it (iii)} incorporating fluctuations in population size leads to time-changed multiple-merger coalescents where the time-change does not depend on $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that in some cases approximations of functionals of a given coalescent do not match the ones of the ancestral process in the domain of attraction of the given coalescent; {\it (v)} approximations of functionals obtained by conditioning on the population ancestry (the ancestral relations of all gene copies at all times) are broadly similar (for the models considered here) to the approximations obtained without conditioning on the population ancestry.</description>

      <title>geohabnet: An R package for mapping habitat connectivity for biosecurity and conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping habitat suitability, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat suitability may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat suitability may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.
  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat suitability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.
  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.
  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of an age-structured and spatially resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulation model. This combined approach complements classical modeling approaches which are mostly mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a spatial graph with 400 nodes representing German counties. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across horizons of 30-90 day simulation and prediction, allowing up to three contact change points, the surrogate model attains 10-27 \% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</description>
