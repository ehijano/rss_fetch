      <title>Sub-Doppler spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms via velocity selection memory in a hot vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study resonance redistribution mechanisms inside a hot vapor cell. This is achieved by pumping atoms on the first cesium resonance, 6S1/2--&gt;6P1/2, and subsequently probing the velocity distribution of the 6P1/2 population by a linear absorption experiment on the 6P1/2--&gt;16S1/2 or 6P1/2--&gt;15D3/2 transitions at 514 nm and 512 nm respectively. We demonstrate that despite the existence of thermalization processes, traces of the initial velocity selection, imposed by the pump, survive in both hyperfine levels of the intermediate (6P1/2) state. This observation, allows us to perform sub-Doppler resolution vapor cell spectroscopy on Rydberg states using a simple pump-probe setup. At high cesium densities, redistribution mechanisms dominate, and the velocity selection vanishes. However, spectral analysis provides information on the collisional shifts and broadenings of the probed Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements of muonium and muonic helium hyperfine structure at J-PARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the J-PARC Muon Science Facility (MUSE), the MuSEUM collaboration is now performing new precision measurements of the ground state hyperfine structure (HFS) of both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-precision measurements of the muonium ground-state HFS are recognized as one of the most sensitive tools for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory to precisely probe the standard model and determine fundamental constants of the positive muon magnetic moment and mass. The same technique can also be employed to measure muonic helium HFS, obtain the negative muon magnetic moment and mass, and test and improve the theory of the three-body atomic system. Measurements at zero magnetic field have already yielded more accurate results than previous experiments for both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-field measurements are now ready to start collecting data using the world's most intense pulsed muon beam at the MUSE H-line. We aim to improve the precision of previous measurements ten times for muonium and a hundred times or more for muonic helium. We review all the key developments for these new measurements, focusing on the high-field experiment, and report the latest results and prospects.</description>

      <title>Two-electron one-photon process in collision of 1.8-2.1 MeV neon on aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray emissions due to the two-electron one-photon (TEOP) process in the neon projectile and aluminum target have been successfully observed for the beam energy window of 1.8-2.1 MeV. Experimental TEOP transition energies have been compared with theoretical predictions of flexible atomic structure code (FAC) and General-purpose Relativistic Atomic Structure (GRASP) package. Present results have been verified with reported theoretical and experimental values. Transition rates of the TEOP transitions have also been studied using the said codes. The observed lines have been assigned when the measured transition energies are in good agreement with the theoretical values. Such assignments have further been validated with the good agreements between the experimental and theoretical transition rates. Note that only the TEOP lines in projectile ions are seen with 1.8 MeV energy. In contrast, the TEOP lines in target ions are also observed well with 2.1 MeV energy. Thus, this study sheds useful light on the excitation mechanism of the TEOP processes in the low energy regimes.</description>

      <title>Metrology in a two-electron atom: The ionization energy of metastable triplet helium ($\mathbf{2\,^3S}_\mathbf{1}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium (He) is the ideal atom to perform tests of ab-initio calculations in two-electron systems that consider all known effects, including quantum-electrodynamics and nuclear-size contributions. Recent state-of-the-art calculations and measurements of energy intervals involving the He $2\;^3S_1$ metastable state reveal discrepancies at the level of $7\,\sigma$ that require clarification both from the experimental and theoretical sides. We report on a new determination, with unprecedented accuracy, of the ionization energy $E_\mathrm{I}\,(2\;^3S_1)$ of the $(1s)(2s)\;^3S_1$ metastable state of He. The measurements rely on a new approach combining interferometric laser-alignment control, SI-traceable frequency calibration and imaging-assisted Doppler-free spectroscopy. With this approach we record spectra of the $np$ Rydberg series in a highly-collimated cold supersonic beam of metastable He generated by a cryogenic valve and an electric discharge. Extrapolation of the Rydberg series yields a new value of the ionization energy ($E_\mathrm{I}\,(2\;^3S_1)/h= 1\,152\,842\,742.7082(55)_\mathrm{stat}(25)_\mathrm{sys}\,\mathrm{MHz}$) that deviates by $9\,\sigma$ from the most precise theoretical result ($1\,152\,842\,742.231(52)\;\mathrm{MHz}$), reported by Patk\'o\v{s}, Yerokhin and Pachucki [Phys. Rev. A. 103, 042809 (2021)], confirming earlier discrepancies between experiment and theory in this fundamental system.</description>

      <title>Combining laser cooling and Zeeman deceleration for precision spectroscopy in supersonic beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopic measurements in atoms and molecules play an increasingly important role in chemistry and physics, e.g., to characterize structure and dynamics at long timescales, to determine physical constants, or to search for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. In this article, we demonstrate the combination of Zeeman deceleration and transverse laser cooling to generate slow (mean velocity of 175 m/s) and transversely ultracold ($T_\perp \approx 135 \,\mu$K) supersonic beams of metastable $(1s)(2s)\,^3S_1$ He (He$^*$) for precision spectroscopy. The curved-wavefront laser-cooling approach is used to achieve large capture velocities and high He$^*$ number densities. The beam properties are characterized by imaging, time-of-flight and high-resolution spectroscopic methods, and the factors limiting the Doppler widths in single-photon spectroscopic measurements of the $(1 s)(40 p) \,^3 P_J \, \leftarrow (1 s)(2 s) \,^3 S_1$ transition at UV frequencies around $1.15\times 10^{15}$ Hz are analyzed. In particular, the use of skimmers to geometrically confine the beam in the transverse directions is examined and shown to not always lead to a reduction of the Doppler width. Linewidths as narrow as 5 MHz could be obtained, enabling the determination of line centers with a precision of $\Delta \nu/\nu$ of $4\times 10^{-11}$ limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. Numerical particle-trajectory simulations are used to interpret the experimental observations and validate the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Double-$K$-hole resonances in single photoionization of He-like B$^{3+}$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a joint experimental and theoretical research project, single photoionization of He-like B$^{3+}$ ions was investigated in the energy range from approximately 250 to 1200~eV. With the parent-ion beam in the experiment containing both $1s^2~^1S$ ground-state and $1s2s~^3S$ metastable B$^{3+}$ ions, double-core-hole resonances could be studied. Two series of hollow resonant states were observed, one populated by $K$-shell double excitation $1s^2~^1S \to 2\ell n\ell'~^1P$ ($\ell=s,p$; $\ell'=p,s$; $n=2,3,..,6$) at photon energies up to about 510~eV, the other by $K$-shell single excitation $1s2s~^3S \to 2\ell n\ell'~^3P$ ($\ell=s,p$; $\ell'=p,s$; $n=2,3,..,6$) at energies up to about 310~eV. High resolving powers up to approximately 29000 were achieved. The relativistic many-body perturbation theory was employed to determine level-to-level cross sections for $K$-shell excitation with subsequent autoionization. The resonance energies were calculated with inclusion of electron correlation and radiative contributions. The energy uncertainties of the most prominent resonances are estimated to be below $\pm 1$ meV. Convergent close coupling (CCC) calculations provided single-photoionization cross sections $\sigma_{34}$ for B$^{3+}$ including the resonant and non-resonant channels. Apart from the resonances, $\sigma_{34}$ is dominated by direct ionization in the investigated energy range. The contribution $\sigma_{34}^{\mathrm{dir}}$ of the latter process to $\sigma_{34}$ was separately determined by using the random-phase approximation with exchange and relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations which agree very well with previous calculations. Direct ionization of one electron accompanied by excitation of the remaining electron was treated by the CCC theory and found to be a minor contribution to $\sigma_{34}$.</description>

      <title>Phase-contrast imaging of a dense atomic cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental production and characterization of a dense cold atomic cloud of \(^{88}\text{Sr}\) atoms, optimized for the future studies of light transport in highly dense regimes. Using narrow-line molasses on the 689 nm transition, combined with a far off-resonant optical dipole trap, we achieve spatial densities as high as \(7.9 \times 10^{13} \, \text{atoms/cm}^3\) and optical depths up to 64. This approach stands out from previous methods by integrating narrow-line molasses with an optical dipole trap, enabling high-density samples without relying on evaporative cooling. Unlike traditional absorption imaging, which becomes inaccurate in such dense regimes, we demonstrate that phase-contrast imaging (PCI) can reliably reconstruct the in-situ density profile even for highly spatially and optically dense samples. The use of a spatial light modulator instead of a fixed phase plate in the PCI setup provides enhanced flexibility and control of imaging parameters, making this imaging technique robust against imaging artifacts and adaptable to varying experimental conditions. Moreover, we derive theoretical conditions for reliable PCI operation in dense regimes and validate these experimentally, showing excellent agreement with time-of-flight measurements even at the highest densities. Our results establish a robust method for producing and characterizing dense atomic clouds.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Atom-by-Atom Assembly of Defect-Free Two-Dimensional Mixed-Species Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect-free single atom array in optical tweezers is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.083202}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083202(2022)}}], the filling fractions were limited by the imperfect transfer of atoms and the occurrence of logjams during the atom rearrangement. In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Modeling the time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging of halomethane photodissociation with \textit{ab initio} potential energy curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective theoretical model to simulate observables in time-resolved two-fragment Coulomb explosion experiments. The model employs the potential energy curves of the neutral molecule and the doubly charged cation along a predefined reaction coordinate to simulate the photodissociation process followed by Coulomb explosion. We compare our theoretical predictions with pump-probe experiments on iodomethane and bromoiodomethane. Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to $\text{I}(^2\text{P}_{3/2})$ and $\text{I}^*(^2\text{P}_{1/2})$ products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump-probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results. Furthermore, our theory confirms that two-fragment Coulomb explosion imaging cannot resolve different spin channels in bromoiodomethane photodissociation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Electromagnetically Induced Transparency based Cold Atomic Engines using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an artificial neural network model to predict quantum heat engines working within the experimentally realized framework of electromagnetically induced transparency. We specifically focus on {\Lambda}-type alkali-based cold atomic systems. This network allows us to analyze all the alkali atom-based engines' performance. High performance engines are predicted and analyzed based on three figures of merit output, radiation temperature, work and ergotropy. Contrary to traditional notion, the algorithm reveal the limitations of output radiation temperature as a stand alone metric for enhanced engine performance. In high output temperature regime, Cs based engine with a higher output temperature than Rb based engine is characterized by lower work and ergotropy. This is found to be true for different atomic engines with common predicted states in both high and low output temperature regimes. Additionally, the ergotropy is found to exhibit a saturating exponential dependency on the control Rabi frequency.</description>

      <title>Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.</description>

Abstract: We report the preparation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by integrating laser cooling with a grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT) and forced evaporation in a magnetic trap on a single chip. This new approach allowed us to produce a $6 \times 10^4$ atom Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms with a single laser cooling beam. Our results represent a significant advance in the robustness and reliability of cold atom-based inertial sensors, especially for applications in demanding field environments.</description>

      <title>Multiple ionization, fragmentation and dehydrogenation of coronene in collision with swift proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coronene molecules have been bombarded by protons of energy by 75 to 300 keV. The time of flight mass spectrum has been recorded using a two stage Wiley McLaren type spectrometer. A large enhancement in the doubly and triply ionized recoil ion is observed compared to the singly ionized one. The single, double and triple ionization yields have also been calculated using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW EIS) theoretical model and are compared with the experimental results. Experimental double to single ionization yield ratios and triple to single ionization yield ratios have been compared with the theoretical ratios which are found to be much higher w.r. t. the gas atoms. Evaporation peaks due to the loss of several neutral C2H2 and C3H3 are observed corresponding to their parent singly, doubly and triply charge coronene ions. Small fragmentation peaks CnHx+ (n = 3 to 7) are present in the spectra due to higher energy transfer by the projectile to the molecule. The hydrogen losses are observed in the cation, di-cation and tri-cation coronene peak structures. A maximum of the 7 H losses are detected which depends on the beam energy.</description>

      <title>Observing Quantum Coherent Oscillations in a Three-Level Atoms via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency by Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has high spectral resolution and is a useful tool for studying atom dynamics. In this paper, we show a smallest unit of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for 2DES, that is, a three-level system. It is found that the original main peak is split into four small ones due to the introduction of the EIT. It suggests that the homogeneous broadening of 2DES can be effectively reduced by the EIT. Moreover, in sharp contrast to a constant height, the height of the peaks will manifest a damped oscillation with respect to the population time. It seems that the quantum-beat phenomenon appears. These findings may help us obtain more information about the dynamics of excited states.</description>

      <title>Generation and optimization of entanglement between atoms chirally coupled to spin cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generation and optimization of entanglement between atoms chirally coupled to finite 1D spin chains, functioning as {\it spin cavities}. By diagonalizing the spin cavity Hamiltonian, we identify a parity effect that influences entanglement, with small even-sized cavities chirally coupled to atoms expediting entanglement generation by approximately $50\%$ faster than non-chiral coupling. Applying a classical driving field to the atoms reveals oscillations in concurrence, with resonant dips at specific driving strengths due to the resonances between the driven atom and the spin cavity. Extending our study to systems with energetic disorder, we find that high concurrence can be achieved regardless of disorder strength when the inverse participation ratio of the resulting eigenstates is favorable. Finally, we demonstrate that controlled disorder within the cavity significantly enhances and expedites entanglement generation, achieving higher concurrences up to four times faster than those attained in ordered systems.</description>
