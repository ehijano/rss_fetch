      <title>A genetic algorithm for the response of twisted nematic liquid crystals to an applied field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an external field is applied across a liquid-crystal cell, the twist and tilt distributions cannot be calculated analytically and must be extracted numerically. In the standard approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived from the minimization of the free energy of the system and then solved via finite-difference methods, often implemented in commercial software. These tools iterate from initial solutions that are compatible with the boundary conditions, providing limited to no flexibility for customization. Here, we present a genetic algorithm that outputs fast and accurate solutions to the integral form of the equations. In our approach, the evolutionary routine is sequentially applied at each position within the bulk of the cell, thus overcoming the necessity of assuming trial solutions. The predictions of our routine strongly support the experimental observations on different instances of spatially varying twisted nematic liquid-crystal cells, patterned with different topologies on the two alignment layers.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} calculations of photocurrent in solids based on Wannier function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general \textit{ab initio} method based on Wannier function for simulating the photocurrent in solids. The method is widely applicable to charge/spin DC and AC photocurrent at any perturbation levels in both semiconductors and metals for both linearly and circularly polarized light. This is because the method is theoretically complete (within relaxation time approximation), that is to say, it includes all intra-band, inter-band and their cross terms. Specifically for the second-order DC photocurrent, it includes all of the following contributions - shift current, (magnetic) injection current, Berry curvature dipole, gyration current and Fermi surface ones, instead of only a part of them as in most previous \textit{ab initio} methods. It is also free from the degeneracy issue, i.e., applicable to arbitrary band structures with arbitrary numbers of degenerate bands. We apply the method to various semiconductors and metals, including GaAs, graphene-hBN heterostructure, monolayer WS$_{2}$, a 2D ferroelectric material - monolayer GeS, bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and topological Weyl semimetal RhSi to simulate their charge and/or spin, DC and/or AC photocurrent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with previous theoretical works. Our method provides a universal computational tool for reliable and accurate predictions of abundant weak-field photocurrent phenomena in disparate materials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of warm dense two-component systems without fixed nodes: structural properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for a variety of structural properties of warm dense hydrogen and beryllium. To deal with the fermion sign problem -- an exponential computational bottleneck due to the antisymmetry of the electronic thermal density matrix -- we employ the recently proposed [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022); \textbf{159}, 164113 (2023)] $\xi$-extrapolation method and find excellent agreement with exact direct PIMC reference data where available. This opens up the intriguing possibility to study a gamut of properties of light elements and potentially material mixtures over a substantial part of the warm dense matter regime, with direct relevance for astrophysics, material science, and inertial confinement fusion research.</description>

      <title>A generalized hybrid method for surfactant dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized hybrid method for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) surfactant dynamics. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the Eulerian method, the surfactant transport is tracked by a Lagrangian particle method, in which the remeshing technique is employed to prevent particle clustering. For the mass redistribution during remeshing, the redistribution weight is selected with weighted least squares, which shares the theoretical basis of the moving least squares method (MLS) and enables the present hybrid method to work in both 2-D and 3-D cases. This optimized mass redistribution effectively strengthens the robustness of the present hybrid method, as validated by 2-D topological changes of the dumbbell. The conservation, accuracy, and convergence of the present hybrid method have also been validated with both 2-D and 3-D test cases, including a translation circle/sphere, a deformed circle/sphere in the shear flow, and droplet deformation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating fourth-generation machine learning potentials by quasi-linear scaling particle mesh charge equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) have revolutionized the field of atomistic simulations by describing the atomic interactions with the accuracy of electronic structure methods at a small fraction of the costs. Most current MLPs construct the energy of a system as a sum of atomic energies, which depend on information about the atomic environments provided in form of predefined or learnable feature vectors. If, in addition, non-local phenomena like long-range charge transfer are important, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which include a charge equilibration (Qeq) step to take the global structure of the system into account. This Qeq can significantly increase the computational cost and thus can become the computational bottleneck for large systems. In this paper we present a highly efficient formulation of Qeq that does not require the explicit computation of the Coulomb matrix elements resulting in a quasi-linearly scaling method. Moreover, our approach also allows for the efficient calculation of energy derivatives, which explicitly consider the global structure-dependence of the atomic charges as obtained from Qeq. Due to its generality, the method is not restricted to MLPs but can also be applied within a variety of other force fields.</description>

      <title>Advancing parabolic operators in thermodynamic MHD models II: Evaluating a Practical Time Step Limit for Unconditionally Stable Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconditionally stable time stepping schemes are useful and often practically necessary for advancing parabolic operators in multi-scale systems. However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Prediction of Low-Energy Experimental Photoelectron Spectra of Al$_n$Ni$^{-}$ Clusters (n=1-13)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context Mixed-metal clusters have long been studied because of their peculiar properties and how they change with cluster size, composition and charge state and their potential roles in catalysis. The characterization of these clusters is therefore a very important issue. One of the main experimental tools for characterizing their electronic structure is photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical computation completes the task by fully determining the structural properties and matching the theoretical predictions to the measured spectra. We present density functional theory computations of the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of negatively charged mixed Al$_{n}$Ni$^{-}$ clusters with up to 13 Al atoms. The lowest energy structures of the anionic clusters with up to 7 atoms are also found to be low energy isomers of the neutral counterparts found in the literature. The 13-atom cluster is found to be a quartet and a perfect icosahedron. The predicted photoelectron spectra are also presented and can be used to interpret future experimental data. We also presented indicators that can be used to determine the potential of these systems for single atom catalysis. These indicators point to smaller clusters to be more reactive as the gap between the Fermi energy and the center of the d-band increases with cluster size and that Ni occupy and internal site for n=11-13. We speculate that reactivity can be enhanced if one adds an additional Ni atom. Methods The DFT calculations were performed using the Becke exchange and Perdew-Wang/91 correlation functionals (BPW91), a DFT-optimized all-electron basis set for the aluminum atom and the Stuttgart small core pseudopotential for the Ni atom. All of the computations used the Gaussian 03 software.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <title>Active Deep Kernel Learning of Molecular Functionalities: Realizing Dynamic Structural Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring molecular spaces is crucial for advancing our understanding of chemical properties and reactions, leading to groundbreaking innovations in materials science, medicine, and energy. This paper explores an approach for active learning in molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), a novel approach surpassing the limits of classical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Employing the QM9 dataset, we contrast DKL with traditional VAEs, which analyze molecular structures based on similarity, revealing limitations due to sparse regularities in latent spaces. DKL, however, offers a more holistic perspective by correlating structure with properties, creating latent spaces that prioritize molecular functionality. This is achieved by recalculating embedding vectors iteratively, aligning with the experimental availability of target properties. The resulting latent spaces are not only better organized but also exhibit unique characteristics such as concentrated maxima representing molecular functionalities and a correlation between predictive uncertainty and error. Additionally, the formation of exclusion regions around certain compounds indicates unexplored areas with potential for groundbreaking functionalities. This study underscores DKL's potential in molecular research, offering new avenues for understanding and discovering molecular functionalities beyond classical VAE limitations.</description>

      <title>Impact of wavefront shape on nonlinear ultrasound imaging of monodisperse microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) combines nonlinear, resonant microbubbles (MBs) with dedicated pulse sequences to reveal the vascular function of organs. Clinical ultrasound contrast agents consist of polydisperse MB suspensions with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 10 um and resonance frequencies ranging from 1 to 15 MHz. As a result, just a small fraction of MBs resonates at a given ultrasound frequency. MB suspensions with narrow size distributions can be tuned for a specific imaging frequency, boost CEUS sensitivity and enable deeper vascular imaging. However, their enhanced nonlinear behavior makes imaging susceptible to nonlinear wave propagation artifacts. Here, we numerically investigate the impact of the acoustic wavefront shape on the imaging of nonlinear, monodisperse MBs. Specifically, our approach relies on an extension of the Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method that accounts for all nonlinear effects in CEUS. We demonstrate that supersonic x-shaped wavefronts referred to as x-waves can be used to generate ultrasound images of monodisperse MBs without nonlinear wave propagation artifacts. On the contrary, imaging based on focused, planar and diverging wavefronts leads to significant nonlinear artifacts. Taken together, our results show that x-waves can harness the full potential of monodisperse MBs by enabling their sensitive and specific detection in a tissue context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning in atomistic materials science has grown to become a powerful tool, with most approaches focusing on atomic arrangements, typically decomposed into local atomic environments. This approach, while well-suited for machine-learned interatomic potentials, is conceptually at odds with learning complex intrinsic properties of materials, often driven by spectral properties commonly represented in reciprocal space (e.g., band gaps or mobilities) which cannot be readily atomically partitioned. For such applications, methods which represent the electronic rather than the atomic structure could be more promising. In this work, we present a general framework focused on electronic-structure descriptors which take advantage of the natural symmetries and inherent interpretability of physical models. Using this framework, we formulate two such representations and apply them respectively to measuring the similarity of carbon nanotubes and barium titanate polymorphs, and to the discovery of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) in the Materials Cloud 3D database (MC3D). A random forest classifier trained on 1% of the materials in the MC3D is able to correctly label 76% of entries in database which meet common screening criteria for promising TCMs.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithm for Quasi-2D Coulomb Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-2D Coulomb systems are of fundamental importance and have attracted much attention in many areas nowadays. Their reduced symmetry gives rise to interesting collective behaviors, but also brings great challenges for particle-based simulations. Here, we propose a novel algorithm framework to address the $\mathcal O(N^2)$ simulation complexity associated with the long-range nature of Coulomb interactions. First, we introduce an efficient Sum-of-Exponentials (SOE) approximation for the long-range kernel associated with Ewald splitting, achieving uniform convergence in terms of inter-particle distance, which reduces the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^{7/5})$. We then introduce a random batch sampling method in the periodic dimensions, the stochastic approximation is proven to be both unbiased and with reduced variance via a tailored importance sampling strategy, further reducing the computational cost to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated via varies numerical examples. Notably, it achieves a speedup of $2\sim 3$ orders of magnitude comparing with Ewald2D method, enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with up to $10^6$ particles on a single core. The present approach is therefore well-suited for large-scale particle-based simulations of Coulomb systems under confinement, making it possible to investigate the role of Coulomb interaction in many practical situations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven local operator finding for reduced-order modelling of plasma systems: I. Concept and verifications</title>

Abstract: Reduced-order plasma models that can efficiently predict plasma behavior across various settings and configurations are highly sought after yet elusive. The demand for such models has surged in the past decade due to their potential to facilitate scientific research and expedite the development of plasma technologies. In line with the advancements in computational power and data-driven methods, we introduce the "Phi Method" in this two-part article. Part I presents this novel algorithm, which employs constrained regression on a candidate term library informed by numerical discretization schemes to discover discretized systems of differential equations. We demonstrate Phi Method's efficacy in deriving reliable and robust reduced-order models (ROMs) for three test cases: the Lorenz attractor, flow past a cylinder, and a 1D Hall-thruster-representative plasma. Part II will delve into the method's application for parametric dynamics discovery. Our results show that ROMs derived from the Phi Method provide remarkably accurate predictions of systems' behavior, whether derived from steady-state or transient-state data. This underscores the method's potential for transforming plasma system modeling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven local operator finding for reduced-order modelling of plasma systems: II. Application to parametric dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world systems often exhibit dynamics influenced by various parameters, either inherent or externally controllable, necessitating models capable of reliably capturing these parametric behaviors. Plasma technologies exemplify such systems. For example, phenomena governing global dynamics in Hall thrusters (a spacecraft propulsion technology) vary with various parameters, such as the "self-sustained electric field". In this Part II, following on the introduction of our novel data-driven local operator finding algorithm, Phi Method, in Part I, we showcase the method's effectiveness in learning parametric dynamics to predict system behavior across unseen parameter spaces. We present two adaptations: the "parametric Phi Method" and the "ensemble Phi Method", which are demonstrated through 2D fluid-flow-past-a-cylinder and 1D Hall-thruster-plasma-discharge problems. Comparative evaluation against parametric OPT-DMD in the fluid case demonstrates superior predictive performance of the parametric Phi Method. Across both test cases, parametric and ensemble Phi Method reliably recover governing parametric PDEs and offer accurate predictions over test parameters. Ensemble ROM analysis underscores Phi Method's robust learning of dominant dynamic coefficients with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Near Field Computation in the MLFMA Algorithm with Data Redundancy and Performance Modeling on a Single GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) has known applications in scientific modeling in the fields of telecommunications, physics, mechanics, and chemistry. Accelerating calculation of far-field using GPUs and GPU clusters for large-scale problems has been studied for more than a decade. The acceleration of the Near Field Computation (P2P operator) however was less of a concern because it does not face the challenges of distributed processing which does far field. This article proposes a modification of the P2P algorithm and uses performance models to determine its optimality criteria. By modeling the speedup, we found that making threads independence by creating redundancy in the data makes the algorithm for lower dense (higher frequency) problems nearly 13 times faster than non-redundant mode.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Dynamical System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering dynamical equations from observed noisy data is the central challenge of system identification. We develop a statistical mechanical approach to analyze sparse equation discovery algorithms, which typically balance data fit and parsimony through a trial-and-error selection of hyperparameters. In this framework, statistical mechanics offers tools to analyze the interplay between complexity and fitness, in analogy to that done between entropy and energy. To establish this analogy, we define the optimization procedure as a two-level Bayesian inference problem that separates variable selection from coefficient values and enables the computation of the posterior parameter distribution in closed form. A key advantage of employing statistical mechanical concepts, such as free energy and the partition function, is in the quantification of uncertainty, especially in in the low-data limit; frequently encountered in real-world applications. As the data volume increases, our approach mirrors the thermodynamic limit, leading to distinct sparsity- and noise-induced phase transitions that delineate correct from incorrect identification. This perspective of sparse equation discovery, is versatile and can be adapted to various other equation discovery algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hybrid data-driven and physics-informed regularized learning of cyclic plasticity with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extendable, efficient and explainable Machine Learning approach is proposed to represent cyclic plasticity and replace conventional material models based on the Radial Return Mapping algorithm. High accuracy and stability by means of a limited amount of training data is achieved by implementing physics-informed regularizations and the back stress information. The off-loading of the Neural Network is applied to the maximal extent. The proposed model architecture is simpler and more efficient compared to existing solutions from the literature, while representing a complete three-dimensional material model. The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule. The latter, however, has a minor impact on the accuracy, which implies the generalizability of the model for a broad spectrum of evolution laws for internal variables. Numerical tests simulating several load cases are shown in detail and validated for accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Chemical Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas, from energy storage, to solvents for performing reactions in, to fluids for storing molecular gasses. Moreover, ILs have been touted as ``designer'' solvents, as they can be mixed to form complex fluids with tailored physiochemical properties. To make predictions of these properties, classical molecular dynamics (MD) have often been employed instead to simulate the dynamics of ILs, as it is computationally inexpensive. However, its accuracy is often under question, which motivates some to use density functional theory (DFT), but this is often prohibitively expensive, which imposes severe limitations on system sizes and time scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a way to bridge this simulation gap, offering a cheaper method than DFT but without significant loss in accuracy. As using MLIPs for ILs is still a relatively unexplored, several unanswered questions remain to see if MLIPs can be transformative in the space of ILs. As ILs are often not pure, but mixed together or with additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be chemically transferable whilst only being trained on a few compositions, using a salt-in-IL as a test case. Having demonstrated that a transferable model can be trained, we investigate the accuracy of a ML IP for a novel IL trained on less than 200 DFT frames. To test the predictions of this model, we compare it against DFT and experiments, and find reasonable agreement. Overall, we hope these results can be used as guidance for future development of MLIPs for ILs, and complex mixtures of them, to make accurate predictions of these novel electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Current-driven dynamics of antiferromagnetic skyrmions: from skyrmion Hall effects to hybrid inter-skyrmion scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions have emerged as a highly promising avenue in the realm of spintronics, particularly for the development of advanced racetrack memory devices. A distinguishing feature of AFM skyrmions is their zero topological charge and hence anticipated zero skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE). Here, we unveil that the latter is surprisingly finite under the influence of spin-transfer torque, depending on the direction of the injected current impinging on intrinsic AFM skyrmions emerging in CrPdFe trilayer on Ir(111) surface. Hinging on first-principles combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we identify the origin of the SkHE and uncover that FM skyrmions in the underlying Fe layer act as effective traps for AFM skyrmions, confining them and reducing their velocity. These findings hold significant promise for spintronic applications, the design of multi-purpose skyrmion-tracks, advancing our understanding of AFM-FM skyrmion interactions and hybrid soliton dynamics in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Derivative Runge-Kutta Flux Reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the fourth order, two stage Multi-Derivative Runge Kutta (MDRK) scheme of Li and Du to the Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework by writing both of the stages in terms of a time averaged flux and then use the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure. Numerical flux is computed in each stage using D2 dissipation and EA flux, enhancing Fourier CFL stability and accuracy respectively. A subcell based blending limiter is developed for the MDRK scheme, which ensures that the limited scheme is provably admissibility preserving. Along with being admissibility preserving, the blending scheme is constructed to minimize dissipation errors by using Gauss-Legendre solution points and performing MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells. The accuracy enhancement of the blending scheme is numerically verified on compressible Euler's equations, with test cases involving shocks and small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>A new HOC scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HOC scheme for 2D transient CDE on Cartesian coordinates reported in [1] is extended to cylindrical polar coordinates on nonuniform grids to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer around bluff bodies. In contrast to the most of HOC schemes developed on polar coordinates, as available in the literature, there is no necessity to transform domain for the present scheme. We begin the study by employing our scheme to two test problems having analytical solutions, followed by time marching simulation for driven polar cavity and natural convection in horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also developed. The scheme is found to be well capable of handling complex flow patterns as it combines the advantages of body fitted mesh as well as nonuniformity of grids. The scheme reported a second-order temporal convergence and in space it approached to fourth order convergence for problems with analytical solutions. For the cases where no analytical solutions are available, we have determined the perceived rate of convergence in space for all the variables. The computed values of various flow parameters are being compared to the values available in the literature. Results are extremely close to the available numerical and experimental results in all the cases, both qualitative and quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: We present a new methodology, based on the WKB approximation and Fast Fourier Transforms, for the evaluation of wave propagation through inhomogeneous media. This method can accurately resolve fields containing caustics, while still enjoying the computational advantages of the WKB approximation, namely, the ability to resolve arbitrarily high-frequency problems in computing times which are orders-of-magnitude shorter than those required by other algorithms presently available. For example, the proposed approach can simulate with high accuracy (with errors such as e.g. 0.1\%--0.001\%) the propagation of 5 cm radar signals across two-dimensional configurations resembling atmospheric ducting conditions, spanning hundreds of kilometers and millions of wavelengths in electrical size, in computing times of a few minutes in a single CPU core.

      <title>Efficient Full-frequency GW Calculations using a Lanczos Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GW approximation is widely used for reliable and accurate modeling of single-particle excitations. It also serves as a starting point for many theoretical methods, such as its use in the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and dynamical mean-field theory. However, full-frequency GW calculations for large systems with hundreds of atoms remain computationally challenging, even after years of efforts to reduce the prefactor and improve scaling. We propose a method that reformulates the correlation part of the GW self-energy as a resolvent of a Hermitian matrix, which can be efficiently and accurately computed using the standard Lanczos method. This method enables full-frequency GW calculations of material systems with a few hundred atoms on a single computing workstation. We further demonstrate the efficiency of the method by calculating the defect-state energies of silicon quantum dots with diameters up to 4 nm and nearly 2,000 silicon atoms using only 20 computational nodes.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Evaluation of a Physics-Constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Approach Coupled with CFD Solver for Modeling Stiff Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high computational cost associated with solving for detailed chemistry poses a significant challenge for predictive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of turbulent reacting flows. These models often require solving a system of coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While deep learning techniques have been experimented with to develop faster surrogate models, they often fail to integrate reliably with CFD solvers. This instability arises because deep learning methods optimize for training error without ensuring compatibility with ODE solvers, leading to accumulation of errors over time. Recently, NeuralODE-based techniques have offered a promising solution by effectively modeling chemical kinetics. In this study, we extend the NeuralODE framework for stiff chemical kinetics by incorporating mass conservation constraints directly into the loss function during training. This ensures that the total mass and the elemental mass are conserved, a critical requirement for reliable downstream integration with CFD solvers. Proof-of-concept studies are performed with physics-constrained neuralODE (PC-NODE) approach for homogeneous autoignition of hydrogen-air mixture over a range of composition and thermodynamic conditions. Our results demonstrate that this enhancement not only improves the physical consistency with respect to mass conservation criteria but also ensures better robustness. Lastly, a posteriori studies are performed wherein the trained PC-NODE model is coupled with a 3D CFD solver for computing the chemical source terms. PC-NODE is shown to be more accurate relative to the purely data-driven neuralODE approach. Moreover, PC-NODE also exhibits robustness and generalizability to unseen initial conditions from within (interpolative capability) as well as outside (extrapolative capability) the training regime.</description>

      <title>Saturation and multifractality of Lagrangian and Eulerian scaling exponents in 3D isotropic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial range scaling exponents for both Lagrangian and Eulerian structure functions are obtained from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence in triply periodic domains at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to 1300. We reaffirm that transverse Eulerian scaling exponents saturate at $\approx 2.1$ for moment orders $p \ge 10$, significantly differing from the longitudinal exponents (which are predicted to saturate at $\approx 7.3$ for $p \ge 30$ from a recent theory). The Lagrangian scaling exponents likewise saturate at $\approx 2$ for $p \ge 8$. The saturation of Lagrangian exponents and transverse Eulerian exponents is related by the same multifractal spectrum by utilizing the well known frozen hypothesis to relate spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this spectrum is different from the known spectra for Eulerian longitudinal exponents, suggesting that that Lagrangian intermittency is characterized solely by transverse Eulerian intermittency. We discuss possible implication of this outlook when extending multifractal predictions to the dissipation range, especially for Lagrangian acceleration.</description>

Abstract: Spintronic devices offer a promising avenue for the development of nanoscale, energy-efficient artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing. It has previously been shown that with antiferromagnetic (AFM) oscillators, ultra-fast spiking artificial neurons can be made that mimic many unique features of biological neurons. In this work, we train an artificial neural network of AFM neurons to perform pattern recognition. A simple machine learning algorithm called spike pattern association neuron (SPAN), which relies on the temporal position of neuron spikes, is used during training. In under a microsecond of physical time, the AFM neural network is trained to recognize symbols composed from a grid by producing a spike within a specified time window. We further achieve multi-symbol recognition with the addition of an output layer to suppress undesirable spikes. Through the utilization of AFM neurons and the SPAN algorithm, we create a neural network capable of high-accuracy recognition with overall power consumption on the order of picojoules.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fine-Tuning for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is an enhanced fine-tuned model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures, identified by the fine-tuned GNNs, are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling random Green's function (rGF) method for large-scale electronic structure calculation. In this method, the rGF is defined on a set of random states to stochastically express the density matrix, and rGF is calculated with the linear-scaling computational cost. We show the rGF method is generally applicable to the nonorthogonal localized basis, and circumvent the large Chebyshev expansion for the density matrix. As a demonstration, we implement rGF with density-functional Tight-Binding method and apply it to self-consistently calculate water clusters up 9984 H2Os. We find the rGF method combining with a simple fragment correction can reach an error of ~1meV per H2O in total energy, compared to the deterministic calculations, due to the self-average. The development of rGF method advances the stochastic electronic structure theory to a new stage of the efficiency and applicability.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in antiferromagnetic $Z^3$ nodal net metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In three dimensions, the quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport is commonly thought to only appear in the systems with Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals with topological node structure but without Q1D chain structure, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O and Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. All these materials have an AFM ground state and exhibit an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the whole Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AFM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, we find that the longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates the transport in the down-spin channel. This means that each spin channel has a Q1D transport signature, and the principal moving direction for the two spin channels is orthogonal, leading to Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon can not be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials, and may solely be induced by the $Z^3$ nodal net, as it gradually disappears when the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in antiferromagnets, but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>
