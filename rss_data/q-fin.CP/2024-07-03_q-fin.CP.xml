      <title>A Contextual Online Learning Theory of Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. At each round, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The broker suggests a trading price based on contextual data about the asset. Then, the traders decide to buy or sell depending on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price.
  We assume the market value of traded assets is an unknown linear function of a $d$-dimensional vector representing the contextual information available to the broker. Additionally, we model traders' valuations as independent bounded zero-mean perturbations of the asset's market value, allowing for potentially different unknown distributions across traders and time steps. Consistently with the existing online learning literature, we evaluate the performance of a learning algorithm with the regret with respect to the gain from trade. If the noise distributions admit densities bounded by some constant $L$, then, for any time horizon $T$:
  - If the agents' valuations are revealed after each interaction, we provide an algorithm achieving $O ( L d \ln T )$ regret, and show a corresponding matching lower bound of $\Omega( Ld \ln T )$.
  - If only their willingness to sell or buy at the proposed price is revealed after each interaction, we provide an algorithm achieving $O(\sqrt{LdT \ln T })$ regret, and show that this rate is optimal (up to logarithmic factors), via a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{LdT})$.
  To complete the picture, we show that if the bounded density assumption is lifted, then the problem becomes unlearnable, even with full feedback.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sectoral Profitability in the Indian Stock Market Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores using a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for accurate stock price prediction and its implications for portfolio design. Despite the efficient market hypothesis suggesting that predicting stock prices is impossible, recent research has shown the potential of advanced algorithms and predictive models. The study builds upon existing literature on stock price prediction methods, emphasizing the shift toward machine learning and deep learning approaches. Using historical stock prices of 180 stocks across 18 sectors listed on the NSE, India, the LSTM model predicts future prices. These predictions guide buy/sell decisions for each stock and analyze sector profitability. The study's main contributions are threefold: introducing an optimized LSTM model for robust portfolio design, utilizing LSTM predictions for buy/sell transactions, and insights into sector profitability and volatility. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the LSTM model in accurately predicting stock prices and informing investment decisions. By comparing sector profitability and prediction accuracy, the work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the current financial markets in India.</description>

      <title>Predicting public market behavior from private equity deals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We process private equity transactions to predict public market behavior with a logit model. Specifically, we estimate our model to predict quarterly returns for both the broad market and for individual sectors. Our hypothesis is that private equity investments (in aggregate) carry predictive signal about publicly traded securities. The key source of such predictive signal is the fact that, during their diligence process, private equity fund managers are privy to valuable company information that may not yet be reflected in the public markets at the time of their investment. Thus, we posit that we can discover investors' collective near-term insight via detailed analysis of the timing and nature of the deals they execute. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimated model by applying it to test data where we know the correct output value. Remarkably, our model performs consistently better than a null model simply based on return statistics, while showing a predictive accuracy of up to 70% in sectors such as Consumer Services, Communications, and Non Energy Minerals.</description>

      <title>CatMemo at the FinLLM Challenge Task: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models using Data Fusion in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into financial analysis has garnered significant attention in the NLP community. This paper presents our solution to IJCAI-2024 FinLLM challenge, investigating the capabilities of LLMs within three critical areas of financial tasks: financial classification, financial text summarization, and single stock trading. We adopted Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B as base models, fine-tuning them through Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches. To enhance model performance, we combine datasets from task 1 and task 2 for data fusion. Our approach aims to tackle these diverse tasks in a comprehensive and integrated manner, showcasing LLMs' capacity to address diverse and complex financial tasks with improved accuracy and decision-making capabilities.</description>
