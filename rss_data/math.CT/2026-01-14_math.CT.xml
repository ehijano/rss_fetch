      <title>Geometric Structures in $\mathbb{R}$-enriched adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A real $m\times n$ matrix $M$ determines tropical row and column polytopes in tropical projective spaces $\mathbb{TP}^{m-1}$ and $\mathbb{TP}^{n-1}$, with canonical polyhedral cell structures that are naturally dual. We reinterpret this picture via Isbell duality: viewing $M$ as an $Rbar$-enriched profunctor $M$: $C^{op}\otimes D\to Rbar$, we study the associated order-reversing Isbell adjunction $M^*\dashv M_*$ and its fixed-point locus, the nucleus $Nuc(M)$. After projectivization, $pnuc(M)$ carries two interacting geometries. On the metric side, $Rbar$-enrichment induces a canonical Hilbert projective--type (max-spread) metric on projective (co)presheaves, and we show that the projective Isbell maps identify the presheaf and copresheaf realizations of $pnuc(M)$ by mutually inverse isometries. On the polyhedral side, in the discrete real setting the Isbell inequalities cut out a canonical polyhedral decomposition of $pnuc(M)$ recovering the usual tropical cell structure. Our main new ingredient is a pointwise invariant of a nucleus point $(f,g)$: the nonnegative $\textit{gap matrix}$ $\delta^{(f,g)}(c,d)=M(c,d)-f(c)-g(d)$. Its zero pattern determines the cell containing $(f,g)$, while its positive entries compute exact metric distances to the boundary strata where additional inequalities become tight (Events Theorem). This distance-to-wall principle refines cells into order chambers and supports a constructible tower of complete lattices obtained by thresholding $\delta^{(f,g)}$.</description>

      <title>Binomial rings, and integral homology of complements of compact toric arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An \emph{affine subtorus} of the compact torus $T=(S^1)^n$ is a translated copy of a Lie subgroup. Given a finite collection $T_1,\ldots, T_k$ of such subtori, and a prime $p$, we describe an explicit chain complex that calculates the group $H_*(T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i,\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$. %The complex is determined by the integral homology maps induced by the inclusions $T_J\subset T_I$ where $I\subset J\subset\{1,\ldots, k\}$ and $T_I$ denotes $\bigcap_{i\in I} T_i$. Our main tool is the binomial models for spaces constructed by T.~Ekedahl. We use these results to express the groups $H_*(T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i,\mathbb{Z})$. We also show that the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence that converges to the homology of $T-\bigcup_{i=1}^k T_i$ collapses at the second page rationally, and also integrally under some assumptions on the arrangement $T_1,\ldots, T_k$, with all extension problems being trivial in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras and their free objects by Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic formulation of the derivation and integration related by the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FFTC) gives rise to the notion of differential Rota-Baxter algebra. The notion has a remarkable list of categorical properties, in terms of the existence of (co)extensions of differential and Rota-Baxter operators, of the lifting of monads and comonads, and of mixed distributive laws. Conversely, using these properties as axioms leads to a class of algebraic structures called para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras.
  This paper carries out a systematic study of para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. After their basic properties and examples from Hurwitz series and difference algebras, a Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases theory is established for para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. Then an explicit construction of free para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras is obtained.</description>

      <title>Unstable synthetic deformations I: Malcev theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of articles devoted to the construction and study of synthetic deformations of $\infty$-categories in the unstable context: that is, deformations of $\infty$-categories that categorify spectral sequence or obstruction-theoretic information.
  This paper sets up the foundations of our study. We introduce and study various classes of $\infty$-categorical and infinitary algebraic theories. We establish many basic properties of the $\infty$-categories of the models of different classes of theories, as well as recognition theorems identifying the $\infty$-categories that arise this way.
  We give an intrinsic definition of a Malcev theory in higher universal algebra. We establish that the $\infty$-category of models of a Malcev theory may be characterized as freely adjoining geometric realizations to the theory. This leads to the notion of a derived functor between $\infty$-categories of models of Malcev theories, and we study the behavior of these derived functors with respect to connectivity and limits.
  We recall the notion of a loop theory and study in detail the interaction between functors and derived functors of $\infty$-categories of loop models and models, establishing that a large class of comonads on the $\infty$-category of loop models deform canonically to the $\infty$-category of all models.
  In the last part of the paper, we show that by considering the coalgebras for these deformed comonads over $\infty$-categories of models, one can recover various stable deformations considered in the literature, such as filtered models or Postnikov-complete synthetic spectra. We then expand on these results by constructing $\infty$-categories of synthetic spaces and synthetic $\mathbf{E}_k$-rings.</description>

      <title>Lax functorialities of the comma construction for $\omega$-categories</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the Grothendieck construction, we study the functorialities of the comma construction for strict $\omega$-categories. To state the most general functorialities, we use the language of Gray $\omega$-categories, that is, categories enriched in the category of strict $\omega$-categories endowed with the oplax Gray tensor product. Our main result is that the comma construction of strict $\omega$-categories defines a Gray $\omega$-functor, that is, a morphism of Gray $\omega$-categories. To makes sense of this statement, we prove that slices of Gray $\omega$-categories exist. Coming back to the Grothendieck construction, we propose a definition in terms of the comma construction and, as a consequence, we get that the Grothendieck construction of strict $\omega$-categories defines a Gray $\omega$-functor. Finally, as a by-product, we get a notion of Grothendieck construction for Gray $\omega$-functors, which we plan to investigate in future work.</description>

      <title>Differential bundles as functors from free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores differential bundles in tangent categories, characterizing them as functors from a structure category. This is analogous to the actegory perspective of Garner and Leung, which we also use to describe the tangent categories of Rosick\'y, Cockett and Cruttwell. We generalize the Garner-Leung equivalence between tangent categories and Weil algebra actegories to include lax functors and non-linear natural transformations.
  The main result of this paper, is that differential functors between the structure category $\mathbb N^\bullet$ and a tangent category $\mathbb X$ are equivalent to differential bundles in $\mathbb X$.
  We obtain this result by showing that evaluating a differential functor on the generating object $\mathbb N^1$ of the structure category $\mathbb N^\bullet$ produces a differential bundle in a functorial way. Every differential bundle can be obtained this way. We show that obtaining such a functor from a bundle is a functorial construction.
  There are variations of these results for linear and additive morphisms of differential bundles.</description>

      <title>PROPs associated to Lawvere theories and their relation to polynomial functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several adjunctions between functor categories have been studied and applied previously. These include Powell's adjunction between functor categories on free groups and on the linear PROP associated with the Lie operad, as well as those implicit in the equivalence of Pirashvili between functors on projective modules and modules over wreath products. In this paper, for a Lawvere theory $\mathcal{C}$ with a zero object, we construct a natural linear PROP $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$, which carries a canonical adjunction between functor categories over $\mathcal{C}$ and $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$. The adjunction is compatible with polynomial degree, in the sense that it gives a correspondence between polynomial $\mathcal{C}$-modules and truncated $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$-modules. We suggest that this framework provides a useful step toward studying polynomial $\mathcal{C}$-modules. To support this perspective, a large part of this paper is devoted to explicit calculations of $\tilde{\Phi}_{\mathcal{C}}$ for a specific Lawvere theory $\mathcal{C}$. This construction unifies the previously known examples, and also yields new ones, including adjunctions for functor categories on modules over a ring, as well as on free nilpotent groups and, more generally, on free $\mathcal{R}$-semisimple groups, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a radical functor for groups.</description>
