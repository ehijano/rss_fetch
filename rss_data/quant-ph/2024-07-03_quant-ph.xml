      <title>Optimal Low-Depth Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum effects like entanglement and coherent amplification can be used to drastically enhance the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation beyond classical limits. However, challenges such as decoherence and time-dependent errors hinder Heisenberg-limited amplification. We introduce Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation algorithms that are robust against these challenges and achieve optimal performance as dictated by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. These algorithms use quantum signal transformation to decouple interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Combining provably optimal classical estimation with near-optimal quantum circuit design, our approach achieves an unprecedented standard deviation accuracy of $10^{-4}$ radians for estimating unwanted swap angles in superconducting two-qubit experiments, using low-depth ($&lt;10$) circuits. This represents up to two orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase errors, observing that the variance of the time-sensitive parameter $\varphi$ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg scaling in the small-depth regime. Our results are rigorously validated against the quantum Fisher information, confirming our protocol's ability to achieve unmatched precision for two-qubit gate learning.</description>

      <title>The single-photon steering and the quantum mechanical free-interaction measurement are identical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, firstly, we propose how to experimentally demonstrate the single photon steering phenomenon in a simple way. The quantum steering phenomenon was discovered by Erwin Schrodinger, who reason that the laws of quantum mechanics obliges us to admit that by suitable measurements taken on one of two entangled system, then the state of the other system can be determined and steered. On the other hand, the first proposal about the nonlocal property of a single photon focus on showing the Bell nonlocality by using the single-photon path entanglement. Here, we propose a new experimental scheme that, by incorporating and manipulating the internal degree of freedom (IDF) of the photon, easily demonstrate the nonlocal steering phenomenon of single-photon's states. The experimental set-up that we propose differs from those published in the quantum optics' literature to shown the single photon nonlocality, which generally use the path entanglement of photons and homodyne measurements. Secondly, by incorporating its IDF, we show that the single photon steering and the quantum mechanical interaction-free measurement (QM-IFM) are identical phenomena; we will argue that QM-IFM is just a particular instance of the single-photon steering. In short, both the single photon steering and QM-IFM (being identical phenomena) have a common cause: the nonlocality of the wave function. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is possible to produce a nonlocal phenomena by manipulating the single photon internal degree of freedom. On the other hand, this unification between steering and QM-IFM could establish a strong support to counterfactual quantum communication and computation.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant noise guessing decoding of quantum random codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the open question of implementing fault-tolerant QRLCs with feasible computational overhead. We present a new decoder for quantum random linear codes (QRLCs) capable of dealing with imperfect decoding operations. A first approach, introduced by Cruz et al., only considered channel errors, and perfect gates at the decoder. Here, we analyze the fault-tolerant characteristics of QRLCs with a new noise-guessing decoding technique, when considering preparation, measurement, and gate errors in the syndrome extraction procedure, while also accounting for error degeneracy. Our findings indicate a threshold error rate ($\pth$) of approximately $\pnum$ in the asymptotic limit, while considering realistic noise levels in the mentioned physical procedures.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Transmission Amplitudes in a Digital Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Free Binary Decision Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computation to prepare a quantum state for a given classical description of the quantum state. The classical description of an $n$-qubit quantum state may have $\exp(O(n))$ parameters in general, which are inherently inefficient to deal with in the worst case; however, in many practical cases, we may be able to employ suitable data structures to represent such large-scale data in a compressed way, e.g., by using a free binary decision diagram (FBDD), a rooted directed acyclic graph with two terminal nodes to concisely represent a Boolean function. We here construct a quantum algorithm for QSP when the classical description of a quantum state is given by an FBDD with weighted edges, and analyze the space, and time complexity of QSP in this setting. We provide a nontrivial example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ nodes rather than $\mathrm{exp}(O(n))$. We show that any quantum state represented by the weighted FBDD with $N$ nodes can be prepared by an $O(N)$-sized quantum circuit using $N$ ancillary qubits, exponentially improving the required circuit size for QSP compared to other BDD-based QSPs. We also provide another example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(n^2)$ nodes, and $O(n^2)$ ancillary qubits, but cannot be prepared efficiently by a QSP based on the amplitude amplification. These results provide techniques to employ FBDDs as a tool for broadening the possibility of efficient QSP.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on quantum complexity of time-dependent oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work had shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It provides a proof of concept for the application of Nielsen complexity in cosmology, together with a systematic setting in which higher-order terms can be included.</description>

      <title>Cluster truncated Wigner approximation for bond-disordered Heisenberg spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the cluster Truncated Wigner Approximation (cTWA) applied to quench dynamics in bond-disordered Heisenberg spin chains with power-law interactions. We find that cTWA yields highly accurate results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy hinges on a suitable choice of clusters. By using a clustering strategy inspired by the strong disorder renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space renormalization group (RSRG), clusters of two spins are sufficient to obtain essentially exact results in the regime of strong disorder. Surprisingly, even for rather weak disorder, e.g.\ in the presence of very long-range interactions, this choice of clustering outperforms a naive choice of clusters of consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete sampling scheme for the initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally introduced scheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme puts cTWA on the same conceptional footing as regular dTWA for single spins and yields some reduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.</description>

      <title>Clifford Dressed Time-Dependent Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm for Matrix Product States (MPS) that integrates Clifford disentangling techniques to efficiently manage entanglement growth. By leveraging the Clifford group, which maps Pauli strings to other Pauli strings while maintaining low computational complexity, we introduce a Clifford dressed single-site 1-TDVP scheme. During the TDVP integration, we apply a global Clifford transformation as needed to reduce entanglement by iteratively sweeping over two-qubit Clifford unitaries that connect neighboring sites in a checkerboard pattern. We validate the new algorithm numerically using various quantum many-body models, including both integrable and non-integrable systems. Our results demonstrate that the Clifford dressed TDVP significantly improves entanglement management and computational efficiency, achieving higher accuracy, extended simulation times, and enhanced precision in computed observables compared to standard TDVP approaches. Additionally, we propose incorporating Clifford gates directly within the two-site 2-TDVP scheme.</description>

      <title>Operational advantage of quantum resources in a semi-device independent framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources are fundamental for the development of quantum technology. Thus, verifying their presence is crucial for studying their role in various information-processing tasks. Here, we enquire whether can one detect the presence of a quantum resource in some operational task or equivalently does every quantum resource provides an advantage over its free counterpart in some black box scenario where one does not have much information about the devices. We introduce the framework for detecting quantum resources semi-device independently by considering the prepare-and-operation scenario with the restriction on the dimension of the quantum channel connecting the preparation box with the operation box. For any dimension $d$, we show that for any resource theory with less than $d^2$ number of linearly independent free states or free operations, there exist correlations that can detect the presence of a quantum resource. For the particular case when the quantum channel is constrained to transmit only qubits, we explicitly construct witnesses to observe the presence of various quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians and the quasiparticle picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an exact analytic result for the EH following a generic quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models. This derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to the EH, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a crucial technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system, which is essential for many applications in quantum technologies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging neural networks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography. Still, many of them did not include mixed quantum state, since pure states are arguably less common in practical situations. In this research paper, we present two neural networks based approach for both pure and mixed quantum state tomography: Restricted Feature Based Neural Network and Mixed States Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to existing neural based methods. We demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art results in reconstructing mixed quantum states from experimental data. Our work highlights the potential of neural networks in revolutionizing quantum state tomography and facilitating the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum interrogation measurements using constructive interference and post-selection to achieve single-pass high-efficiency detection for imperfect or semi-transparent absorbers. We illustrate that our method works for heralded single-photon as well as weak attenuated sources. We also study the influence of error from our equipment and show that post-selection renders robustness to our scheme against noise. We further demonstrate that with a small extension, we can quantify the transmittance of the imperfect absorber by using the process of weak value amplification (WVA)</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state thermodynamics of a photodevice which can operate as a solar cell or a photoconductor, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the junction. The thermodynamic efficiency is captured by a single coefficient of performance. Using a minimal model, we show that when the electron repulsion energy matches the transport gap of the junction, the photoconductor displays maximal response, performance and signal-to-noise ratio, while the same regime is always detrimental for the solar cell. Nevertheless, we find that electron repulsion is beneficial for the solar cell if it lies below the transport gap. Our work sheds important light on design principles for thermodynamically efficient photodevices in the presence of interactions.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering a single lossy three-dimensional cavity mode and using a quasinormal mode expansion for the photonic medium, we show that the frequency-dependence of the coupling between the cavity and its reservoir is dependent on both the cavity contents and the gauge used. For the case of coupling to a single quantum dipole, we identify the form of the spectral density, revealing a $\sim \omega^{-1}$ prefactor scaling, as well as a spatially-dependent contribution. We thus establish the correct quantum form for the cavity-reservoir interaction and show its significant impact on broadband strong coupling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified analog quantum simulation protocol for preparing quantum states that embed solutions of parabolic partial differential equations, including the heat, Black-Scholes and Fokker-Planck equations. The key idea is to approximate the heat equations by a system of hyperbolic heat equations that involve only first-order differential operators. This scheme requires relatively simple interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, which are the electric and magnetic dipole moment-like interaction terms that would be present in a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. For a d-dimensional problem, we show that it is much more appropriate to use a single d-level quantum system - a qudit - instead of its qubit counterpart, and d+1 qumodes. The total resource cost is efficient in d and precision error, and has potential for realisability for instance in cavity and circuit QED systems.</description>

      <title>Imposing Constraints on Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators: From Theory to Practical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators such that they satisfy constraints is an important ansatz construction for quantum algorithms. We give general algebraic expressions for finding Hamiltonian terms and analogously unitary primitives, that satisfy constraint embeddings and use these to give complexity characterizations of the related problems. Finding operators that enforce classical constraints is proven to be NP-Complete in the general case; algorithmic procedures with worse-case polynomial runtime to find any operators with a constant locality bound, applicable for many constraints. We then give algorithmic procedures to turn these algebraic primitives into Hamiltonian drivers and unitary mixers that can be used for Constrained Quantum Annealing (CQA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) constructions by tackling practical problems related to finding an appropriate set of reduced generators and defining corresponding drivers and mixers accordingly. We then apply these concepts to the construction of ansaetze for 1-in-3 SAT instances. We consider the ordinary x-mixer QAOA, a novel QAOA approach based on the maximally disjoint subset, and a QAOA approach based on the disjoint subset as well as higher order constraint satisfaction terms. We empirically benchmark these approaches on instances sized between 12 and 22, showing the best relative performance for the tailored ansaetze and that exponential curve fits on the results are consistent with a quadratic speedup by utilizing alternative ansaetze to the x-mixer. We provide very general algorithmic prescriptions for finding driver or mixing terms that satisfy embedded constraints that can be utilized to probe quantum speedups for constraints problems with linear, quadratic, or even higher order polynomial constraints.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rotational Cavity Optomechanics Using Atomic Superfluid in a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid optomechanical system containing an annularly trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity driven by Lauguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Spiral phase elements serve as the end mirrors of the cavity such that the rear mirror oscillates torsionally about the cavity axis through a clamped support. As described earlier in a related system [P. Kumar et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 113601 (2021)], the condensate atoms interact with the optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum which create two atomic side modes. We observe three peaks in the output noise spectrum corresponding to the atomic side modes and rotating mirror frequencies, respectively. We find that the trapped BEC's rotation reduces quantum fluctuations at the mirror's resonance frequency. We also find that the atomic side modes-cavity coupling and the optorotational coupling can produce bipartite and tripartite entanglements between various constituents of our hybrid system. We reduce the frequency difference between the side modes and the mirror by tuning the drive field's topological charge and the condensate atoms' rotation. When the atomic side modes become degenerate with the mirror, the stationary entanglement between the cavity and the mirror mode diminishes due to the suppression of cooling. Our proposal, which combines atomic superfluid circulation with mechanical rotation, provides a versatile platform for reducing quantum fluctuations and producing macroscopic entanglement with experimentally realizable parameters.</description>

      <title>Suppression of noise in separation estimation of optical sources with spatial-mode demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial mode demultiplexing was proved to be a successful tool for estimation of the separation between incoherent sources, allowing for sensitivity much below the Rayleigh limit. However, with the presence of measurement's noise, superresolution brought by this technique deteriorates rapidly. On a formal ground, this can be seen in terms of, so called, Rayleigh curse known from direct imaging, which while being absent for ideal spatial mode demultiplexing, goes back in a noisy scenario. In this article, we introduce a procedure to suppress the destructive effect of the noise, proposing a procedure effectively working as an error correction. For noise models given by a random unitary channel generated by a polynomial of creation and annihilation operators, we demonstrate that perfect noise decoupling can be reached by repeating the mode demultiplexers and intervening them by a group of rotations, in the limit of a large number of repetitions and small noise strength. For a special case of displacement noise, our solution is simplified: by using the demultiplexer twice, and interlacing it by a parity operator, given that the noise configuration is frozen between the first and the second step, a perfect decoupling can be achieved. This allows for a recovery of superresolution for a special class of noise generated by displacement operators. Furthermore, for a strong noise correlation between these two steps, our protocol provides an improved measurement resolution.</description>

      <title>Parametric Light-Matter Interaction in the Single-Photon Strong Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric coupling between harmonic oscillators has enabled exquisite measurement precision and control of linear resonators, being extensively studied, for example, in cavity optomechanics. This level of control has been made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this article, we demonstrate a new paradigm of parametrically coupled microwave circuits replacing one \textit{linear} microwave cavity with a superconducting transmon qubit. Our system utilizes photon-pressure coupling between the transmon qubit and a highly linear microwave resonator, a microwave analog of the radiation-pressure interaction. Applying a strong sideband drive results in an on-demand, non-linear Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the linear resonator. We also observe a single-photon coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the single-photon strong coupling regime. This demonstration of photon-pressure Jaynes-Cummings interactions paves the way for developing novel photon-pressure quantum information processing hardware and will enable exotic tests of quantum gravity in the future by interfacing this new platform with mechanical resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions in spin-based Hamiltonians are crucial in addressing numerous fundamentally significant physical problems. In this work, Rydberg-atom graph gadgets are introduced to effectively program $K$-th order interactions within a Rydberg atom system. This approach facilitates the determination of the ground states of an Ising-type Hamiltonian, encoded to solve higher-order unconstrained optimization problems. A favorable scaling behavior, $O(N^K)$, is expected in terms of the number of atoms required for $N$-vertex hypergraph optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel class of quantum mechanical particle oscillations in both relativistic and nonrelativistic systems based on $PT$ symmetry and $T^2=-1$, where $P$ is parity and $T$ is time reversal. The Hamiltonians are chosen at the outset to be self-adjoint with respect to a PT inner product. The quantum mechanical time evolution is based on a modified CPT inner product constructed in terms of a suitable C operator. The resulting quantum mechanical evolution is shown to be unitary and probability is conserved by the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Convexity of noncontextual wirings and how they order the set of correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resource theory of contextuality considers resourceful objects to be probabilistic data-tables, known as correlations or behaviors, that fail to have an explanation in terms of Kochen-Specker noncontextual models. In this work, we advance this resource theory, considering free operations to be noncontextual wirings (NCW). We show that all such wirings form a convex set. When restricted to Bell scenarios, we show that such wirings are not equivalent to local operations assisted by a common source of classical shared randomness (LOSR). The set of all NCW operations contains LOSR, but is strictly larger. We also prove several elementary facts about how different resources can be converted via NCW. As a concrete example, we show that there are pairs of behaviors that cannot be converted one into the other using NCW. Since resource conversion mathematically induces a pre-order over the set of all behaviors, our results reveal the intricate ordering induced by NCW in scenarios beyond Bell scenarios.</description>

      <title>State Transfer in Noisy Modular Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is the act of transferring quantum information from one system in a quantum network to another without physically transporting carriers of quantum information, but instead engineering a Hamiltonian such that the state of the sender is transferred to the receiver through the dynamics of the whole network. A generalization of quantum state transfer called quantum routing concerns simultaneous transfers between multiple pairs in a quantum network, imposing limitations on its structure. In this article we consider transfer of Gaussian states over noisy quantum networks with modular structure, which have been identified as a suitable platform for quantum state routing. We compare two noise models, affecting either the network topology or the network constituents, studying their effects on both the transfer fidelities and the network properties. We find that the two models affect different features of the network allowing for the identification and quantification of the noise. We then use these features as a guide towards different strategies for the compensation of the noise, and examine how the compensation strategies perform. Our results show that in general, modular networks are more robust to noise than monolithic ones.</description>

      <title>Predicting correlations in superradiant emission from a cascaded quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent experiments, a novel type of cascaded quantum system has been realized using nanofiber-coupled cold atomic ensembles. This setup has enabled the study of superradiant decay of highly excited collective spin states of up to a thousand atoms, featuring unidirectional coupling mediated by the waveguide mode. The complexity arising from the large, multi-excited ensemble and the cascaded interactions between atoms makes conventional simulation methods unsuitable for predicting the correlations of superradiant emission beyond the first order. To address this challenge, we developed a new simulation technique based on the truncated Wigner approximation for spins. Our stochastic simulation tool can predict the second-order quantum coherence function, $g^{(2)}$, along with other correlators of the light field emitted by a strongly excited cascaded system of two-level emitters. This approach thus provides an effective and scalable method for analyzing cascaded quantum systems with large numbers of particles.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a machine-learning approach for globally calibrating the large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) photonics leverages photonic chips to accelerate artificial intelligence, offering high-speed and energy efficient solutions for use in RF communication, tensor processing, and data classification. However, the limited physical size of integrated photonic hardware limits network complexity and computational capacity. In light of recent advance in photonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential speedup to scale photonic neural network capacity without increasing the network size. Here we show a combination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable quantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and accuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same performance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice the size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through added noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated at state of the art bit precision. These hybrid quantum classical networks demonstrate a unique route to improve computational capacity of integrated photonic neural networks without increasing the network size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to achieve quantum advantage. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. We define the curriculum criteria based on the data density ratio between tasks to determine the curriculum order. We also implement a dynamic learning schedule to emphasize the significance of quantum data in optimizing the loss function. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL enhances the training convergence and the generalization for unitary learning tasks and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Our framework provides a general learning strategy, bringing QML closer to realizing practical advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that, by the same criteria that led to Galilean and Special Relativity and gauge symmetries, there is no way to identify a unique set of observables that give the structure of space or spacetime. In some sense, space is lost in the state space itself. Moreover, the relationship between the observables and the physical properties they represent becomes relative. But we can verify that they are not relative, and the spacetime structure is unique. I show that this implies that not all structures isomorphic with observers can be observers, contradicting Structural Realism and Physicalism. This indicates a strong connection between spacetime and the sentience of the observers, as anticipated by some early contributors to Special and General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective phenomena in physics emerge from interactions among numerous components in a complex system, leading to behaviors distinct from those of individual parts. This domain includes classical phenomena like synchronization and extends to quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and super-radiance. Studying these phenomena in controlled artificial systems allows for simulating complex natural systems. Solid-state mechanical oscillators, controllable via optomechanical coupling, have been proposed for exploring collective phenomena, but experimental realizations face the challenge of requiring nearly degenerate mechanical oscillators. In this work, we present the collective behavior of six mechanical oscillators coupled to a common cavity in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. We experimentally demonstrate that increasing the optomechanical coupling rates induces a transition from individual mechanical oscillators to a collective mode, characterized by equal amplitude and relative phase of the oscillators. By utilizing the finite non-degeneracy of mechanical frequencies and rapidly quenching the optomechanical couplings, we directly measure the amplitude and relative phase of the oscillators in the collective mode. We find that the coupling rate of such mode to the cavity increases with the number of coupled oscillators, similar to a Tavis-Cummings system. Further increasing the coupling rates pushes this collective mode into the strong coupling regime with the cavity. We demonstrate sideband ground-state cooling of the collective mode, achieving a 0.4 quanta occupation, and observe quantum sideband asymmetry for this mode. Observing collective optomechanical phenomena in the quantum regime opens avenues for studying synchronization, investigating topological phases of sound, and achieving multipartite phonon-phonon and photon-phonon entanglement.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation with stabilized noise in superconducting quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-fault tolerant quantum computers have already demonstrated the ability to estimate observable values accurately, at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. This has been enabled by error mitigation techniques that often rely on a representative model on the device noise. However, learning and maintaining these models is complicated by fluctuations in the noise over unpredictable time scales, for instance, arising from resonant interactions between superconducting qubits and defect two-level systems (TLS). Such interactions affect the stability and uniformity of device performance as a whole, but also affect the noise model accuracy, leading to incorrect observable estimation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that tuning of the qubit-TLS interactions helps reduce noise instabilities and consequently enables more reliable error-mitigation performance. These experiments provide a controlled platform for studying the performance of error mitigation in the presence of quasi-static noise. We anticipate that the capabilities introduced here will be crucial for the exploration of quantum applications on solid-state processors at non-trivial scales.</description>

      <title>Simple proof that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations of fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely known that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of fermions in one dimension. Yet, as far as the author is aware, there is no direct proof of this in the literature. This work shows that the $sign$ of the $N$-fermion anti-symmetric free propagator is given by the product of all possible pairs of particle separations, or relative displacements. For a non-vanishing closed-loop product of such propagators, as required by PIMC, all relative displacements from adjacent propagators are paired into perfect squares, and therefore the loop product must be positive, but only in one dimension. By comparison, permutation sampling, which does not evaluate the determinant of the anti-symmetric propagator exactly, remains plagued by a low-level sign problem, even in one dimension.</description>

Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Everything that can be learned about a causal structure with latent variables by observational and interventional probing schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What types of differences among causal structures with latent variables are impossible to distinguish by statistical data obtained by probing each visible variable? If the probing scheme is simply passive observation, then it is well-known that many different causal structures can realize the same joint probability distributions. Even for the simplest case of two visible variables, for instance, one cannot distinguish between one variable being a causal parent of the other and the two variables sharing a latent common cause. However, it is possible to distinguish between these two causal structures if we have recourse to more powerful probing schemes, such as the possibility of intervening on one of the variables and observing the other. Herein, we address the question of which causal structures remain indistinguishable even given the most informative types of probing schemes on the visible variables. We find that two causal structures remain indistinguishable if and only if they are both associated with the same mDAG structure (as defined by Evans (2016)). We also consider the question of when one causal structure dominates another in the sense that it can realize all of the joint probability distributions that can be realized by the other using a given probing scheme. (Equivalence of causal structures is the special case of mutual dominance.) Finally, we investigate to what extent one can weaken the probing schemes implemented on the visible variables and still have the same discrimination power as a maximally informative probing scheme.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>

      <title>Time and its arrow from quantum geometrodynamics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking's black hole area theorem provides a geometric realization of the second law of thermodynamics and constrains gravitational processes. In this work we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in terms of the monotonicity properties of R\'enyi entropies. We focus on black hole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which these R\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic inequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black hole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent bounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Processes in Open Quantum Systems. III. Large Deviations of First Passage Time Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-Markov process method is used to calculate large deviations of first passage time statistics of counting variables in open quantum systems. The core formula is an equation of poles. Although it also calculates large deviations of counting statistics of the same variables, the degrees of the equation are distinct with respect to the two statistics. Because the former is usually lower than the latter in the quantum case, analytical solutions for the first passage time statistics are possible. We illustrate these results via a driven two-level quantum system and apply them to explore quantum violations of the classical kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bit Labeling in Factorization Machines with Annealing for Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently find an optimum parameter combination in a large-scale problem, it is a key to convert the parameters into available variables in actual machines. Specifically, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems are solved with the help of machine learning, e.g., factorization machines with annealing, which convert a raw parameter to binary variables. This work investigates the dependence of the convergence speed and the accuracy on binary labeling method, which can influence the cost function shape and thus the probability of being captured at a local minimum solution. By exemplifying traveling salesman problem, we propose and evaluate Gray labeling, which correlates the Hamming distance in binary labels with the traveling distance. Through numerical simulation of traveling salesman problem up to 15 cities at a limited number of iterations, the Gray labeling shows less local minima percentages and shorter traveling distances compared with natural labeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, quasi-molecular compounds consisting of one antiproton ($\bar{p}$) and one hydrogen-like ion are investigated: $\mathrm{He}^{+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Li}^{2+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{C}^{5+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{S}^{15+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Kr}^{35+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Ho}^{66+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Re}^{74+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{U}^{91+} - \bar{p}$. For the calculations, the Dirac equation with two-center potential is solved numerically using the dual-kinetically balanced finite-basis-set method adapted to systems with axial symmetry (A-DKB). Adiabatic potential curves are constructed for the ground state of the above quasi-molecular compounds in the framework of the A-DKB approach. Calculations were also performed for the case of an external magnetic field (the field is taken into account non-perturbatively). Zeeman shifts of the quasi-molecular terms are obtained for a homogeneous magnetic field with a strength of the laboratory order (up to 100 Tesla) directed along the axis of the molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a "symmetric" quantum droplet in two spatial dimensions, which rotates in a harmonic potential, focusing mostly on the limit of "rapid" rotation. We examine this problem using a purely numerical approach, as well as a semi-analytic Wigner-Seitz approximation (first developed by Baym, Pethick et al.) for the description of the state with a vortex lattice. Within this approximation we assume that each vortex occupies a cylindrical cell, with the vortex-core size treated as a variational parameter. Working with a fixed angular momentum, as the angular momentum increases and depending on the atom number, the droplet accommodates none, few, or many vortices, before it turns to center-of-mass excitation. For the case of a "large" droplet, working with a fixed rotational frequency of the trap $\Omega$, as $\Omega$ approaches the trap frequency $\omega$, a vortex lattice forms, the number of vortices increases, the mean spacing between them decreases, while the "size" of each vortex increases as compared to the size of each cell. In contrast to the well-known problem of contact interactions, where we have melting of the vortex lattice and highly-correlated many-body states, here no melting of the vortex lattice is present, even when $\Omega = \omega$. This difference is due to the fact that the droplet is self-bound. Actually, for $\Omega = \omega$, the "smoothed" density distribution becomes a flat top, very much like the static droplet. When $\Omega$ exceeds $\omega$, the droplet maintains its shape and escapes to infinity, via center-of-mass motion.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for machine learning force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence of topological phases suggests strong connections between the topological features in a d+1-dimensional bulk and the potentially gapless theory on the (d-1)+1-dimensional boundary. In 2+1D topological phases, a direct correspondence can exist between anyonic excitations in the bulk and the topological point defects/primary fields in the boundary 1+1D conformal field theory. In this paper, we study how line excitations in 3+1D topological phases become line defects in the boundary 2+1D theory using the Topological Holography/Symmetry Topological Field Theory framework. We emphasize the importance of "descendent" line excitations and demonstrate in particular the effect of the Majorana chain defect: it leads to a distinct loop condensed gapped boundary state of the 3+1D fermionic Z2 topological order, and leaves signatures in the 2+1D Majorana-cone critical theory that describes the transition between the two types of loop condensed boundaries. Effects of non-invertible line excitations, such as Cheshire strings, are also discussed in bosonic 3+1D topological phases and the corresponding 2+1D critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rodeo algorithm is an efficient algorithm for eigenstate preparation and eigenvalue estimation for any observable on a quantum computer. This makes it a promising tool for studying the spectrum and structure of atomic nuclei as well as other fields of quantum many-body physics. The only requirement is that the initial state has sufficient overlap probability with the desired eigenstate. While it is exponentially faster than well-known algorithms such as phase estimation and adiabatic evolution for eigenstate preparation, it has yet to be implemented on an actual quantum device. In this work, we apply the rodeo algorithm to determine the energy levels of a random one-qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in a relative error of $0.08\%$ using mid-circuit measurements on the IBM Q device Casablanca. This surpasses the accuracy of directly-prepared eigenvector expectation values using the same quantum device. We take advantage of the high-accuracy energy determination and use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem to compute eigenvector expectation values for a different random one-qubit observable. For the Hellmann-Feynman calculations, we find a relative error of $0.7\%$. We conclude by discussing possible future applications of the rodeo algorithm for multi-qubit Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs) are immensely valuable in cryptographic interactions between a classical client and a quantum server. Typically, a protocol has the quantum server prepare a superposition of two-bit strings of a claw and then measure it using Pauli-$X$ or $Z$ measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique that uses the entire range of qubit measurements from the $XY$-plane. We show the advantage of this approach in two applications. First, building on (Brakerski et al. 2018, Kalai et al. 2022), we show an optimized two-round proof of quantumness whose security can be expressed directly in terms of the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem. Second, we construct a one-round protocol for blind remote preparation of an arbitrary state on the $XY$-plane up to a Pauli-$Z$ correction.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for implementing noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require multiple measurements of the noise spectral density at different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative method for quickly characterizing the spectral density. Our method uses mathematical techniques for phase retrieval, in order to generate random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations among the pulses, which can measure arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectrum. Such measurements allow us to estimate $k$'th-order moments of the noise spectrum, as well as to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</description>

Abstract: The classical embeddability problem asks whether a given stochastic matrix $T$, describing transition probabilities of a $d$-level system, can arise from the underlying homogeneous continuous-time Markov process. Here, we investigate the quantum version of this problem, asking of the existence of a Markovian quantum channel generating state transitions described by a given $T$. More precisely, we aim at characterising the set of quantum-embeddable stochastic matrices that arise from memoryless continuous-time quantum evolution. To this end, we derive both upper and lower bounds on that set, providing new families of stochastic matrices that are quantum-embeddable but not classically-embeddable, as well as families of stochastic matrices that are not quantum-embeddable. As a result, we demonstrate that a larger set of transition matrices can be explained by memoryless models if the dynamics is allowed to be quantum, but we also identify a non-zero measure set of random processes that cannot be explained by either classical or quantum memoryless dynamics. Finally, we fully characterise extreme stochastic matrices (with entries given only by zeros and ones) that are quantum-embeddable.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for characterizing quantum temporal correlations in a general temporal scenario, in which an initial quantum state is measured, sent through a quantum channel, and finally measured again. This framework does not make any assumptions on the system nor on the measurements, namely, it is device-independent. It is versatile enough, however, to allow for the addition of further constraints in a semi-device-independent setting. Our framework serves as a natural tool for quantum certification in a temporal scenario when the quantum devices involved are uncharacterized or partially characterized. It can hence also be used for characterizing quantum temporal correlations when one assumes an additional constraint of no-signalling in time, there are upper bounds on the involved systems' dimensions, rank constraints -- for which we prove genuine quantum separations over local hidden variable models -- or further linear constraints. We present a number of applications, including bounding the maximal violation of temporal Bell inequalities, quantifying temporal steerability, bounding the maximum successful probability in quantum randomness access codes.</description>

      <title>Compiling Quantum Circuits for Dynamically Field-Programmable Neutral Atoms Array Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03487v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays (DPQA) have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. In DPQA, atomic qubits are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured during the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel, entangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program execution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new challenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which places and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we consider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D array movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this architecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a satisfiability modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers optimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated by random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces the number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x compared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To further improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a greedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical integrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy and optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits feature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture, resulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits. These methods enable programmable, complex quantum circuits with neutral atom quantum computers, as well as informing both future compilers and future hardware choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventionally, the total correlations within a quantum system are quantified through distance-based expressions such as the relative entropy or the square-norm. Those expressions imply that a quantum state can contain both classical and quantum correlations. In this work, we provide an alternative method to quantify the total correlations through the Pearson correlation coefficient. Using this method, we argue that a quantum state can be correlated in either a classical or a quantum way, i.e., the two cases are mutually exclusive. We also illustrate that, at least for the case of two-qubit systems, the distribution of the correlations among certain locally incompatible pairs of observables provides insight in regards to whether a system contains classical or quantum correlations. Finally, we show how correlations in quantum systems are connected to the general entropic uncertainty principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are valuable platforms for testing the tenets of quantum computing, but these devices are susceptible to errors arising from de-coherence, leakage, cross-talk and other sources of noise. This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM Washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes. Consequently, the device proved unreliable for consistently reproducing the statistical mean in the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is the standard technique for reconstructing a quantum state from experimental data. In the regime of finite statistics, experimental data cannot give perfect information about the quantum state. A common way to express this limited knowledge is by providing confidence regions in the state space. Though other confidence regions were previously proposed, they are either too wasteful to be of practical interest, cannot easily be applied to general measurement schemes, or are too difficult to report. Here we construct confidence regions that solve these issues, as they have an asymptotically optimal sample cost and good performance for realistic parameters, are applicable to any measurement scheme, and can be described by an ellipsoid in the space of Hermitian operators. Our construction relies on a vector Bernstein inequality and bounds with high probability the Hilbert-Schmidt norm error of sums of multinomial samples transformed by linear maps.</description>

Abstract: By the Majorana representation, for any $d &gt; 1$ there is a one-one correspondence between a quantum state of dimension $d$ and $d-1$ qubits represented as $d-1$ points in the Bloch sphere. Using the theory of symmetry class of tensors, we present a simple scheme for constructing $d-1$ points on the Bloch sphere and the corresponding $d-1$ qubits representing a $d$-dimensional quantum state. Additionally, we demonstrate how the inner product of two $d$-dimensional quantum states can be expressed as a permanent of a matrix related to their $(d-1)$-qubit state representations. Extension of the result to mixed states is also considered.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the transmission of information that is secure against general attacks by eavesdroppers. The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 * 10^{-5} with an average quantum bit error ratio of ~ 0.65 % are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications.</description>

Abstract: Identifying Bell states without destroying it is frequently dealt with in nowadays quantum technologies such as quantum communication and quantum computing. In practice, quantum entangled states are often distributed among distant parties, and it might be required to determine them separately at each location, without inline communication between parties. We present a scheme for discriminating an arbitrary Bell state distributed to two distant parties without destroying it. The scheme requires two entangled states that are pre-shared between the parties, and we show that without these ancillary resources, the probability of non-destructively discriminating the Bell state is bounded by 1/4, which is the same as random guessing. Furthermore, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment through an IonQ quantum computer that our scheme can surpass classical bounds when applied to practical quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Integrating quantum and classical computing for multi-energy system optimization using Benders decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During recent years, quantum computers have received increasing attention, primarily due to their ability to significantly increase computational performance for specific problems. Computational performance could be improved for mathematical optimization by quantum annealers. This special type of quantum computer can solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. However, multi-energy systems optimization commonly involves integer and continuous decision variables. Due to their mixed-integer problem structure, quantum annealers cannot be directly used for multi-energy system optimization. To solve multi-energy system optimization problems, we present a hybrid Benders decomposition approach combining optimization on quantum and classical computers. In our approach, the quantum computer solves the master problem, which involves only the integer variables from the original energy system optimization problem. The subproblem includes the continuous variables and is solved by a classical computer. For better performance, we apply improvement techniques to the Benders decomposition. We test the approach on a case study to design a cost-optimal multi-energy system. While we provide a proof of concept that our Benders decomposition approach is applicable for the design of multi-energy systems, the computational time is still higher than for approaches using classical computers only. We therefore estimate the potential improvement of our approach to be expected for larger and fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We propose an estimation procedure for $d$-dimensional unitary transformations. For $d&gt;2$, the unitary transformations close to the identity are estimated saturating the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. For $d=2$, the estimation of all unitary transformations is also optimal with some prior information. We show through numerical simulations that, even in the absence of prior information, two-dimensional unitary transformations can be estimated with greater precision than by means of standard quantum process tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of optical properties of large atomic system, a weak laser driving is often assumed to simplify the system dynamics by linearly coupled equations. Here, we investigate the light scattering properties of atomic ensembles beyond weak-field excitation through the cumulant expansion method. By progressively incorporating higher-order correlations into the steady-state equations, an enhanced accuracy can be achieved in comparison to the exact solutions from solving a full density matrix. Our analysis reveals that, in the regime of weak dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), the first-order expansion yields satisfactory predictions for optical depth, while denser atomic configurations necessitate consideration of higher-order correlations. As the intensity of incident light increases, atom saturation effects become noticeable, giving rise to significant changes in light transparency, energy shift, and decay rate. This saturation phenomenon extends to subradiant atom arrays even under weak driving conditions, leading to substantial deviations from the linear model. Our findings demonstrate the mean-field models as good extensions to linear models as it balances both accuracy and computational complexity. However, the crucial role of higher-order cumulants in large and dense atom systems remains unclear, since it is challenging theoretically owing to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space in such light-matter interacting systems.</description>

Specifically, we examine the system when expressed in terms of commutative variables, utilizing a generalized form of the standard Bopp-shift relations recently introduced in [2]. We solved the time dependent system and obtained the analytical form of the eigenfunction using the method of Lewis invariants, which is associated with the Ermakov-Pinney equation, a non-linear differential equation. We then obtain exact analytical solution set for the Ermakov-Pinney equation. With these solutions in place, we move on to compute the dynamics of the energy expectation value analytically and explore their graphical representations for various solution sets of the Ermakov-Pinney equation, associated with a particular choice of quantum number. Finally, we determined the generalized form of the uncertainty equality relations among the operators for both commutative and noncommutative cases. Expectedly, our study is consistent with the findings in [1], specifically in a particular limit where the coordinate mapping relations reduce to the standard Bopp-shift relations.</description>

      <title>Collective photon emission in solid state environments: Concatenating non-markovian and markovian dynamics</title>

Abstract: Collective light emission and multi-qubit dynamics of solid-state quantum emitters are affected both by their coupling to the light field and to lattice vibrations. The effect of phonons on quantum emitters is twofold: polaron formation is described by ultrafast non-markovian dynamics, while slower dephasing is well described by exponential decay. Of the two temperature-dependent processes, the effect of the former on the collective emission and the entanglement decay of emitters is usually not modeled, and also the latter is sometimes neglected. Here we propose and compare two methods that are efficient also for several emitters: the first method concatenates the fast and slow phonon dynamics, and the second is the polaron method. For a single quantum emitter, we show that the dynamical equations are identical in both methods, while predictions for two or more emitters also agree very well. Both of our methods incorporate non-markovian dynamics due to phonons demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of the collective photon emission. Utilizing a simplified markovian model instead may not be accurate enough especially for quantum information applications: for example, we show how the markovian model may considerably overestimate the two-emitter concurrence, except at very low temperatures. Our concatenation and polaron methods can be applied to an arbitrary number and type of quantum emitters, and beyond the bulk GaAs environment that we consider here. Especially the concatenation method can take phonon effects into account at the same computational cost as modelling the emitter-photon interaction alone. Finally, we present approximate analytical expressions for the collective emission spectrum for $N$ emitters on a one-dimensional chain.</description>

      <title>Identification of a natural fieldlike entanglement resource in trapped-ion chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic trapping of ion chains can be regarded as a process of non-trivial entangled quantum state preparation within Hilbert spaces of the local axial motional modes. To begin uncovering properties of this entanglement resource produced as a byproduct of conventional ion-trap quantum information processing, the quantum continuous-variable formalism is herein utilized to focus on the leading-order entangled ground state of local motional modes in the presence of a quadratic trapping potential. The decay of entanglement between disjoint subsets of local modes is found to exhibit features of entanglement structure and responses to partial measurement reminiscent of the free massless scalar field vacuum. With significant fidelities between the two, even for large system sizes, a framework is established for initializing quantum field simulations via "imaging" extended entangled states from natural sources, rather than building correlations through deep circuits of few-body entangling operators. By calculating probabilities in discrete Fock subspaces of the local motional modes, considerations are presented for locally transferring these pre-distributed entanglement resources to the qudits of ion internal energy levels, improving this procedure's anticipated experimental viability.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of entangled subspaces: completely entangled subspaces of entanglement depth $k$ ($k$-CESs). These are subspaces of multipartite Hilbert spaces containing only pure states with an entanglement depth of at least $k$. We present an efficient construction of $k$-CESs of any achievable dimensionality in any multipartite scenario. Further, we discuss the relation between these subspaces and unextendible product bases (UPBs). In particular, we establish that there is a non-trivial bound on the cardinality of a UPB whose orthocomplement is a $k$-CES. Further, we discuss the existence of such UPBs for qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Digital Quantum Simulation in the Low-Energy Subspace: Applications and a Lower Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation has broad applications in approximating unitary evolution of Hamiltonians. In practice, many simulation tasks for quantum systems focus on quantum states in the low-energy subspace instead of the entire Hilbert space. In this paper, we systematically investigate the complexity of digital quantum simulation based on product formulas in the low-energy subspace. We show that the simulation error depends on the effective low-energy norm of the Hamiltonian for a variety of digital quantum simulation algorithms and quantum systems, allowing improvements over the previous complexities for full unitary simulations even for imperfect state preparations {due to thermalization}. In particular, for simulating spin models in the low-energy subspace, we prove that randomized product formulas such as qDRIFT and random permutation require smaller Trotter numbers. Such improvement also persists in symmetry-protected digital quantum simulations. We prove a similar improvement in simulating the dynamics of power-law quantum interactions. We also provide a query lower bound for general digital quantum simulations in the low-energy subspace.</description>

Abstract: The telecloning protocol distributes quantum states from a single sender to multiple receivers via a shared entangled state by exploiting the notions of teleportation and approximate cloning. We investigate the optimal telecloning fidelities obtained using both Gaussian and non-Gaussian shared resources. When the shared non-Gaussian state is created by subtracting photons from both the modes of the Gaussian two-mode squeezed vacuum state, we demonstrate that higher telecloning fidelities can be achieved in comparison with its Gaussian counterpart. To quantify this advantage, we introduce a quadrature-based nonclassicality measure, which is capable of estimating the fidelity of the clones, both with Gaussian and non-Gaussian resource states. We further provide a linear optical setup for asymmetric telecloning of continuous variable states using a multimode entangled state.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Coherence Scale of Linear Combinations of Gaussian Functions in Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadrature coherence scale (QCS) is a recently introduced measure that was shown to be an efficient witness of nonclassicality. It takes a simple form for pure and Gaussian states, but a general expression for mixed states tends to be prohibitively unwieldy. In this paper, we introduce a method for computing the quadrature coherence scale of quantum states characterized by Wigner functions expressible as linear combinations of Gaussian functions. Notable examples within this framework include cat states, GKP states, and states resulting from Gaussian transformations, measurements, and breeding protocols. In particular, we show that the quadrature coherence scale serves as a valuable tool for examining the scalability of nonclassicality in the presence of loss. Our findings lead us to put forth a conjecture suggesting that, subject to 50% loss or more, all pure states lose any QCS-certifiable nonclassicality. We also consider the quadrature coherence scale as a measure of quality of the output state of the breeding protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics `scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show the fault-tolerance of the not-so-well known [[8,1,4]] non-CSS code and study the logical error rates of the code.
  To do so, we adopt the procedure of the bare ancilla method presented by Brown et al.
  We choose the encoding procedure for stabilizer codes given by Gottesman and modify it to suit the setting of a class of non-CSS codes.
  We consider two types of noise models for this study, namely the depolarizing noise and anisotropic noise to depict the logical error rates obtained in decoding.</description>

      <title>Stimulated emission tomography for efficient characterization of spatial entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique of stimulated emission tomography (SET) provides excellent characterization of SPDC sources of bi-photon states since it increases the average number of photons detected by several orders of magnitude than the traditional coincidence counting method. In a SET experiment, the signal caused by the vacuum fluctuation in SPDC is replaced by a more intense prepared seed with the same mode properties, resulting in an amplification of the corresponding idler. Based on this idea, our experiment uses the difference frequency generation (DFG), a purely classical second-order nonlinear process, to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) spectrum of an entangled photon pair produced by a Type-II SPDC crystal. We inject the seed beam at 780 nm with different Laguerre-Gaussian modes together with a pump beam at 405 nm into a Type-II BBO crystal and measure the Laguerre-Gaussian mode distribution of the idler at 842 nm. We observe a strong idler production and good agreement with the theoretical prediction of the OAM spectrum. We expect that this experiment paves the way for the efficient measurement of bi-photon wavefunctions produced by ultra-thin SPDC sources and also the characterization of high-dimensional entangled photon pairs produced in SPDC.</description>

Abstract: We investigate imaginary gap-closed (IGC) points and their associated dynamics in dissipative systems. In a general non-Hermitian model, we derive the equation governing the IGC points of the energy spectrum, establishing that these points are only determined by the Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. Focusing on a class of one-dimensional dissipative chains, we explore quantum walks across different scenarios and various parameters, showing that IGC points induce a power-law decay scaling in bulk loss probability and trigger a boundary phenomenon referred to as "edge burst". This observation underscores the crucial role of IGC points under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in shaping quantum walk dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the damping matrices of these dissipative chains under PBCs possess Liouvillian gapless points, implying an algebraic convergence towards the steady state in long-time dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum behavior of the electromagnetic field in unbounded macroscopic media displaying absorption is properly described by the Langevin noise formalism (macroscopic quantum electrodynamics) where the field is assumed to be entirely produced by medium fluctuating sources via the dyadic Green's function. On the other hand, such formalism is able to deal with the case of finite-size lossy objects placed in vacuum only as a limiting situation where the permittivity limit ${\rm Im} ( \varepsilon) \rightarrow 0^+$ pertaining the regions filled by vacuum is taken at the end of the calculations. Strictly setting ${\rm Im} ( \varepsilon) =0$ is forbidden in the Langevin noise formalism since the field would vanish in the lossless regions and this is physically due to the fact that the contribution of the scattering modes to the field is not separated from the contribution produced by the medium fluctuating sources. Recently, a modified Langevin noise formalism has been proposed to encompass the scattering modes and accordingly it is able to describe the structured lossless situations by strictly setting ${\rm Im} (\varepsilon) = 0$. However such modified formalism has been numerically validated only in few specific geometries. In this paper we analytically derive the modified Langevin noise formalism from the established canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in macroscopic media, thus proving that it models any possible scenario involving linear, inhomegeneous and magnetodielectric samples. The derivation starts from quantum Maxwell equations in the Heisenberg picture together with their formal solution as the superposition of the medium assisted field and the scattering modes. We analytically prove that each of the two field parts can be expressed in term of particular bosonic operators, which in turn diagonalize the electromagnetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains: exact analytics, distributions and tight approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We generalize this approaches as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times -- allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate when the distributed entanglement is used for quantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. In follow-up work we exploit a connection to a model in statistical physics to numerically calculate quantities of interest for the inhomogeneous multipartite case.</description>

Abstract: We present a tapered Paul trap whose radio frequency electrodes are inclined to the symmetric axis of the endcap electrodes, resulting in a funnel-shaped trapping potential. With this configuration, a charged particle confined in this trap has its radial degrees of freedom coupled to that of the axial direction. The same design was successfully used to experimentally realize a single-atom heat engine, and with this setup amplification of zeptonewton forces was implemented. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and characterization of such an ion trap in detail. This system offers a high level of control over the ion's motion. Its novel features promise applications in the field of quantum thermodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of lattice gauge theories on noisy quantum hardware inherently suffer from violations of the gauge symmetry due to coherent and incoherent errors of the underlying physical system that implements the simulation. These gauge violations cause the simulations to become unphysical requiring the result of the simulation to be discarded. We investigate an active correction scheme that relies on detecting gauge violations locally and subsequently correcting them by dissipatively driving the system back into the physical gauge sector. We show that the correction scheme not only ensures the protection of the gauge symmetry, but it also leads to a longer validity of the simulation results even within the gauge-invariant sector. Finally, we discuss further applications of the scheme such as preparation of the many-body ground state of the simulated system.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling laws for correlated decay of many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems are open, continually exchanging energy and information with the surrounding environment. This interaction leads to decoherence and decay of quantum states. In complex systems, formed by many particles, decay can become correlated and enhanced. A fundamental question then arises: what is the maximal decay rate of a large quantum system, and how does it scale with its size? In this work, we address these issues by reformulating the problem into finding the ground state energy of a generic spin Hamiltonian. Inspired by recent work in Hamiltonian complexity theory, we establish rigorous and general upper and lower bounds on the maximal decay rate. These bounds are universal, as they hold for a broad class of Markovian many-body quantum systems. For many physically-relevant systems, the bounds are asymptotically tight, resulting in exact scaling laws with system size. Specifically, for large atomic arrays in free space, these scalings depend only on the arrays' dimensionality and are insensitive to details at short length-scales. The scaling laws establish fundamental limits on the decay rates of quantum states and offer valuable insights for research in many-body quantum dynamics, metrology, and fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Rapid separation of linear crystals of trapped ions into different subsets is critical for realizing trapped ion quantum computing architectures where ions are rearranged in trap arrays to achieve all-to-all connectivity between qubits. We introduce a general theoretical framework that can be used to describe the separation of same-species and mixed-species crystals into smaller subsets. The framework relies on an efficient description of the evolution of Gaussian motional states under quadratic Hamiltonians that only requires a special solution of the classical equations of motion of the ions to describe their quantum evolution under the influence of a time-dependent applied potential and the ions' mutual Coulomb repulsion. We provide time-dependent applied potentials suitable for separation of a mixed species three-ion crystal on timescales similar to that of free expansion driven by Coulomb repulsion, with all modes along the crystal axis starting and ending close to their ground states. Three separately-confined mixed species ions can be combined into a crystal held in a single well without energy gain by time-reversal of this separation process.</description>

      <title>Computational Fluid Dynamics on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QubitSolve is working on a quantum solution for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We have created a variational quantum CFD (VQCFD) algorithm and a 2D Software Prototype based on it. By testing the Software Prototype on a quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the partial differential equations that underlie CFD can be solved using quantum computers. We aim to determine whether a quantum advantage can be achieved with VQCFD. To do this, we compare the performance of VQCFD with classical CFD using performance models. The quantum performance model uses data from VQCFD circuits run on quantum computers. We define a key performance parameter Q_{5E7}, the ratio of quantum to classical simulation time for a size relevant to industrial simulations. Given the current state of the Software Prototype and the limited computing resources available, we can only estimate an upper bound for Q_{5E7}. While the estimated Q_{5E7} shows that the algorithm's implementation must improve significantly, we have identified several innovative techniques that could reduce it sufficiently to achieve a quantum advantage. In the next phase of development, we will develop a 3D minimum-viable product and implement those techniques.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle Duality in the Negative Information Sea</title>

Abstract: Quantum theory reveals astonishing and counterintuitive phenomena not found in classical physics, such as wave-particle duality, where entities like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behaviors. In this paper, we leverage advancements in quantum information science to gain new insights into this phenomenon. We specifically examine negative conditional entropy in quantum entanglement, where the selection of the measurement basis appears to ripple backward in time, akin to Dirac's model of an infinite sea of negative energy states filled with electrons, where holes in this sea appear as positrons. We propose that an observer's knowledge of the measurement choice, analogous to a hole in the negative information sea, corresponds to the wave aspect of the system, while the classical outcome aligns with its particle nature. This exploration of the relationship between microscopic quantum phenomena and macroscopic observations offers new perspectives on the mind-matter duality.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Arrow of Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that time's arrow is naturally induced by quantum mechanical evolution, whenever the systems have a very large number ${\cal N}$ of non-degenerate states and a Hamiltonian bounded from below. When ${\cal N}$ is finite, the arrow is imperfect, since evolution can resurrect past states. In the limit ${\cal N} \rightarrow \infty$ the arrow is fixed by the "tooth of time": the decay of excited states induced by {\it spontaneous emission} to the ground state, mediated by interactions and a large number of decay products which carry energy and information to infinity. This applies to individual isolated atoms, and does not require a coupling to a separate large heath bath.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in driven atomic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study driven atomic Josephson junctions realized by coupling two two-dimensional atomic clouds with a tunneling barrier. By moving the barrier at a constant velocity, dc and ac Josephson regimes are characterized by a zero and nonzero atomic density difference across the junction, respectively. Here, we monitor the dynamics resulting in the system when, in addition to the above constant velocity protocol, the position of the barrier is periodically driven. We demonstrate that the time-averaged particle imbalance features a step-like behavior that is the analog of Shapiro steps observed in driven superconducting Josephson junctions. The underlying dynamics reveals an intriguing interplay of the vortex and phonon excitations, where Shapiro steps are induced via suppression of vortex growth. We study the system with a classical-field dynamics method, and benchmark our findings with a driven circuit dynamics.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the quantum Mpemba effect in integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly complicated nature of far from equilibrium systems can lead to a complete breakdown of the physical intuition developed in equilibrium. A famous example of this is the Mpemba effect, which states that non-equilibrium states may relax faster when they are further from equilibrium or, put another way, hot water can freeze faster than warm water. Despite possessing a storied history, the precise criteria and mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are still not known. Here we study a quantum version of the Mpemba effect that takes place in closed many body systems with a U(1) conserved charge: in certain cases a more asymmetric initial configuration relaxes and restores the symmetry faster than a more symmetric one. In contrast to the classical case, we establish the criteria for this to occur in arbitrary integrable quantum systems using the recently introduced entanglement asymmetry. We describe the quantum Mpemba effect in such systems and relate properties of the initial state, specifically its charge fluctuations, to the criteria for its occurrence. These criteria are expounded using exact analytic and numerical techniques in several examples, a free fermion model, the Rule 54 cellular automaton, and the Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

Abstract: We study whether the probability distribution of a discrete quantum walk can get arbitrarily close to uniform, given that the walk starts with a uniform superposition of the outgoing arcs of some vertex. We establish a characterization of this phenomenon on regular non-bipartite graphs in terms of their adjacency eigenvalues and eigenprojections. Using theory from association schemes, we show this phenomenon happens on a strongly regular graph $X$ if and only if $X$ or $\overline{X}$ has parameters $(4m^2, 2m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m)$ where $m\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Tensor network influence functionals in the continuous-time limit: connections to quantum embedding, bath discretization, and higher-order time propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two developments of tensor network influence functionals (in particular, influence functional matrix product states (IF-MPS)) for quantum impurity dynamics within the fermionic setting of the Anderson impurity model. The first provides the correct extension of the IF-MPS to continuous time by introducing a related mathematical object, the boundary influence functional MPS. The second connects the dynamics described by a compressed IF-MPS to that of a quantum embedding method with a time-dependent effective bath undergoing nonunitary dynamics. Using these concepts, we implement higher-order time propagators for the quench dynamics of the Anderson impurity model within the boundary IF-MPS formalism. The calculations illustrate the ability of the current formulation to efficiently remove the time step error in standard discrete-time IF-MPS implementations as well as to interface with state vector propagation techniques. They also show the advantages of IF-MPS dynamics, with its associated highly compact effective bath dynamics, over state vector propagation with a static bath discretization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <title>Phase driven unconventional superradiance phase transition in non-Hermitian cascaded quantum Rabi cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates phase-driven symmetry breaking leading to superradiance phase transitions in cascaded non-Hermitian quantum Rabi cavities. Non-Hermiticity is introduced via the phase coupling $\varphi$ between the atom and the optical field. In the thermodynamic limit of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we analytically derive the superradiance phase boundary, validated by observables. An unconventional quantum phase transition without a Hermitian analogue arises when $|\varphi|=\frac{\pi}{4}$ or $|\varphi|=\frac{3\pi}{4}$, where the phase boundary is uniquely determined by the cavity coupling, at $\mathcal{J}=\frac{1}{2}$, independent of the atom-photon coupling strength $g$. For other $\varphi$, the phase boundary relies on both $\mathcal{J}$ and $g$, similar to the scenario observed in Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we identify phase-driven first- and second-order superradiance phase transitions, focusing on the quantum criticality of the second-order transition by determining the critical exponents and the universality class. The feasibility of experimental realization is also discussed, aiming to inspire further studies on non-Hermitian superradiance quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>
