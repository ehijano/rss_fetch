      <title>Conformal field theory of Gaussian free fields in a multiply connected domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a version of conformal field theory (CFT) that gives a connection to SLE in a multiply connected domain. Our approach is based on the Gaussian free field and applies to CFTs with central charge $c \leq 1$. In this framework we introduce the generalized Eguchi-Ooguri equations and use them to derive the explicit form of Ward's equations, which describe the insertion of a stress tensor in terms of Lie derivatives and differential operators depending on the Teicm\"{u}ller modular parameters. Furthermore, by implementing the BPZ equations, we provide a conformal field theoretic realization of an SLE in a multiply connected domain, which in particular suggests its drift function, and construct a class of martingale observables for this SLE process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant vanishing results regarding anomalies.</description>

      <title>On integrability of a new dynamical system associated with the BBM-type hydrodynamic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the exceptional integrability property of a family of higher-order Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM)-type nonlinear dispersive equations. Here, we highlight its deep relationship with a generalized infinite hierarchy of the integrable Riemann-type hydrodynamic equations. A previous Lie symmetry analysis revealed a particular case which was conjectured to be integrable. Namely, a Lie-Baecklund symmetry exists, thus highlighting another associated dynamical system. Here, we investigate these two equations using the gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Moreover, we construct their infinite hierarchy of conservation laws analytically, using three compatible Poisson structures to prove the complete integrability of both dynamical systems. We investigate these two equations using the so-called gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Based on this scheme, applied to the equation under consideration, we have analytically constructed its infinite hierarchy of conservation laws, derived two compatible Poisson structures and proved its complete integrability.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the Abel--Prym map in presence of an additional involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike Abel map of the symmetric power of a Riemann surface onto its Jacobian, the Abel--Prym map generically can not be reversed by means of conventional technique related to the Jacobi inversion problem, and of its main ingredient, namely the Riemann vanishing theorem. It happens because the corresponding analog of the Riemann vanishing theorem gives twice as many points as the dimension of the Prym variety. However, if the Riemann surface has a second involution commuting with the one defining the Prym variety and satisfying a certain additional condition, an analog of the Jacobi inversion can be defined, and expressed in terms of the Prym theta function. We formulate these conditions and refer to the pairs of involutions satisfying them as to pairs of the first type. We formulate necessary conditions for the pair of involutions to be a pair of the first type, and give a series of examples of curves with such pairs of involutions, mainly spectral curves of Hitchin systems, and also a spectral curve of the Kovalewski system.</description>

      <title>Quantum information recast via multiresolution in $L_2(0,1]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiresolution approach to the theory of quantum information. It arose from an effort to develop a systematic mathematical approach to the analysis of an infinite array of qubits, i.e., a structure that may be interpreted as a quantum metamaterial. Foundational to our approach are two mathematical constructions with classical roots: the Borel isomorphism and the Haar basis. Here, these constructions are intertwined to establish an identification between $L_2(0,1]$ and the Hilbert space of an infinite array of qubits and to enable analysis of operators that act on arrays of qubits (either finite or infinite). The fusion of these two concepts empowers us to represent quantum operations and observables through geometric operators. As an unexpected upshot, we observe that the fundamental concept of calculus is inherent in an infinite array of qubits; indeed, the antiderivative arises as a natural and indispensable operator in this context.</description>

      <title>Quantized area of the Schwarzschild black hole: A non-hermitian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work our aim is to link Bekenstein's quantized form of the area of the event horizon to the Hamiltonian of the non-Hermitian Swanson oscillator which is known to be parity-time-symmetric. We achieve this by employing a similarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a scaled harmonics oscillator. To this end, we consider the unconstrained reduced Hamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and implies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the asymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature. This leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the harmonic oscillator levels. Next, in the framework of the Swanson oscillator model, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the corresponding Hawking temperature and black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Gluing invariants of Donaldson--Thomas type -- Part I: the Darboux stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a (-1)-shifted symplectic derived Deligne--Mumford stack. In this paper we introduce the Darboux stack of $X$, parametrizing local presentations of $X$ as a derived critical locus of a function $f$ on a smooth formal scheme $U$. Local invariants such as the Milnor number $\mu_f$, the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles $\mathsf{P}_{U,f}$ and the category of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ are naturally defined on the Darboux stack, without ambiguity. The stack of non-degenerate flat quadratic bundles acts on the Darboux stack and our main theorem is the contractibility of the quotient stack when taking a further homotopy quotient identifying isotopic automorphisms. As a corollary we recover the gluing results for vanishing cycles by Brav--Bussi--Dupont--Joyce--Szendr\H oi. In a second part (to appear), we will apply this general mechanism to glue the motives of the locally defined categories of matrix factorizations $\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ under the prescription of additional orientation data, thus answering positively conjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.</description>

      <title>The XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.</description>

      <title>Analytic trajectory bootstrap for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ two-matrix model with $\text{Tr}[A,B]^2$ interaction and quartic potentials by the analytic trajectory bootstrap, where $A$ and $B$ represent the two matrices. In the large $N$ limit, we can focus on the single trace moments associated with the words composed of the letters $A$ and $B$. Analytic continuations in the lengths of the words and subwords lead to analytic trajectories of single trace moments and intriguing intersections of different trajectories. Inspired by the one-cut solutions of one-matrix models, we propose some simple ansatzes for the singularity structure of the two-matrix generating functions and the corresponding single trace moments. Together with the self-consistent constraints from the loop equations, we determine the free parameters in the ansatzes and obtain highly accurate solutions for the two-matrix model at a low computational cost. For a given length cutoff $L_\text{max}$, our results are within and more accurate than the positivity bounds from the relaxation method, such as about 6-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=18$. The convergence pattern suggests that we achieve about $8$-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=22$. As the singularity structure is closely related to the eigenvalue distributions, we further present the results for various types of eigenvalue densities. In the end, we study the symmetry breaking solutions using more complicated ansatzes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formalism of systematic construction of integrable non-autonomous deformations of soliton hierarchies is presented. The theory is formulated as an initial value problem (IVP) for an associated Frobenius integrability condition on a Lie algebra. It is showed that this IVP has a formal solution and within the framewrok of two particular subalgebras of the hereditary Lie algebra the explicit forms of this formal solution are presented. Finally, this formalism is applied to Korteveg-de Vries, dispersive water waves and Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur soliton hierarchies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Landau-Coulomb equation and show an explicit blow-down mechanism for a family of initial data that are small-scale, supercritical perturbations of a Maxwellian function. We establish global well-posedness and show that the initial bump region will disappear in a time of order one. We prove that the function remains close to an explicit function during the blow-down. As a consequence, our result shows exponential decay in time of the solution towards equilibrium. The key ingredients of our proof are the explicit blow-down function and a novel two-scale linearization in appropriate time-dependent spaces that yields uniform estimates in the perturbation parameter.</description>

On the way we obtain new formulas and in particular we calculate explicitely some non local terms and logarithmic terms appearing in the Steklov heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of the HOMFLY polynomial for bipartite knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence via Stability and Applications to Holant-Type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper formalizes connections between stability of polynomials and convergence rates of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We prove that if a (multivariate) partition function is nonzero in a region around a real point $\lambda$ then spectral independence holds at $\lambda$. As a consequence, for Holant-type problems (e.g., spin systems) on bounded-degree graphs, we obtain optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing time bounds for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics. Our result significantly improves the running time guarantees obtained via the polynomial interpolation method of Barvinok (2017), refined by Patel and Regts (2017).
  There are a variety of applications of our results. In this paper, we focus on Holant-type (i.e., edge-coloring) problems, including weighted edge covers and weighted even subgraphs. For the weighted edge cover problem (and several natural generalizations) we obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm on bounded-degree graphs. The even subgraphs problem corresponds to the high-temperature expansion of the ferromagnetic Ising model. We obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Ising model with a nonzero external field on bounded-degree graphs, which improves upon the classical result of Jerrum and Sinclair (1993) for this class of graphs. We obtain further applications to antiferromagnetic two-spin models on line graphs, weighted graph homomorphisms, tensor networks, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a relationship between conformally invariant boundary conditions and anomalies of conformal field theories (CFTs) in 1+1 dimensions. For a given CFT with a global symmetry, we consider symmetric gapping potentials which are relevant perturbations to the CFT. If a gapping potential is introduced only in a subregion of the system, it provides a certain boundary condition to the CFT. From this equivalence, if there exists a Cardy boundary state which is invariant under a symmetry, then the CFT can be gapped with a unique ground state by adding the corresponding gapping potential. This means that the symmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we systematically deduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several different symmetries. They include the free compact boson theory, Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and unitary minimal models. When the symmetry of the CFT is anomalous, it implies a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type ingappability of the system. Our results are consistent with, where available, known results in the literature. Moreover, we extend the discussion to other symmetries including spin groups and generalized time-reversal symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Non-cutoff Boltzmann Equation in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial-boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we study the stability and long-time dynamics of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian without angular cutoff assumption in a general $C^3$ bounded domain $\Omega$ (including convex and non-convex cases) with physical boundary conditions: inflow and Maxwell-reflection (including diffuse reflection) boundary conditions. We obtain the global-in-time existence, which has an exponential decay rate for the inflow boundary for both hard and soft potentials, and for the Maxwell-reflection boundary for hard potentials. The crucial method is to extend the boundary problem in a bounded domain to the whole space without regular velocity dissipation, followed by an improved De Giorgi iteration with a large iteration constant and the $L^2$--$L^\infty$ method.</description>

      <title>Featurizing Koopman Mode Decomposition For Robust Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses delay embedding and a learned Mahalanobis distance to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The delay embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis distance adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional linear oscillator, a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor that is partially observed, and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation mechanism of quasihalo orbit from Lissajous orbit in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general analytical method to describe the center manifolds of collinear libration points in the Restricted Three-body Problem (RTBP). It is well-known that these center manifolds include Lissajous orbits, halo orbits, and quasihalo orbits. Previous studies have traditionally treated these orbits separately by iteratively constructing high-order series solutions using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. Instead of relying on resonance between their frequencies, this study identifies that halo and quasihalo orbits arise due to intricate coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane motions. To characterize this coupling effect, a novel concept, coupling coefficient $\eta$, is introduced in the RTBP, incorporating the coupling term $\eta \Delta x$ in the $z$-direction dynamics equation, where $\Delta$ represents a formal power series concerning the amplitudes. Subsequently, a uniform series solution for these orbits is constructed up to a specified order using the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method. For any given paired in-plane and out-of-plane amplitudes, the coupling coefficient $\eta$ is determined by the bifurcation equation $\Delta = 0$. When $\eta$ = 0, the proposed solution describes Lissajous orbits around libration points. As $\eta$ transitions from zero to non-zero values, the solution describes quasihalo orbits, which bifurcate from Lissajous orbits. Particularly, halo orbits bifurcate from planar Lyapunov orbits if the out-of-plane amplitude is zero. The proposed method provides a unified framework for understanding these intricate orbital behaviors in the RTBP.</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <title>A uniform trigonometric R-matrix for the exceptional series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a uniform trigonometric $R$-matrix for the adjoint representations on the exceptional series. The exceptional series is a finite list of points on a projective line with a simple Lie algebra attached to each point. This list of Lie algebras includes the five exceptional Lie algebras. For $L$ a simple Lie algebra there is a rational $R$-matrix in $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ which has a quantum deformation to a trigonometric $R$-matrix. We construct a sixteen dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{2})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ and a 287 dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{3})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^3(L\oplus I))$. Then we construct an $R$-matrix in $A^\square(\mathit{2})$ which satisfies the Yang--Baxter equation in $A^\square(\mathit{3})$ and which interpolates the trigonometric $R$-matrices for the points in the exceptional series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new generalized family of infinite-dimensional $ \widetilde{W} $ algebras, each associated with a particular element of a commutative subalgebra of the $ W_{1+\infty} $ algebra, was described. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the aforementioned association, accompanied by the requisite proofs and illustrative examples. This approach allows a derivation of Ward identities for selected WLZZ matrix models and the expansion of corresponding $ W $-operators in terms of an infinite set of variables $ p_k $.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain two applications in different directions of algebra/algebraic geometry.
  The first application is a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  The second application is a commutativity criterion for operators in the Weyl algebra or, more generally, in the ring of ordinary differential operators, which we prove in the case when operators have a normal form with the restriction top line (for details see Introduction).
  Both applications are obtained with the help of normal forms. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a restricted finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Kink-kink solutions in BPS impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that BPS-impurity theories may support BPS kink-kink solutions i.e., an energetically degenerated family of solutions describing two kinks at any mutual distance. This requires a singular impurity. As an example we consider the sine-Gordon and $\phi^6$ models coupled with such a BPS impurity. Interestingly, obtained solutions are identical to double sine-Gordon kinks and Christ-Lee kinks respectively.
  We also study the spectral flow on the moduli space. All the modes have an odd number of nodes to cancel the singularity of the impurity.</description>

      <title>Approximate Unitary $k$-Designs from Shallow, Low-Communication Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are useful in quantum information and related fields but hard to generate with limited resources. An approximate unitary $k$-design is an ensemble of unitaries and measure over which the average is close to a Haar (uniformly) random ensemble up to the first $k$ moments. A particularly strong notion of approximation bounds the distance from Haar randomness in relative error: the approximate design can be written as a convex combination involving an exact design and vice versa. We construct multiplicative-error approximate unitary $k$-design ensembles for which communication between subsystems is $O(1)$ in the system size. These constructions use the alternating projection method to analyze overlapping Haar twirls, giving a bound on the convergence speed to the full twirl with respect to the $2$-norm. Using von Neumann subalgebra indices to replace system dimension, the 2-norm distance converts to relative error without introducing any additional dimension dependence. Via recursion on these constructions, we construct a scheme yielding relative error designs in $O \big ( (k \log k + \log m + \log(1/\epsilon) ) k\, \text{polylog}(k) \big )$ depth, where $m$ is the number of qudits in the complete system and $\epsilon$ the approximation error. This sublinear depth construction answers one variant of [Harrow and Mehraban 2023, Open Problem 1]. Moreover, entanglement generated by the sublinear depth scheme follows area laws on spatial lattices up to corrections logarithmic in the full system size.</description>
