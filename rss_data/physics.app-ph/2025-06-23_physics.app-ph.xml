      <title>Unveiling Nano-scale Crystal Deformation using Coherent X-ray Dynamical Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based Artificial Intelligence method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum current source on commercial 22-nm CMOS process technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum effects in nanoscopic devices has in the past mostly been accessible through academic cleanrooms and research foundries. Opening the quantum frontier for wider industrial applications likely requires the scale of well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries for manufacturing transistor-based quantum devices operable above subkelvin temperatures. Here, we operate a commercial 22-nm-node fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS device as dual parallel-connected charge-pumps for the implementation of a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure the accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A for this scalable architecture at 50 MHz with reference to SI-traceable voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. Looking ahead we propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel-connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This can be operated as a table-top primary standard, generating quantum currents up to microampere levels.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Cost of Harvesting the Solar Infrared Tail in Space-Based Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space applications require the highest performing photovoltaic devices. Typically these are multi-junction devices that are capable of converting a larger bandwidth of the solar spectrum. However, the conversion of longer wavelength photons in the solar infrared tail results in a disproportionate increase in generated heat per watt of electricity, and since devices have limited heat rejection in space, this excess heat raises the operating temperature, lowering the efficiency of the entire device. Here we show that space-based photovoltaics should avoid converting the solar infrared tail past an optimum terminal cutoff wavelength, and that this will lead to higher electrical output. In addition, a lower operating temperature may lead to higher end-of-life power outputs.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric-Metal Phononic Crystal Enabling GHz Tunable Ultrahigh $Q$ Quasi-BIC mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of GHz-frequency, high quality factor ($Q$), and electrically tunable acoustic resonators holds significant potential for advancing applications in quantum information technologies, microwave photonics, and reconfigurable RF systems. However, simultaneously achieving these three characteristics within a single, scalable platform remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a GHz quasi-BIC resonator in a piezoelectric thin-film shear horizontal (SH) wave system, achieved through a structurally simple piezoelectric-metal phononic crystal (PnC) architecture on a LiNbO$_3$ thin film. This approach enables leaky Fabry-Perot coupling mode and localized trapping quasi-BIC mode. Without the need for deep etching or intricate patterning, we achieve a room-temperature quality factor of $6\times 10^4$ at ~1 GHz in ambient air, corresponding to an $f * Q$ product of $6*\times 10^{13}$ at quasi-BIC mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient electrical tunability via low-voltage (0.6 V) electrothermal modulation of the PnC structure, enabling a reversible transition between trapped and transmission states and yielding a high-contrast amplitude modulation of 47.75 dB. Our results establish a lithography-friendly, fabrication-tolerant platform for realizing tunable, high-$Q$ acoustic resonators at GHz frequencies, overcoming longstanding barriers in phononic device engineering. This work opens new directions for scalable on-chip phononic circuits in quantum acoustics, reconfigurable RF systems, and signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Light-Pulse Atom Interferometer: Two-Level Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of atomic interferometer is proposed, in which the traditional method of measuring the state of an atom is replaced by the technique of polarization spectroscopy using the working substance of a clot of condensate of two-level atoms. As a result, the atomic interferometer is freed from needing the above-mentioned multiple repetitions, while maintaining high sensitivity. The Kapitza-Dirac resonance diffraction is used to split the translational motion of the atom. Numerical computations to determine the rotated component of the probing field show that the ratio of the out-put signal to the input signal under normal conditions in a specialized laser physics laboratory using a clot of atomic condensate of alkali metals with a concentration of 10 in 11 power per cm cube and linear dimensions of the order of 1 micrometer as the working substance reaches quite respectable values.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy inference using HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $&lt;$0.07$\%$ and $&lt;$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. The forming-free, compliance-free operation, fast switching, low energy consumption, and high accuracy classification demonstrate the potential of HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$-based resistive memories for energy-efficient neural network acceleration and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Flips Reveal the Universal Impact of Memory on Random Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying space exploration is a central question in random walk theory, with direct applications ranging from animal foraging, diffusion-limited reactions, and intracellular transport to stock markets. In particular, the explored domain by one or many simple memoryless (or Markovian) random walks has received considerable attention . However, the physical systems mentioned above typically involve significant memory effects, and so far, no general framework exists to analyze such systems. We introduce the concept of a \emph{flip}, defined most naturally in one dimension, where the visited territory is $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$: a flip occurs when, after discovering a new site at $x_{\rm max}$, the walker next discovers $x_{\rm min} - 1$ instead of $x_{\rm max} + 1$ (and vice-versa).
  While it reduces to the classical splitting probability in Markovian systems, we show that the flip probability serves as a key observable for quantifying the impact of memory effects on space exploration.
  Here, we demonstrate that the flip probability follows a strikingly simple and universal law: it decays inversely with the number of sites visited, as \(1/n\), independently of the underlying stochastic process. We confirm this behavior through simulations across paradigmatic non-Markovian models and observe it in real-world systems, without relying on model assumptions, including biological tracer motion, DNA sequences, and financial market dynamics. Finally, we reveal the physical mechanism behind this universality and show how it extends to higher-dimensional and fractal domains. Our determination of universal flip statistics lay the groundwork for understanding how memory effects govern random explorations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Legendre Duality in Optimal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimality principles in nonequilibrium transport networks are linked to a thermodynamic formalism based on generalized transport potentials endowed with Legendre duality and related contact structure. This allows quantifying the distance from non-equilibrium operating points, analogously to thermodynamic availability as well as to shed light on optimality principles in relation to different imposed constraints. Extremizations of generalized dissipation and entropy production appear as special cases that require power-law resistances and -- for entropy production -- also isothermal conditions. Changes in stability of multiple operating points are interpreted as phase transitions based on non-equilibrium equations of state, while cost-based optimization of transport properties reveals connections to the generalized dissipation in the case of power law costs and linear resistance law, but now with typically unstable operating points which give rise to branched optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spin Waves in Curved Ferromagnetic Nanocaps of a 3D-printed Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent magnon modes in a truly three-dimensional (3D) magnonic crystal have not yet been investigated. This scientific gap exists despite the numerous theoretical predictions about miniband formation and edge modes with topological protection. Such properties are key to advance nanomagnonics for ultrafast data processing. In this work, we use a scalable nanotechnology and integrate a 3D magnonic crystal to an on-chip microresonator. It was fabricated by two-photon lithography of a 3D woodpile structure and atomic layer deposition of 30-nm-thick nickel. Operated near 14 and 24~GHz, the microresonator output revealed numerous coherent magnons with distinct angular dependencies reflecting the underlying face-centred cubic lattice. Micromagnetic simulations show that the edge modes are localised in curved nanocaps and robust against changes in field orientation. Along an edge, they exhibit an unexpected phase evolution. Our findings advance functional microwave circuits with 3D magnonic crystals and fuel their visionary prospects of edge-dominated magnon modes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Absorption in Thin-Film Silicon Solar Cells Using a Broadband Plasmonic Nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of a metal-dielectric-metal absorber that achieves strong absorption from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (near-IR) spectrum are presented. The proposed nanostructure consists of a periodic titanium (Ti) array as the top layer, a thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) spacer, and a continuous aluminum (Al) layer serving as the back reflector. Comprehensive optimization of structural parameters results in an average absorptance of 96% in the 280-1000 nm wavelength range. The proposed design exhibits polarization insensitivity and maintains high absorption efficiency under oblique incidence. Fabrication is carried out using electron beam lithography followed by a lift-off process, ensuring both high performance and manufacturing simplicity. Experimental measurements show strong agreement with numerical simulations, validating the effectiveness of the design. Furthermore, integration of the absorber into a thin-film silicon (Si) solar cell is analyzed, revealing significant enhancement in light absorption within the active layer. Owing to its broadband response, angular robustness, and structural simplicity, the proposed absorber shows strong potential for applications in solar energy harvesting, thermal emission, and advanced photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Slit-loaded coplanar waveguide for color-center spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin qubits of color centers are extensively investigated for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing, with their states generally controlled using lasers and microwaves. However, it is challenging to effectively irradiate both lasers and microwaves onto color centers using small footprint microwave waveguides or antennas that are compatible with semiconductor devices. We experimentally show that by introducing a compact coplanar waveguide with a thin slit in its signal line, effective irradiation of both lasers and microwaves is enabled, allowing spin-state control of color centers created around the slit. Microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, intrinsically generated by a standard coplanar waveguide, persist even after loading the slit, which is necessary to control the color centers whose spin quantization axes are oriented perpendicular to the surface, while laser light for the initialization and readout of spin states can access the color centers through the slit. Continuous and pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance measurements are performed for the silicon vacancies ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide 4H-SiC(0001). Experimental results indicate that the spin states of $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ are effectively controlled by the microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, which agrees with numerical results from electromagnetic field simulations. Our small footprint waveguide is suitable for integrating color-center-based quantum sensors into semiconductor electronic devices and other small-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Preferred Synthesis of Armchair SnS2 Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.</description>

Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Five devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, and polarization splitter rotator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory. We compare simulation accuracy, runtime, and transmission spectra across varying resolutions and bandwidths. Results reinforce that both solver are reliable with minimal discrepancies. Overall, Tidy3D is well suited for rapid prototyping while Lumerical FDTD remains a robust option for complex simulations.</description>

Abstract: AlN has the largest bandgap in the wurtzite III-nitride semiconductor family, making it an ideal barrier for a thin GaN channel to achieve strong carrier confinement in field-effect transistors, analogous to silicon-on-insulator technology. Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.</description>

      <title>Negative capacitance overcomes Schottky-gate limits in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors driven by Optical Pulling Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>

      <title>Role of hydrogen dynamics and deposition conditions in photochromic YHO/MoO$_3$ bilayer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.</description>

      <title>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Open-Path Methane Sensing via Backscattered Light in a Nonlinear Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interferometry has widespread applications in sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging. However, most implementations require highly reflective mirrors and precise optical alignment, drastically reducing their versatility and usability in outdoor applications. This work is based on stimulated parametric down conversion (ST-PDC), demonstrating methane absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared (MIR) region by detecting near-infrared (NIR) photons using a silicon-based CMOS camera. The MIR light, used to probe methane, is diffusely backscattered from a Lambertian surface, experiencing significant transmission loss. We implement a single-mode confocal illumination and collection scheme, using a two-lens system to mode-match the interfering beams to achieve background methane detection at a distance of 4.6 meters under a 60 dB loss. Our method is also extended to real-world surfaces, such as glass, brushed metal, and a leaf, showing robust background methane sensing with various target materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative correlation between structural (dis-)order and diffuseness of phase transition in lead scandium tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics show a phase transition to a paraelectric phase at a well-defined transition temperature. Introducing disorder makes this transition diffuse, and the system becomes a relaxor. Since the degree of (dis-)order is usually manipulated by varying the chemical composition, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between disorder and the degree of diffuseness. Perovskite structured lead scandium tantalate (Pb[Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$]O$_3$, PST) offers the opportunity to tune the character of the transition by thermal annealing without changing the stoichiometry. Here it is demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the structural ordering, quantified by the intensity ratio $S$ of the pseudocubic (111)/(200) x-ray diffraction peaks, and the diffuseness parameter $\gamma$ deduced from temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. The relation is universal, independent of whether the sample is a thin film, multilayer capacitor or bulk ceramic, and also independent of the absolute value of the dielectric permittivity.</description>

      <title>Wave-propagation Based Analysis of the Magnetostatic Waves in Ferrite Films Excited by Metallic Transducers</title>

Abstract: It is conventional wisdom that the spectra of the impedances of magnetostatic waves (MSWs) determine the transmissions of MSW devices. In this work, we show that the characteristics of propagating MSWs have critical impacts on the characteristics of transmissions. A wave-propagation based analysis considering the inhomogeneous distributions of magnetic fields is presented for investigating the propagations of MSWs. Based on the analysis, it is demonstrated that the metallic nature of transducers causes the high insertion losses in high-frequency bands, while the dips and severe in-band ripples in low-frequency bands are resulted from the complicated interference between the multiple width modes. Simulations in HFSS verify the analysis with good agreements. Our work advances the understanding of MSWs propagating in ferrite films with metallic structures and paves the way to designing MSW devices aimed at implantation in microwave systems.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</description>

Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted of the profiles of the planar (-110) crystallographic direction in the diamond layer doped with boron atoms. The planar profiles for periodic doping following several ideal dependencies of the boron concentration on the distance in the crystalline medium. Numerical simulations of the channeling and photon emission processes have been carried out for 855 MeV electron and 530 MeV positron beams incident on boron-doped diamond with a four-period bending profile in the samples grown at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The simulations were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. It is shown that the channeling efficiency and the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation strongly depend on the orientation of the incident beam relative to the bent channel profile at the entrance to the boron-doped layer. For the same conditions at the crystal entrance, the intensity of radiation emitted by positrons is significantly higher than that for electrons.</description>

      <title>Giant electro-optic coefficient in single crystal barium titanate on oxide insulator based Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>

Abstract: Electro-optic modulators are indispensable components of modern day photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Recently lithium niobate has emerged as a key material to realize large-bandwidth high-speed modulation, but next-generation modulators require high-density integration, low cost, low power and high performance simultaneously, which are difficult to achieve with established integrated lithium niobate photonics platforms due to its limited electro-optic coefficient. Leveraging its exceptional Pockels coefficient, barium titanate (BTO) in the thin film form has emerged as a promising alternative but the electro-optic coefficients reported in thin-film BTO often fall short of bulk values due to challenges in film growth and waveguide fabrication. Here, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the largest Pockels coefficient (r42) of 1268 pm/V in thin film BTO platform, which is very close to the bulk value. We measure it by using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, fabricated by an optimized wet-etching method for realising single-mode waveguides in single-crystal barium titanate-on-insulator grown by pulsed laser deposition. This giant r42 is extracted from a device in which the optical mode is fully confined within a single-crystal BTO waveguide. This approach contrasts with previous designs where the core material - typically silicon or silicon nitride - supports only partial confinement, resulting in an evanescent overlap with a multi-crystalline BTO layer. This highly confined BTO on insulator electro-optic modulation technology may significantly advance the field of ultra-low-power integrated photonic devices and allows for the realization of next-generation efficient and compact photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Electric Field and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</description>

Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with a slowly-varying envelope (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Quantum Sensing with Rydberg Atomic Receiver: Principles, Experiments and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing using Rydberg atoms offers unprecedented opportunities for next-generation radar systems, transcending classical limitations in miniaturization and spectral agility. Implementing this paradigm for radar sensing, this work proposes a quantum-enhanced radar reception architecture enabled by the emerging Rydberg atomic receiver, replacing conventional antenna-to-mixer chains with a centimeter-scale vapor cell. The proposed approach is based on electromagnetically induced transparency with the Autler-Townes splitting enabling direct RF-to-optical downconversion within the atomic medium via an external co-frequency reference. To circumvent the intrinsic bottleneck on instantaneous bandwidth of atomic receiver, we invoke a non-uniform stepped-frequency synthesis strategy combining coarse laser frequency tuning with fine AC-Stark shift compensation. Additionally, we establish a nonlinear response model of the Rydberg atomic homodyne receiver and propose a customized nonlinear compensation method that extends the linear dynamic range by over 7 dB. We develop a compressive sensing algorithm (CS-Rydberg) to suppress noise and mitigate the undersampling problem. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact prototype achieving centimeter-level ranging precision (RMSE = 1.06 cm) within 1.6-1.9 m. By synthesizing GHz-bandwidth (2.6-3.6 GHz), resolvable target separations down to 15 cm are observed under controlled sparse scenarios. These results not only validate the feasibility of quantum sensing based on Rydberg atomic receivers but also underscore the architecture's inherent scalability: by harnessing the atoms' ultra-broad spectral response, the synthesized bandwidth can be extended well beyond the current range, enabling sub-centimeter resolution in future radar systems while preserving quantum-traceable calibration and a highly simplified front end.</description>
