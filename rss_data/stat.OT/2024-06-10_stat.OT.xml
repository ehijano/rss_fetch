Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to analyze gene expression at the resolution of individual cells, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and complex biological systems. This paper reviews various advanced computational and machine learning techniques tailored for the analysis of scRNA-seq data, emphasizing their roles in different stages of the data processing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Near-peer mentoring in data science: Two experiences at Stanford University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universities have been expanding the data science programs for undergraduate students, with the simultaneous goal of reaching and retaining students from underrepresented groups in the data science workforce. The set of new programs also offer opportunities to involve graduate students, fostering their growth as future leaders in data science education. We describe two programs that use the near peer mentoring structure to provide pathways for graduate students to develop teaching and mentoring skills, while providing research and learning opportunities for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. In the Data Science for Social Good Summer program, graduate students mentor a group of undergraduate fellows as they tackle a data science project with positive social impact. In the Inclusive Mentoring in Data Science course, graduate students participate in workshops on effective and inclusive mentorship strategies. In an experiential learning framework, they are paired with undergraduate students from non-R1 schools, who they mentor through weekly one-on-one on-line meetings. These initiatives offer a prototype of future programs that serve the dual goal of providing both hands-on mentoring experience for graduate students and research opportunities for undergraduate students, in a high-touch inclusive and encouraging environment.</description>
