      <title>On Solving Structured SAT on Ising Machines: A Semiprime Factorization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines are emerging as a new technology for solving various classes of computationally hard problems of practical importance, yet their limits on structured SAT workloads, representative of numerous real-world applications, remain unexplored. We present the first systematic study of such problems, using semiprime factorization as a representative case. Our results show that highly restrictive, 'tight' constraints, when mapped into optimization form, fundamentally distort Ising dynamics, and that these distortions are amplified when problems are decomposed to fit within limited hardware. We propose a hybrid approach that offloads constraint-heavy components to classical preprocessing while reserving the computationally challenging part for the Ising machine. Structured SAT represents a crucial step toward real-world applications, which remain out of reach today due to Ising machine limitations. Our findings reveal that constraint handling is a central obstacle and highlight hybrid hardware-software approaches as the path forward to unlocking the long-term potential of Ising machines. We conduct our evaluation on the manufactured Ising chips and demonstrate that our flow more than doubles the solvable problem size on a 45-spin all-to-all Ising chip, from 8-bit (94 variables) to 11-bit (190 variables), without hardware changes.</description>

      <title>Defect-Aware Physics-Based Compact Model for Ferroelectric nvCap: From TCAD Calibration to Circuit Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric non-volatile capacitance-based memories enable non-destructive readout and low-power in-memory computing with 3D stacking potential. However, their limited memory window (1-10 fF/{\mu}m) requires material-device-circuit co-optimization. Existing compact models fail to capture the physics of small-signal capacitance, device variability, and cycling degradation, which are critical parameters for circuit design. In non-volatile capacitance devices, the small-signal capacitance difference of the polarization states is the key metric. The majority of the reported compact models do not incorporate any physical model of the capacitance as a function of voltage and polarization. We present a physics-based compact model that captures small-signal capacitance, interface and bulk defect contributions, and device variations through multi-scale modeling combining experimental data, TCAD simulations, and circuit validation. Based on this methodology, we show optimized memory read-out with +/- 5 mV sense margin and impact of device endurance at the circuit level. This work presents a comprehensive compact model which enables the design of selector-less arrays and 3D-stacked memories for compute-in-memory and storage memory.</description>

      <title>Lattice Menu: A Low-Error Gaze-Based Marking Menu Utilizing Target-Assisted Gaze Gestures on a Lattice of Visual Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Lattice Menu, a gaze-based marking menu utilizing a lattice of visual anchors that helps perform accurate gaze pointing for menu item selection. Users who know the location of the desired item can leverage target-assisted gaze gestures for multilevel item selection by looking at visual anchors over the gaze trajectories. Our evaluation showed that Lattice Menu exhibits a considerably low error rate (~1%) and a quick menu selection time (1.3-1.6 s) for expert usage across various menu structures (4 x 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 x 6) and sizes (8, 10 and 12{\deg}). In comparison with a traditional gaze-based marking menu that does not utilize visual targets, Lattice Menu showed remarkably (~5 times) fewer menu selection errors for expert usage. In a post-interview, all 12 subjects preferred Lattice Menu, and most subjects (8 out of 12) commented that the provisioning of visual targets facilitated more stable menu selections with reduced eye fatigue.</description>

      <title>Spike Encoding for Environmental Sound: A Comparative Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficient processing suitable for edge applications, but conventional sensor data must first be converted into spike trains for neuromorphic processing. Environmental sound, including urban soundscapes, poses challenges due to variable frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events, while most spike based audio encoding research has focused on speech. This paper analyzes three spike encoding methods, Threshold Adaptive Encoding (TAE), Step Forward (SF), and Moving Window (MW) across three datasets: ESC10, UrbanSound8K, and TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes. Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets. Moreover, TAE yields the lowest spike firing rates, indicating superior energy efficiency. For downstream environmental sound classification with a standard SNN, TAE also achieves the best performance among the compared encoders. Overall, this work provides foundational insights and a comparative benchmark to guide the selection of spike encoders for neuromorphic environmental sound processing.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic yet practical optimization of quantum circuits implementing GF($2^m$) multiplication and division operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optimized quantum circuits for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division operations, which are essential computing primitives in various quantum algorithms. Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\lceil{m/2}\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the CNOT gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \log \log(m)/\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$, including reductions in both CNOT and Toffoli gate counts. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.</description>
