      <title>The dynamics of leadership and success in software development teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From science to industry, teamwork plays a crucial role in knowledge production and innovation. Most studies consider teams as static groups of individuals, thereby failing to capture how the micro-dynamics of collaborative processes and organizational changes determine team success. Here, we leverage fine-grained temporal data on software development teams to gain insights into the dynamics of online collaborative projects. Our analysis reveals an uneven workload distribution in teams, with stronger heterogeneity correlated with higher success, and the early emergence of a lead developer carrying out the majority of work. Moreover, we find that a sizeable fraction of projects experience a change of lead developer, with such a transition being more likely in projects led by inexperienced users. Finally, we show that leadership change is associated with faster success growth, in particular for the least successful projects. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the link between team evolution and success in collaborative processes.</description>

      <title>Flock2: A model for orientation-based social flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aerial flocking of birds, or murmurations, have fascinated observers while presenting many challenges to behavioral study and simulation. We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds' on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SatHub is one of the four hubs of the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS). It focuses on observations, data analysis, software, and training materials to improve our understanding of the impact of satellite constellations on astronomy and observers worldwide. As a preface to more in-depth IAUS385 sessions, we gave a summary of some recent work by SatHub members and the current status of satellite constellations, including optical and radio observations. We shared how the audience can join or get more involved, e.g., via the CPS Slack for asynchronous collaboration. We also touched on what a future with hundreds of thousands of constellation satellites might look like.</description>

      <title>Through the eyes of a reader and science communicator: science in the mainstream and in the genre literature of yesterday and today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most writers the science is either an exotic setting or a source of thrilling conflict that would drive the story forward. For a communicator it is the other way around - the science is neatly wrapped in a package of literary tools that make it "invisible" while it remains tangible and most importantly - it can be conveyed to the reader in understandable terms. There are many examples showing how these seemingly contradicting goals can complement each other successfully. I will review how the science was communicated by mainstream and genre writers of yesterday and today, and in different (not necessarily anglophone) cultures. I will bring forward the best and the worst examples that illuminate various astronomical concepts. Finally, I will discuss how we can use them both in outreach and education. Contrary to many similar summaries I will concentrate on some often overlooked mainstream literary examples, including the plays The Physicists by Friedrich D\"urrenmatt and Copenhagen by Michael Frayn, the novel White Garments by Vl. Dudintsev and even an episode of the Inspector Morse TV show, featuring scientists. I will also mention in passing a few less well known genre books.</description>

      <title>Social Echo Chambers in Quantum Field Theory: Exploring Faddeev-Popov Ghosts Phenomena, Loop Diagrams, and Cut-off Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the emergence and impact of filter bubbles in social phenomena, especially in both digital and offline environments, by applying the concepts of quantum field theory. Filter bubbles tend to occur in digital and offline environments, targeting digital natives with extremely low media literacy and information immunity. In addition, in the aftermath of stealth marketing, fake news, "inspirational marketing," and other forms of stealth marketing that never exist are rampant and can lead to major social disruption and exploitation. These are the causes of various social risks, including declining information literacy and knowledge levels and academic achievement. By exploring quantum mechanical principles such as remote interaction, proximity interaction, Feynman diagrams, and loop diagrams, we aim to gain a better understanding of information dissemination and opinion formation in social contexts. Our model incorporates key parameters such as agents' opinions, interaction probabilities, and flexibility in changing opinions, facilitating the observation of opinion distributions, cluster formation, and polarization under a variety of conditions. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically model the filter bubble phenomenon using the concepts of quantum field theory and to analyze its social consequences. This is a discussion paper and the proposed approach offers an innovative perspective for understanding social phenomena, but its interpretation and application require careful consideration. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modeling of Filter Bubbles Based on Kubo-Matsubara Form Green's Functions Considering Remote and Proximity Interactions:Ultraviolet Divergence to Indefinite Ghosting, Consideration of Cut Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research aims to model tracks the evolution of opinions among agents and their collective dynamics, and mathematically represents the resonance of opinions and echo chamber effects within the filter bubble by including non-physical factors such as misinformation and confirmation bias, known as FP ghosting phenomena.The indeterminate ghost phenomenon, a social science concept similar to the uncertainty principle, depicts the variability of social opinion by incorporating information uncertainty and nonlinearities in opinion formation into the model. Furthermore, by introducing the Kubo formula and the Matsubara form of the Green's function, we mathematically express temporal effects and model how past, present, and future opinions interact to reveal the mechanisms of opinion divergence and aggregation. Our model uses multiple parameters, including population density and extremes of opinion generated on a random number basis, to simulate the formation and growth of filter bubbles and their progression to ultraviolet divergence phenomena. In this process, we observe how resonance or disconnection of opinions within a society occurs via a disconnection function (type la, lb, ll, lll). However, the interpretation of the results requires careful consideration, and empirical verification is a future challenge.Finally, we will share our hypotheses and considerations for the model case of this paper, which is a close examination of regional differences in media coverage and its effectiveness and considerations unique to Japan, a disaster-prone country.</description>

      <title>Note: Evolutionary Game Theory Focus Informational Health: The Cocktail Party Effect Through Werewolfgame under Incomplete Information and ESS Search Method Using Expected Gains of Repeated Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the state of information disruption caused by the cocktail party effect within the framework of non-perfect information games and evolutive games with multiple werewolves. In particular, we mathematically model and analyze the effects on the gain of each strategy choice and the formation process of evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) under the assumption that the pollution risk of fake news is randomly assigned in the context of repeated dilemmas. We will develop the computational process in detail, starting with the construction of the gain matrix, modeling the evolutionary dynamics using the replicator equation, and identifying the ESS. In addition, numerical simulations will be performed to observe system behavior under different initial conditions and parameter settings to better understand the impact of the spread of fake news on strategy evolution. This research will provide theoretical insights into the complex issues of contemporary society regarding the authenticity of information and expand the range of applications of evolutionary game theory.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Entanglement: Balancing Punishment and Compensation, Repeated Dilemma Game-Theoretic Analysis of Maximum Compensation Problem for Bypass and Least Cost Paths in Fact-Checking, Case of Fake News with Weak Wallace's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research note is organized with respect to a novel approach to solving problems related to the spread of fake news and effective fact-checking. Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent.

      <title>Discussion of Loop Expansion and Introduction of Series Cutting Functions to Local Potential Approximation: Complexity Analysis Using Green's Functions, Cutting Of Nth-Order Social Interactions For Progressive Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the aforementioned paper, "Examination Kubo-Matsubara Green's Function Of The Edwards-Anderson Model: Extreme Value Information Flow Of Nth-Order Interpolated Extrapolation Of Zero Phenomena Using The Replica Method (2024)". This paper also applies theoretical physics methods to better understand the filter bubble phenomenon, focusing in particular on loop expansions and truncation functions. Using the loop expansion method, the complexity of social interactions during the occurrence of filter bubbles will be discussed in order to introduce series, express mathematically, and evaluate the impact of these interactions. We analyze the interactions between agents and their time evolution using a variety of Green's functions, including delayed Green's functions, advanced Green's functions, and causal Green's functions, to capture the dynamic response of the system through local potential approximations. In addition, we apply truncation functions and truncation techniques to ensure incremental safety and evaluate the long-term stability of the system. This approach will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of filter bubble generation and dissolution, and discuss insights into their prevention and management. This research explores the possibilities of applying theoretical physics frameworks to social science problems and examines methods for analyzing the complex dynamics of information flow and opinion formation in digital society.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent.

      <title>Lane formation in an active particle model with chirality for pedestrian traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05454v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pattern formation in systems of active particles with chiral forces in the context of pedestrian dynamics. To describe the interparticle interactions, we use the standard social force model and supplement it with a new type of force that reflects chirality. We perform numerical simulations of two pedestrian flows moving in opposite directions along a corridor. We observe two dynamic phase transitions that occur for varying number densities of particles and strengths of the chirality force: one from disordered motion to multi-lane motion and another from multi-lane to two-lane motion. We develop a qualitative theory that describes the demarcation lines for these phase transitions in the phase diagram chirality-density. The results of our analysis agree fairly well with the simulation data. A comparison with previously reported experimental data has been provided. Our findings may find applications in urban and transportation-planning problems.</description>

      <title>A switching state-space transmission model for tracking epidemics and assessing interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective control of infectious diseases relies on accurate assessment of the impact of interventions, which is often hindered by the complex dynamics of the spread of disease. A Beta-Dirichlet switching state-space transmission model is proposed to track underlying dynamics of disease and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions simultaneously. As time evolves, the switching mechanism introduced in the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model is able to capture the timing and magnitude of changes in the transmission rate due to the effectiveness of control measures. The implementation of this model is based on a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which can estimate the time evolution of SEIR states, switching states, and high-dimensional parameters efficiently. The efficacy of the proposed model and estimation procedure are demonstrated through simulation studies. With a real-world application to British Columbia's COVID-19 outbreak, the proposed switching state-space transmission model quantifies the reduction of transmission rate following interventions. The proposed model provides a promising tool to inform public health policies aimed at studying the underlying dynamics and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions during the spread of the disease.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Swap distance minimization beyond entropy minimization in word order variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we consider the problem of all the possible orders of a linguistic structure formed by $n$ elements, for instance, subject, direct object and verb ($n=3$) or subject, direct object, indirect object and verb ($n=4$). We investigate if the frequency of the $n!$ possible orders is constrained by two principles. First, entropy minimization, a principle that has been suggested to shape natural communication systems at distinct levels of organization. Second, swap distance minimization, namely a preference for word orders that require fewer swaps of adjacent elements to be produced from a source order. Here we present average swap distance, a novel score for research on swap distance minimization, and investigate the theoretical distribution of that score for any $n$: its minimum and maximum values and its expected value in die rolling experiments or when the word order frequencies are shuffled. We investigate whether entropy and average swap distance are significantly small in distinct linguistic structures with $n=3$ or $n=4$ in agreement with the corresponding minimization principles. We find strong evidence of entropy minimization and swap distance minimization with respect to a die rolling experiment. The evidence of these two forces with respect to a Polya urn process is strong for $n=4$ but weaker for $n=3$. We still find evidence of swap distance minimization when word order frequencies are shuffled, indicating that swap distance minimization effects are beyond pressure to minimize word order entropy.</description>
