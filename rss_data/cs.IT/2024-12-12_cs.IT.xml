      <title>Turbo Receiver Design with Joint Detection and Demapping for Coded Differential BPSK in Bursty Impulsive Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recognized that the impulsive noise (IN) generated by power devices poses significant challenges to wireless receivers in practice. In this paper, we assess the achievable information rate (AIR) and the performance of practical turbo receiver designs for a well-established Markov-Middleton IN model. We utilize a commonly used commercial transmission setup consisting of a convolutional encoder, bit-level interleaver, and a differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) symbol mapper. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the AIRs of the underlying channel model using DBPSK transmitted symbols across various channel conditions. Additionally, we introduce two robust turbo-like receiver designs. The first design features a separate IN detector and a turbo-demapper-decoder. The second design employs a joint approach, where the extrinsic information of both the detector and demapper is simultaneously updated, forming a turbo-detector-demapper-decoder structure. We show that the joint design consistently outperforms the separate design across all channel conditions, particularly in low AIR situations. However, the maximum performance gain for the channel conditions considered in this paper is merely 0.2 dB, and the joint system incurs significantly greater computational complexity, especially for a high number of turbo iterations. The performance of the two proposed turbo receiver designs is demonstrated to be close to the estimated AIR, with a performance gap dependent on the channel parameters.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Error Probability of RPA Decoding of Reed-Muller Codes Over the BSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Recursive Projection-Aggregation (RPA) decoder, of Ye and Abbe (2020), for Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Our main contribution is an explicit upper bound on the probability of incorrect decoding, using the RPA decoder, over a binary symmetric channel (BSC). Importantly, we focus on the events where a single iteration of the RPA decoder, in each recursive call, is sufficient for convergence. Key components of our analysis are explicit estimates of the probability of incorrect decoding of first-order RM codes using a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, and estimates of the error probabilities during the aggregation phase of the RPA decoder. Our results allow us to show that for RM codes with blocklength $N = 2^m$, the RPA decoder can achieve vanishing error probabilities, in the large blocklength limit, for RM orders that grow roughly logarithmically in $m$.</description>

      <title>Structured IB: Improving Information Bottleneck with Structured Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the generalization, robustness, and interpretability of deep neural networks, demonstrating efficacy across image segmentation, document clustering, and semantic communication. Among IB implementations, the IB Lagrangian method, employing Lagrangian multipliers, is widely adopted. While numerous methods for the optimizations of IB Lagrangian based on variational bounds and neural estimators are feasible, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of their design, which is inherently prone to errors. To address this limitation, we introduce Structured IB, a framework for investigating potential structured features. By incorporating auxiliary encoders to extract missing informative features, we generate more informative representations. Our experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy and task-relevant information preservation compared to the original IB Lagrangian method, even with reduced network size.</description>

      <title>Fast Beam Placement for Ultra-Dense LEO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has brought about significant improvements in wireless communications, characterized by low latency and reduced transmission loss compared to geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites. Ultra-dense LEO satellites can serve many users by generating active beams effective to their locations. The beam placement problem is challenging but important for efficiently allocating resources with a large number of users. This paper formulates and solves a fast beam placement optimization problem for ultra-dense satellite systems to enhance the link budget with a minimum number of active beams (NABs). To achieve this goal and balance load among beams within polynomial time, we propose two algorithms for large user groups exploiting the modified K-means clustering and the graph theory. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposals in terms of the statistical channel gain-to-noise ratio and computation time over state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Age of Information for A Discrete-Time hybrid Dual-Queue System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using multiple sensors to update the status process of interest is promising in improving the information freshness. The unordered arrival of status updates at the monitor end poses a significant challenge in analyzing the timeliness performance of parallel updating systems. This work investigates the age of information (AoI) of a discrete-time dual-sensor status updating system. Specifically, the status update is generated following the zero-waiting policy. The two sensors are modeled as a geometrically distributed service time queue and a deterministic service time queue in parallel. We derive the analytical expressions for the average AoI and peak AoI using the graphical analysis method. Moreover, the connection of average AoI between discrete-time and continuous-time systems is also explored. It is shown that the AoI result of the continuous-time system is a limit case of that of the corresponding discrete-time system. Hence, the AoI result of the discrete-time system is more general than the continuous one. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our analysis and further show that randomness of service time contributes more AoI reduction than determinacy of service time in dual-queue systems in most cases, which is different from what is known about the single-queue system.</description>

      <title>Constructions of non-Generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Reed-Solomon codes form the most prominent class of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes that are optimal in the sense that their minimum distance cannot be improved for a given length and code size. The study of codes that are MDS yet not generalized Reed-Solomon codes, called non-generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes, started with the work by Roth and Lemple (1989), where the first examples where exhibited. It then gained traction thanks to the work by Beelen (2017), who introduced twisted Reed-Solomon codes, and showed that families of such codes are non-generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes. Finding non-generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes is naturally motivated by the classification of MDS codes.
  In this paper, we provide a generic construction of MDS codes, yielding infinitely many examples. We then explicit families of non-generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes. Finally we position some of the proposed codes with respect to generalized twisted Reed-Solomon codes, and provide new view points on this family of codes.</description>

      <title>Galois hulls of constacyclic codes over affine algebra rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ the affine algebra given by the ring $\mathbb{F}_q[X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_\ell]/ I$, where $I$ is the ideal $\langle t_1(X_1), t_2(X_2), \ldots, t_\ell(X_\ell) \rangle$ with each $t_i(X_i)$, $1\leq i\leq \ell$, being a square-free polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This paper studies the $k$-Galois hulls of $\lambda$-constacyclic codes over $\mathcal A$ regarding their idempotent generators. For this, first, we define the $k$-Galois inner product over $\mathcal A$ and find the form of the generators of the $k$-Galois dual and the $k$-Galois hull of a $\lambda$-constacyclic code over $\mathcal A$. Then, we derive a formula for the $k$-Galois hull dimension of a $\lambda$-constacyclic code. Further, we provide a condition for a $\lambda$-constacyclic code to be $k$-Galois LCD. Finally, we give some examples of the use of these codes in constructing entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication: Architectures, Technologies, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in semantic communication (SemCom) and presents a thorough study. Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Modified Baum-Welch Algorithm for Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Turbo Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind estimation of intersymbol interference channels based on the Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm, a specific implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for training hidden Markov models, is robust and does not require labeled data. However, it is known for its extensive computation cost, slow convergence, and frequently converges to a local maximum. In this paper, we modified the trellis structure of the BW algorithm by associating the channel parameters with two consecutive states. This modification enables us to reduce the number of required states by half while maintaining the same performance. Moreover, to improve the convergence rate and the estimation performance, we construct a joint turbo-BW-equalization system by exploiting the extrinsic information produced by the turbo decoder to refine the BW-based estimator at each EM iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that the joint system achieves convergence in just 4 EM iterations, which is 8 iterations less than a separate system design for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6 dB. Additionally, the joint system provides improved estimation accuracy with a mean square error (MSE) of $10^{-4}$. We also identify scenarios where a joint design is not preferable, especially when the channel is noisy (e.g., SNR=2 dB) and the turbo decoder is unable to provide reliable extrinsic information for a BW-based estimator.</description>

      <title>Generalized free energy and excess entropy production for active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized free energy potential for active systems, including both stochastic master equations and deterministic nonlinear chemical reaction networks. Our generalized free energy is defined variationally as the "most irreversible" state observable. This variational principle is motivated from several perspectives, including large deviations theory, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, Onsager theory, and information-theoretic optimal transport. In passive systems, the most irreversible observable is the usual free energy potential and its irreversibility is the entropy production rate (EPR). In active systems, the most irreversible observable is the generalized free energy and its irreversibility gives the excess EPR, the nonstationary contribution to dissipation. The remaining "housekeeping" EPR is a genuine nonequilibrium contribution that quantifies the nonconservative nature of the forces. We derive far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic speed limits for excess EPR, applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems. Our approach overcomes several limitations of the steady-state potential and the Hatano-Sasa (adiabatic/nonadiabatic) decomposition, as we demonstrate in several examples.</description>

Abstract: We give a new construction of binary quantum codes that enables the generation of a CSS-T code from any given CSS code. Using this construction, we prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same result holds for binary quantum low-density parity check CSS-T codes, and establish the existence of asymptotically good CSS codes that support any given $Z$ rotation transversally. Finally, we analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from our construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced belief propagation for LDPC decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding low-density parity-check codes is critical in many current technologies, such as fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and satellite communications. The belief propagation algorithm allows for fast decoding due to the low density of these codes. However, there is scope for improvement to this algorithm both in terms of its computational cost when decoding large codes and its error-correcting abilities. Here, we introduce the quantum-enhanced belief propagation (QEBP) algorithm, in which the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) acts as a pre-processing step to belief propagation. We perform exact simulations of syndrome decoding with QAOA, whose result guides the belief propagation algorithm, leading to faster convergence and a lower block error rate (BLER). In addition, through the repetition code, we study the possibility of having shared variational parameters between syndromes and, in this case, code lengths. We obtain a unique pair of variational parameters for level-1 QAOA by optimizing the probability of successful decoding through a transfer matrix method. Then, using these parameters, we compare the scaling of different QAOA post-processing techniques with code length.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sum-Rate Maximization Algorithm for Fluid Antenna-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, with joint antenna position optimization and waveform design. We consider enhancing the sum-rate maximization (SRM) and sensing performance with the aid of FAs. Although the introduction of FAs brings more degrees of freedom for performance optimization, its position optimization poses a non-convex programming problem and brings great computational challenges. This letter contributes to building an efficient design algorithm by the block successive upper bound minimization and majorization-minimization principles, with each step admitting closed-form update for the ISAC waveform design. In addition, the extrapolation technique is exploited further to speed up the empirical convergence of FA position design. Simulation results show that the proposed design can achieve state-of-the-art sum-rate performance with at least 60% computation cutoff compared to existing works with successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We formalize the problem of prompt compression for large language models (LLMs) and present a framework to unify token-level prompt compression methods which create hard prompts for black-box models. We derive the distortion-rate function for this setup as a linear program, and provide an efficient algorithm to compute this fundamental limit via the dual of the linear program. Using the distortion-rate function as the baseline, we study the performance of existing compression schemes on a synthetic dataset consisting of prompts generated from a Markov chain, natural language queries, and their respective answers. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the criticality of query-aware prompt compression, where the compressor has knowledge of the downstream task/query for the black-box LLM. We show that there is a large gap between the performance of current prompt compression methods and the optimal strategy, and propose Adaptive QuerySelect, a query-aware, variable-rate adaptation of a prior work to close the gap. We extend our experiments to a small natural language dataset to further confirm our findings on our synthetic dataset.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning for IRS-Assisted MEC Systems with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems have shown notable improvements in efficiency, such as reduced latency, higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, the resource competition among users will lead to uneven allocation, increased latency, and lower throughput. Fortunately, the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique has emerged as a promising solution for managing interference and optimizing resource allocation in MEC systems. This paper studies an IRS-assisted MEC system with RSMA, aiming to jointly optimize the passive beamforming of the IRS, the active beamforming of the base station, the task offloading allocation, the transmit power of users, the ratios of public and private information allocation, and the decoding order of the RSMA to minimize the average delay from a novel uplink transmission perspective. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize both continuous and discrete variables of the problem. Additionally, to better extract channel features, we design a novel network architecture within the policy and evaluation networks of the proposed algorithm, combining convolutional neural networks and densely connected convolutional network for feature extraction. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits excellent convergence performance but also outperforms various benchmarks.</description>
