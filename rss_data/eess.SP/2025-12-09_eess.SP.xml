      <title>Why Nonlinear Models Matter: Unified Analysis of Cognitive Load, Stress, and Exercise Using Wearable Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable physiological signals exhibit strong nonlinear and subject-dependent behavior, challenging traditional linear models. This study provides a unified evaluation of cognitive load, stress, and physical exercise recognition using three public Empatica~E4 datasets. Across all conditions, nonlinear machine learning models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving 0.89--0.98 accuracy and 0.96--0.99 ROC--AUC, while linear models remained below 0.70--0.73 AUC. Although Leave-One-Subject-Out validation revealed substantial inter-individual variability, nonlinear models maintained moderate cross-person generalization. Ablation and statistical analyses confirmed the necessity of multimodal fusion, particularly EDA, temperature, and ACC, while SHAP interpretability validated these findings by uncovering physiologically meaningful feature contributions across tasks. Overall, the results demonstrate that physiological state recognition is fundamentally nonlinear and establish a unified benchmark to guide the development of more robust wearable health-monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Beamspace Dimensionality Reduction for Massive MU-MIMO: Geometric Insights and Information-Theoretic Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamspace dimensionality reduction, a classical tool in array processing, has been shown in recent work to significantly reduce computational complexity and training overhead for adaptive reception in massive multiuser (MU) MIMO. For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting.</description>

      <title>Non-Equiprobable Signaling for Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of OFDM systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM.</description>

      <title>Scaling Wideband Hybrid Beamforming for sub-THz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity attainable for a multiuser MIMO uplink as we scale both array size and bandwidth for regimes in which all-digital arrays incur excessive hardware complexity and power consumption. We consider a tiled hybrid beamforming architecture in which each tile, or subarray, is a phased array performing analog (or RF) beamforming, followed by DSP on the tile outputs. For parameters compatible with sub-THz fixed access links, we discuss hardware and power consumption considerations for choosing tile size and the number of tiles. Noting that the problem of optimal multiuser MIMO in our wideband regime is open even for the simplest possible channel models, we compare the spectral efficiencies attainable by a number of reasonable strategies for tile-level RF beamforming, assuming flexibility in the digital signal processing (DSP) of the tile outputs. We consider a number of beam broadening approaches for addressing the ``beam squint'' incurred by RF beamforming in our wideband regime, along with strategies for sharing tiles among users. Information-theoretic benchmarks are computed for an idealized MIMO-OFDM system, with linear per-subcarrier multiuser detection compared against an unconstrained complexity receiver.</description>

      <title>Scaling Wideband Massive MIMO Radar via Tiled Beamspace Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coordinated tiled architecture for scalable wideband digital beamforming in massive MIMO radar systems. As aperture size increases, conventional full-array MVDR processing becomes prohibitive due to the cubic complexity of covariance estimation and inversion. Building on the principle of energy concentration in beamspace, we introduce a tiled windowed-beamspace MVDR framework that distributes spatial FFT processing across subarrays while performing joint beamforming in a compact global beamspace domain. Each tile applies a 2D spatial DFT followed by an angle-of-arrival dependent beamspace window, producing a reduced-dimensional representation that preserves the dominant spatial structure of the received signal. The windowed outputs from the tiles are concatenated and processed by a centralized MVDR beamformer, enabling coherent full-aperture processing with drastically reduced dimensionality. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves detection and interference suppression performance comparable to full-dimensional processing, while substantially lowering computational cost, memory usage, and training requirements. The framework also reveals tradeoffs among tile size, window size, and beamspace resolution that govern overall system scalability.</description>

      <title>Teaching large language models to see in radar: aspect-distributed prototypes for few-shot HRRP ATR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) play a critical role in automatic target recognition (ATR) due to their richinformationregarding target scattering centers (SCs), which encapsulate the geometric and electromagnetic characteristics of thetarget.Under few-shot circumstances, traditional learning-based methods often suffer from overfitting and struggle togeneralizeeffectively. The recently proposed HRRPLLM, which leverages the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) for one-shot HRRP ATR, is limited in few-shot scenarios. This limitation arises because it primarilyutilizesthe distribution of SCs for recognition while neglecting the variance of the samples caused by aspect sensitivity. Thispaperproposes a straightforward yet effective Aspect-Distributed Prototype (ADP) strategy for LLM-based ATRunder few-shotconditions to enhance aspect robustness. Experiments conducted on both simulated and measured aircraft electromagneticdatasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Programmable Metasurfaces for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation and beyond (B6G) networks are envisioned to support advanced applications that demand high-speed communication, high-precision sensing, and high-performance computing. To underpin this multi-functional evolution, energy- and cost-efficient programmable metasurfaces (PMs) have emerged as a promising technology for dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of representative multi-functional PM paradigms, with a specific focus on achieving \emph{full-space communication coverage}, \emph{ubiquitous sensing}, as well as \emph{intelligent signal processing and computing}. i) For simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (STARS)-enabled full-space communications, we elaborate on their operational protocols and pivotal applications in supporting efficient communications, physical layer security, unmanned aerial vehicle networks, and wireless power transfer. ii) For PM-underpinned ubiquitous sensing, we formulate the signal models for the PM-assisted architecture and systematically characterize its advantages in near-field and cooperative sensing, while transitioning to the PM-enabled transceiver architecture and demonstrating its superior performance in multi-band operations. iii) For advanced signal processing and computing, we explore the novel paradigm of stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), investigating their implementation in wave-domain analog processing and over-the-air mathematical computing. Finally, we identify key research challenges and envision future directions for multi-functional PMs towards B6G.</description>

      <title>Message Passing Based Demodulation of the Time-Encoded Digital Modulation Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a Message Passing (MP) based algorithm for demodulating the time-encoded digital modulation signal. The proposed algorithm processes the spikes generated by the Time-Encoding Machine (TEM) directly on a per-spike basis, which enables "on-the-fly" demodulatio with low latency. The computational complexity of our proposed method scales linearly with the number of demodulated symbols, while the computational complexity of the pseudo-inverse-based method scales cubically with the same number of demodulated symbols.</description>

      <title>Effective Electromagnetic Degrees of Freedom in Backscatter MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the definition of the effective electromagnetic degrees of freedom (EEMDOFs) of a static linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is well established, the counterpart for a backscatter MIMO (BS-MIMO) system is so far missing. A BS-MIMO system encodes the input information into the loads of backscatter elements. Due to mutual coupling, the mapping from load configuration to observed fields is fundamentally non-linear, which complicates the analysis of BS-EEMDOFs. We introduce a definition of BS-EEMDOFs based on the Jacobian of the observed fields with respect to the load configuration. We derive a closed-form expression from multiport network theory which demonstrates that the number of BS-EEMDOFs is fundamentally a distributed variable, whose distribution depends on the mutual coupling between the backscatter elements and the coherent illumination. The modes associated with BS-EEMDOFs lie in the column space of the end-to-end channel matrix from backscatter array ports to receiver ports, but the number of BS-EEMDOFs is generally different from the number of benchmark EEMDOFs associated with the same array being coherently fed rather than tunably terminated. The dependence on the coherent illumination yields optimized coherent illumination as a control knob for the number of BS-EEMDOFs. We present numerical and experimental results for the evaluation and optimization of the number of BS-EEMDOFs in different radio environments with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bruxism Recognition via Wireless Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bruxism is an oromandibular movement disorder involving teeth grinding and clenching, which severely impairs sleep quality and dental health. However, its diagnosis remains challenging, as existing methods often cause discomfort or compromise user privacy. To address these limitations, we establish a contactless bruxism recognition system based on millimeter-wave radar. First, we analyzed the potential impact of the movement patterns of teeth grinding on radar echo signals. Based on this analysis, 11 features were extracted. Subsequently, using these features, we performed classification with a Random Forest model on the dataset constructed via millimeter-wave radar. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 96.1% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score all remaining at a relatively high level. This study validates the effectiveness of millimeter-wave radar for SB recognition, providing a non-invasive and privacy-friendly alternative to existing recognition techniques. Future research will focus on enhancing the robustness of the method across diverse populations and environments, as well as striving to mitigate the interference of other facial micro-movements on teeth grinding recognition.</description>

      <title>Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, Computing, and Control Meets UAV Swarms in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop the low-altitude economy, the establishment of the low-altitude wireless network (LAWN) is the first priority. As the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increases, how to support the reliable flying and effective functioning of UAV swarms is challenging. Recently, the integrated sensing, communication, computing, and control (ISCCC) strategy was designed, which could act as effective physical {\it reflex arc} links in the intelligent LAWN system. Thus, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities when ISCCC meets UAV swarm in LAWN in 6G. First, we propose a three-layer ISCCC structure for the UAV swarm, which is categorized according to the UAV swarm's requirements, i.e., flying, self-organizing, and functioning. Second, for different scenarios, we study the basic problem, promising technologies, and challenges to design ISCCC for UAV swarms. Third, through a case study that minimizes the flying trajectory error of the UAV swarm based on the ISCCC principle, we show that ISCCC is promising to simultaneously improve the reliability and efficiency of LAWN via jointly designing four components. Finally, we discuss the promising directions for the ISCCC-based UAV swarm in LAWN.</description>

      <title>TagLabel: RFID Based Orientation and Material Sensing for Automated Package Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern logistics systems face increasing difficulty in identifying counterfeit products, fraudulent returns, and hazardous items concealed within packages, yet current package screening methods remain too slow, expensive, and impractical for widespread use. This paper presents TagLabel, an RFID based system that determines both the orientation and contents of packages using low cost passive UHF tags. By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations.</description>

      <title>Near Field Electric (NFE): Energy-efficient, High-speed Communication at Decimeter-range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field technologies enable contactless payments, building access, automotive keyless entry, and supply chain tracking. Existing approaches face fundamental trade-offs: magnetic-based methods (NFC/NFMI) achieve low power but are limited to sub-megabit rates, while millimeter-wave techniques provide gigabits/sec connectivity at higher power consumption and only centimeter-scale ranges. We demonstrate that near-field electric (NFE) communication breaks this trade-off via capacitive coupling enabled by confined electric fields. NFE simultaneously achieves ultra-low power ($&lt;$1 mW per transceiver), high-speed data throughput ($&gt;$3 Mbps), and configurable decimeter-range (5-30 cm) capabilities previously considered mutually exclusive. Systematic measurements across multiple orientations and configurations show NFE can support decimeter communication coverage. The power consumption of 0.4 mW at the transmitter (Tx) and 0.6 mW at the receiver (Rx), when combined is up to $\sim$24$\times$ lower than NFC and $\sim$3$\times$ lower than NFMI while achieving significantly higher data rates, and a couple of orders of magnitude lower power than mm-wave based technique. Testing with symmetrical electrodes across eight orientations validated consistent performance and robustness for practical deployments. Extended-range experiments achieved stable 2 Mbps throughput at 3.5 meters using conductive media, demonstrating NFE's unique ability to leverage environmental conductors. Optimized device design can facilitate achieving an extended range for Body-assisted NFE up to 1 m. Results establish NFE as foundational for next-generation wireless applications where security, low power, and throughput converge, enabling dense IoT deployments, secure payment systems, and high-speed device-to-device communication previously limited by the power-performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Non-negative DAG Learning from Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the instantaneous dependencies underlying a multivariate time series. The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Deep Quantitative Group Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network-based framework for solving the quantitative group testing (QGT) problem that achieves both high decoding accuracy and structural verifiability. In QGT, the objective is to identify a small subset of defective items among $N$ candidates using only $M \ll N$ pooled tests, each reporting the number of defectives in the tested subset. We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations. Beyond accuracy, we show that the trained network implicitly learns the underlying pooling structure that links items to tests, allowing this structure to be recovered directly from the network's Jacobian. This indicates that the model does not merely memorize training patterns but internalizes the true combinatorial relationships governing QGT. Our findings reveal that standard feedforward architectures can learn verifiable inverse mappings in structured combinatorial recovery problems.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective XL-MIMO Communication with Cylinder Directly-Connected Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, thanks to its superior spatial resolution and beamforming gains. In order to realize XL-MIMO costeffectively, an innovative ray antenna array (RAA) architecture with directly-connected uniform linear array (ULA) was recently proposed, which achieves flexible beamforming without relying on traditional analog phase shifters or digital beamforming. However, RAA suffers from the signal blockage issue since its ray-configured ULAs are placed in the same plane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel antenna array architecture termed cylinder directly-connected antenna array (DCAA), which is achieved via multiple simple uniform circular array (sUCA) with carefully designed orientations in a layered three-dimensional structure. The so-called sUCA partitions the uniform circular array (UCA) into two sub-arrays where each sub-array has all antenna elements directly connected to achieve a desired beam direction corresponding to the sub-array's physical orientation, thus achieving full spatial coverage. Compared with the conventional ULA architecture with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed cylinder DCAA can achieve uniform spatial resolution, enhanced communication rate and lower hardware costs. Simulation results are provided to validate the promised gains of cylinder DCAA, demonstrating its great potential for high-frequency systems such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) systems.</description>

      <title>An Asynchronous Mixed-Signal Resonate-and-Fire Neuron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog computing at the edge is an emerging strategy to limit data storage and transmission requirements, as well as energy consumption, and its practical implementation is in its initial stages of development. Translating properties of biological neurons into hardware offers a pathway towards low-power, real-time edge processing. Specifically, resonator neurons offer selectivity to specific frequencies as a potential solution for temporal signal processing. Here, we show a fabricated Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) mixed-signal Resonate-and-Fire (R&amp;F) neuron circuit implementation that emulates the behavior of these neural cells responsible for controlling oscillations within the central nervous system. We integrate the design with asynchronous handshake capabilities, perform comprehensive variability analyses, and characterize its frequency detection functionality. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale integration within neuromorphic systems, thereby advancing the exploitation of bio-inspired circuits for efficient edge temporal signal processing.</description>

      <title>Impact of RIS Orientation on Throughput in UAV-Assisted Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) orientation on the throughput performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems. Specifically, we study how physical rotation of the RIS, through controlled azimuth and elevation adjustments, influences the effective channel and data rate. A UAV-mounted RIS enables directional alignment to serve ground users in scenarios where the direct Base Station (BS)-to-user path is blocked. Using the SimRIS channel simulator, we analyze the system under various rotation angles and present performance heatmaps that highlight optimal RIS orientations. The study shows that RIS alignment has a substantial effect on achievable rates, thereby motivating orientation-aware optimization in practical deployments.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-Based Contrastive Learning for GNSS Jamming Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are fundamental in applications across navigation, transportation, and industrial networks. However, their extremely low received power makes them highly vulnerable to radio-frequency interference (RFI) and intentional jamming. Modern data-driven methods offer powerful representational power for such applications, however real-time and reliable jamming detection on resource-limited embedded receivers remains a key challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of the conventional learning paradigm. To address these challenges, this work presents a dictionary-based contrastive learning (DBCL) framework for GNSS jamming detection that integrates transfer learning, contrastive representation learning, and model compression techniques. The framework combines tuned contrastive and dictionary-based loss functions to enhance feature separability under low-data conditions and applies structured pruning and knowledge distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive evaluation across varying data regimes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms modern CNN, MobileViT, and ResNet-18 architectures. The framework achieves a substantial reduction in memory footprint and inference latency, confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power GNSS interference detection on embedded platforms.</description>

      <title>Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems (SWANs) for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN)-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed. Unlike conventional pinching antenna systems (PASS), which use a single long waveguide, SWAN divides the waveguide into multiple short segments, each with a dedicated feed point. Thanks to the segmented structure, SWAN enhances sensing performance by significantly simplifying the reception model and reducing the in-waveguide propagation loss. To balance performance and complexity, three segment controlling protocols are proposed for the transceivers, namely i) \emph{segment selection} to select a single segment for signal transceiving, ii) \emph{segment aggregation} to aggregate signals from all segments using a single RF chain, and iii) \emph{segment multiplexing} to jointly process the signals from all segments using individual RF chains. The theoretical sensing performance limit is first analyzed for different protocols, unveiling how the sensing performance gain of SWAN scales with the number of segments. Based on this performance limit, the Pareto fronts of sensing and communication performance are characterized for the simple one-user one-target case, which is then extended to the general multi-user single-target case based on time-division multiple access (TDMA). Numerical results are presented to verify the correctness of the derivations and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which jointly confirm the advantages of SWAN-assisted ISAC.</description>

      <title>BitStopper: An Efficient Transformer Attention Accelerator via Stage-fusion and Early Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based large language models (LLMs) have transformed modern AI applications, but the quadratic cost of self-attention imposes significant compute and memory overhead. Dynamic sparsity (DS) attention mitigates this, yet its hardware efficiency is limited by the added prediction stage and the heavy memory traffic it entails. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BitStopper, a fine-grained algorithm-architecture co-design that operates without a sparsity predictor. First, a bit-serial enable stage fusion (BESF) mechanism is proposed to reuse and minimize the memory access by progressively terminating trivial tokens and merging the prediction stage into the execution stage. Second, a lightweight and adaptive token selection (LATS) strategy is developed to work in concert with the bit-level sparsity speculation. Third, a bit-level asynchronous processing (BAP) strategy is employed to improve compute utilization during the on-demand bit-grained memory fetching. Finally, an elaborate architecture is designed to translate the theoretical complexity reduction into practical performance improvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer accelerators, BitStopper achieves 2.03x and 1.89x speedups over Sanger and SOFA, respectively, while delivering 2.4x and 2.1x improvements in energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Decoding Motor Behavior Using Deep Learning and Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to EEG decoding for non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMIs), with a focus on motor-behavior classification. While conventional convolutional architectures such as EEGNet and DeepConvNet are effective in capturing local spatial patterns, they are markedly less suited for modeling long-range temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. To address this limitation, we integrate an Echo State Network (ESN), a prominent paradigm in reservoir computing into the decoding pipeline. ESNs construct a high-dimensional, sparsely connected recurrent reservoir that excels at tracking temporal dynamics, thereby complementing the spatial representational power of CNNs. Evaluated on a skateboard-trick EEG dataset preprocessed via the PREP pipeline and implemented in MNE-Python, our ESNNet achieves 83.2% within-subject and 51.3% LOSO accuracies, surpassing widely used CNN-based baselines.

      <title>Learning Conditional Independence Differential Graphs From Time-Dependent Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of differences in conditional independence graphs (CIGs) of two time series Gaussian graphical models (TSGGMs) is investigated where the two TSGGMs are known to have similar structure. The TSGGM structure is encoded in the inverse power spectral density (IPSD) of the time series. In several existing works, one is interested in estimating the difference in two precision matrices to characterize underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of data consisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations. In this paper we consider estimation of the difference in two IPSDs to characterize the underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of time-dependent data. Our approach accounts for data time dependencies unlike past work. We analyze a penalized D-trace loss function approach in the frequency domain for differential graph learning, using Wirtinger calculus. We consider both convex (group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented to optimize the objective function. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm) and graph recovery. Both synthetic and real data examples are presented in support of the proposed approaches. In synthetic data examples, our log-sum-penalized differential time-series graph estimator significantly outperformed our lasso based differential time-series graph estimator which, in turn, significantly outperformed an existing lasso-penalized i.i.d. modeling approach, with $F_1$ score as the performance metric.</description>

      <title>Orbit recovery under the rigid motions group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the orbit recovery problem under the rigid-motion group SE(n), where the objective is to reconstruct an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations subjected to unknown rotations and translations. This problem is fundamental in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology.
  Our main theoretical contribution is bounding the sample complexity of this problem. We show that if the d-th order moment under the rotation group SO(n) uniquely determines the signal orbit, then orbit recovery under SE(n) is achievable with $N\gtrsim \sigma^{2d+4}$ samples as the noise variance $\sigma^2 \to \infty$. The key technical insight is that the d-th order SO(n) moments can be explicitly recovered from (d+2)-order SE(n) autocorrelations, enabling us to transfer known results from the rotation-only setting to the rigid-motion case. We further harness this result to derive a matching bound to the sample complexity of the multi-target detection model that serves as an abstract framework for electron-microscopy-based technologies in structural biology, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).
  Beyond theory, we present a provable computational pipeline for rigid-motion orbit recovery in three dimensions. Starting from rigid-motion autocorrelations, we extract the SO(3) moments and demonstrate successful reconstruction of a 3-D macromolecular structure. Importantly, this algorithmic approach is valid at any noise level, suggesting that even very small macromolecules, long believed to be inaccessible using structural biology electron-microscopy-based technologies, may, in principle, be reconstructed given sufficient data.</description>

      <title>On Conditional Independence Graph Learning From Multi-Attribute Gaussian Dependent Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian time series from multi-attribute data is considered. Existing methods for graph estimation for such data are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar time series with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Precoding Design for Limited-Feedback MIMO Systems via Character-Polynomial Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication with limited feedback, where the transmitter relies on a limited number of bits associated with the channel state information (CSI), available at the receiver (CSIR) but not at the transmitter (no CSIT), sent via the feedback link. We demonstrate how character-polynomial (CP) codes, a class of analog subspace codes (also, referred to as Grassmann codes) can be used for the corresponding quantization problem in the Grassmann space. The proposed CP codebook-based precoding design allows for a smooth trade-off between the number of feedback bits and the beamforming gain, by simply adjusting the rate of the underlying CP code. We present a theoretical upper bound on the \textit{mean squared quantization error} of the CP codebook for Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) communication system and utilize it to upper bound the resulting \textit{distortion} with perfect CSIT. We show that the distortion vanishes asymptotically. We compute the EGT baseline gain for MIMO systems with two receive antennas and observe that the CP gain approaches the EGT gain for MIMO system. The results are also confirmed via simulations for different types of fading models for both uncorrelated and correlated channels in the MISO and MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beamfocusing, Localization, and Channel Estimation with Modular Linear Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how near-field beamfocusing can be achieved using a modular linear array (MLA), composed of multiple widely spaced uniform linear arrays (ULAs). The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard ULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field beamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional far-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular interval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA and show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each constituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates from each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and that MLAs achieve near-field beamfocusing with a limited number of antennas, making them a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the passage of light through a system of waveplates mathematically in terms of quaternions, an extension of the complex numbers, instead of the more usual Jones vectors and Jones matrices. Both the light beam and the waveplate are represented by a quaternion. It is possible to manipulate the quaternion expression more readily than the Jones matrix-vector expression; for example it can be inverted. The quaternion form of a waveplate is compactly related to its retardance and fast/slow axes, and the quaternion of a signal is closely related to its state of polarization (SOP), either expressed as a vector on the Poincar\'e sphere or as a polarization ellipse. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or change the SOP. Several mathematical tools are identified, such as partial conjugation, to rearrange a quaternion expression, a tricky operation because multiplication does not commute. Put together, these advances let us understand how waveplates can act on a light beam to produce desired behavior. Finally, the quaternion math is put to work on two problems. A new endless optical phase shift system is designed out of waveplates. A prior solution to the problem used five waveplates, and in this paper the same task is done with only three waveplates. Also, failures of a polarization controller are studied, and found to be caused by singularities, which can occur frequently.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoding Revisited: Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective for MU-MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: This letter presents a low-complexity hybrid precoding framework for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging a low-dimensional subspace property. Under the low-dimensional subspace perspective, we first identify an unconstrained optimal radio-frequency (RF) precoder. We then optimize a hybrid precoder via a reduced-complexity precoding method. We further extend the proposed framework to (i) a dynamic-subarray antenna partitioning algorithm that adaptively allocates subsets of antennas associated with RF chains, and (ii) a channel covariance-based approach to exploit statistical channel state information at a transmitter (CSIT), ensuring robustness with partial CSIT. Simulations validate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance while significantly reducing complexity compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Prior Split Gibbs Sampling for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging under Incomplete Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Generalized Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Extension to Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Near-Pilotless Single Carrier Communications Using Matrix Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single Input-Multiple Output (SIMO) systems are key enablers of high data rates in the next generation wireless communications. However in SIMO systems, channel estimation and equalization are challenging particularly in the presence of rapidly changing channels. The high pilot overhead required for channel estimation can reduce the system throughput for large antenna configuration. In this paper, we provide an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm for near-pilotless or blind decoding of SIMO signals, in a single carrier system with frequency domain equalization. This novel approach replaces the standard equalization and estimates both the transmitted data and the channel without the knowledge of any prior distributions, by making use of only one pilot. Our simulations demonstrate improved performance, in terms of error rates, compared to the more widely used pilot-based Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) method.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Then-Beamforming: Robust Transmission Design for RIS-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the warden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain due to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISACC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISACC systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter analyzes the effects of power amplifiers (PAs) on the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO systems. We model signal transmission incorporating nonlinear PA distortion and derive a unified spectral efficiency (SE) expression applicable to arbitrary precoding schemes. To combat PA-induced performance degradation, a joint optimization approach for user association and max-min power control is proposed. Furthermore, a low-complexity alternative is developed to approximate the joint optimization with reduced computational overhead. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approaches over conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</description>

      <title>K-DAREK: Distance Aware Error for Kurkova Kolmogorov Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are powerful parametric function approximators, while Gaussian processes (GPs) are nonparametric probabilistic models that place distributions over functions via kernel-defined correlations but become computationally expensive for large-scale problems. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), semi-parametric neural architectures, model complex functions efficiently using spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend KANs by replacing the early spline layers with multi-layer perceptrons that map inputs into higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations, which yield more stable training and provide robust architectures for system modeling. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks (K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to its nearest training points. In safe control case studies, we demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times more computationally efficient than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than GP as data size increases, and 7.2% safer than our previous work distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK). Moreover, on real data (e.g., Real Estate Valuation), K-DAREK's error bound achieves zero coverage violations.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS enables mapping ultrasound Doppler frames to super-resolution blood flow images, achieving 25-{\mu}m spatial and 0.2-s temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.</description>
