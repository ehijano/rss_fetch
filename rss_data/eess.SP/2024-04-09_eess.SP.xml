      <title>Condition Monitoring with Incomplete Data: An Integrated Variational Autoencoder and Distance Metric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condition monitoring of industrial systems is crucial for ensuring safety and maintenance planning, yet notable challenges arise in real-world settings due to the limited or non-existent availability of fault samples. This paper introduces an innovative solution to this problem by proposing a new method for fault detection and condition monitoring for unseen data. Adopting an approach inspired by zero-shot learning, our method can identify faults and assign a relative health index to various operational conditions. Typically, we have plenty of data on normal operations, some data on compromised conditions, and very few (if any) samples of severe faults. We use a variational autoencoder to capture the probabilistic distribution of previously seen and new unseen conditions. The health status is determined by comparing each sample's deviation from a normal operation reference distribution in the latent space. Faults are detected by establishing a threshold for the health indexes, allowing the model to identify severe, unseen faults with high accuracy, even amidst noise. We validate our approach using the run-to-failure IMS-bearing dataset and compare it with other methods. The health indexes generated by our model closely match the established descriptive model of bearing wear, attesting to the robustness and reliability of our method. These findings highlight the potential of our methodology in augmenting fault detection capabilities within industrial domains, thereby contributing to heightened safety protocols and optimized maintenance practices.</description>

      <title>Real-Valued 2-D Direction of Arrival Estimation via Sparse Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many advantages of direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) in sparse representation domain, they have high computational complexity. This paper presents a new method for real-valued 2-D DOAs estimation of sources in a uniform circular array configuration. This method uses a transformation based on phase mode excitation in uniform circular arrays which called real beamspace L1-SVD (RB-L1SVD). This unitary transformation converts complex manifold matrix to real one, so that the computational complexity is decreased with respect to complex valued computations,its computation, at least, is one,fourth of the complex-valued case; moreover, some benefits from using this transformation are robustness to array imperfections, a better noise suppression because of exploiting an additional real structure, and etc. Numerical results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed approach over previous techniques such as C-L1SVD, RB-ESPRIT, and RB-MUSIC, especially in low signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Interference Management for Full-Duplex ISAC in B5G/6G Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been visioned as a key technique for B5G/6G networks. To support monostatic sensing, a full-duplex radio is indispensable to extract echo signals from targets. Such a radio can also greatly improve network capacity via full-duplex communications. However, full-duplex radios in existing ISAC designs are mainly focused on wireless sensing, while the ability of full-duplex communications is usually ignored. In this article, we provide an overview of full-duplex ISAC (FD-ISAC), where a full-duplex radio is used for both wireless sensing and full-duplex communications in B5G/6G networks, with a focus on the fundamental interference management problem in such networks. First, different ISAC architectures are introduced, considering different full-duplex communication modes and wireless sensing modes. Next, the challenging issues of link-level interference and network-level interference are analyzed, illustrating a critical demand on interference management for FD-ISAC. Potential solutions to interference management are then reviewed from the perspective of radio architecture design, beamforming, mode selection, and resource allocation. The corresponding open problems are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Pseudo MIMO (pMIMO): An Energy and Spectral Efficient MIMO-OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an energy and spectral efficient multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) transmission scheme designed for the future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks. The approach involves connecting each receiving radio frequency (RF) chain with multiple antenna elements and conducting sample-level adjustments for receiving beamforming patterns. The proposed system architecture and the dedicated signal processing methods enable the scheme to transmit a bigger number of parallel data streams than the number of receiving RF chains, achieving a spectral efficiency performance close to that of a fully digital (FD) MIMO system with the same number of antenna elements, each equipped with an RF chain. We refer to this system as a ''pseudo MIMO'' system due to its ability to mimic the functionality of additional invisible RF chains. The article begins with introducing the underlying principles of pseudo MIMO and discussing potential hardware architectures for its implementation. We then highlight several advantages of integrating pseudo MIMO into next-generation wireless networks. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed pseudo MIMO transmission scheme to conventional MIMO systems, simulation results are presented. Additionally, we validate the feasibility of this new scheme by building the first pseudo MIMO prototype. Furthermore, we present some key challenges and outline potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Transmit and Receive Antenna Port Selection for Channel Capacity Maximization in Fluid-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a discrete optimization problem, namely, the maximization of channel capacity in fluid multiple-input multiple-output (fluid-MIMO) systems through the selection of antenna ports/positions at the transmitter and the receiver. First, we present a new joint convex relaxation (JCR) problem by using an upper bound on the channel capacity and exploiting the binary nature of optimization variables. Then, we develop and analyze two optimization algorithms with different performance-complexity tradeoffs: the first is based on JCR and reduced exhaustive search (JCR&amp;RES), while the second on JCR and alternating optimization (JCR&amp;AO). Finally, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform two baseline schemes, the random port selection and the conventional MIMO setup.</description>

      <title>Flow Fusion, Exploiting Measurement Redundancy for Smarter Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In petroleum production systems, continuous multiphase flow rates are essential for efficient operation. They provide situational awareness, enable production optimization, improve reservoir management and planning, and form the basis for allocation. Furthermore, they can be crucial to ensure a fair revenue split between stakeholders for complex production systems where operators share the facilities. Yet, due to complex multiphase flow dynamics and uncertain subsurface fluid properties, the flow rates are challenging to obtain with high accuracy. Consequently, flow rate measurement and estimation solutions, such as multiphase flow meters and virtual flow meters, have different degrees of accuracy and suitability, and impact production decisions and production allocation accordingly.
  We propose a field-proven, data-driven framework for reconciliation and allocation. With data validation and reconciliation as the theoretical backbone, the solution exploits measurement redundancy to fuse together relevant flow rate information to infer the most likely flow rates in the production system based on quantifiable uncertainties. The framework consists of four modules: data-processing, uncertainty estimation, reconciliation, and gross error detection. The latter, being the focus of this paper, is a means to identify and mitigate the effect of measurements subject to systematic error, which can invalidate the reconciliation.
  In this paper, we highlight that a combination of statistical tests and supporting logic for gross error detection and elimination can be beneficial in obtaining a more justifiable production allocation. Using the maximum power measurement test, the module can be limited in its ability to pinpoint the erroneous measurement. Yet, it is demonstrated that the detections can be convenient indications of gross errors and where these might reside in the production system.</description>

      <title>Sustainable and Precision Agriculture with the Internet of Everything (IoE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated pace of global population growth underscores the crucial role of the agricultural sector in mitigating food scarcity, as well as in supporting livelihoods through employment opportunities and bolstering national economies. This sector faces several critical challenges, including resource depletion, socioeconomic issues, gaps in technology and innovation, and the impact of climate change. The introduction of mechanization has significantly transformed agriculture by enhancing sustainability and increasing the productivity of crops. Recently, traditional farming methods have been supplemented with advanced technologies steering the industry towards precision agriculture. The convergence of these advanced technologies has facilitated the automation of various tasks such as water management, crop monitoring, disease management, and harvesting. The concept of Internet of Everything (IoE) has gained traction due to its holistic approach towards integrating various IoT specializations, called IoXs where X referring to a specific domain. This includes areas like the Internet of Sensors (IoS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Internet of Energy (IoEn), Internet of Space Things (IoST), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Internet of Drones (IoD). This paper explores the potential of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in revolutionizing agricultural systems. The focus is on assessing the impact of cutting-edge and novel technologies, such as 6G, molecular communication (MC), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), Internet of Fungus, and designer phages, in significantly improving agricultural yield, efficiency, and productivity. Additionally, the potential of these technologies is evaluated in terms of their applicability, associated challenges, and future research directions within the realm of precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic In-Context Learning for Energy-Efficient MIMO Symbol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a property demonstrated by transformer-based sequence models, refers to the automatic inference of an input-output mapping based on examples of the mapping provided as context. ICL requires no explicit learning, i.e., no explicit updates of model weights, directly mapping context and new input to the new output. Prior work has proved the usefulness of ICL for detection in MIMO channels. In this setting, the context is given by pilot symbols, and ICL automatically adapts a detector, or equalizer, to apply to newly received signals. However, the implementation tested in prior art was based on conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), which may prove too energy-demanding to be run on mobile devices. This paper evaluates a neuromorphic implementation of the transformer for ICL-based MIMO detection. This approach replaces ANNs with spiking neural networks (SNNs), and implements the attention mechanism via stochastic computing, requiring no multiplications, but only logical AND operations and counting. When using conventional digital CMOS hardware, the proposed implementation is shown to preserve accuracy, with a reduction in power consumption ranging from $5.4\times$ to $26.8\times$, depending on the model sizes, as compared to ANN-based implementations.</description>

      <title>Interference Reduction Design for Improved Multitarget Detection in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of wireless communication systems toward 5G and beyond is spurred by the demand for high data rates, exceedingly dependable low-latency communication, and extensive connectivity that aligns with sensing requisites such as advanced high-resolution sensing and target detection. Consequently, embedding sensing into communication has gained considerable attention. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for optimizing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) waveform for target detection by concurrently maximizing the power of the communication signal at an intended user and minimizing the multi-user and sensing interference. We formulate the problem as a non-disciplined convex programming (NDCP) optimization and we use a distribution-based approach for interference cancellation. Precisely, we establish the distribution of the communication signal and the multi-user communication interference received by the intended user, and thereafter, we establish that the sensing interference can be distributed as a centralized Chi-squared if the sensing covariance matrix is idempotent. We design such a matrix based on the symmetrical idempotent property. Additionally, we propose a disciplined convex programming (DCP) form of the problem, and using successive convex approximation (SCA), we show that the solutions can reach a stable waveform for efficient target detection. Furthermore, we compare the proposed waveform with state of the art radar-communication waveform designs and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Edge AI Inference over Cloud-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based collaborative edge AI inference architecture is proposed. Specifically, geographically distributed devices capture real-time noise-corrupted sensory data samples and extract the noisy local feature vectors, which are then aggregated at each remote radio head (RRH) to suppress sensing noise. To realize efficient uplink feature aggregation, we allow each RRH receives local feature vectors from all devices over the same resource blocks simultaneously by leveraging an over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique. Thereafter, these aggregated feature vectors are quantized and transmitted to a central processor (CP) for further aggregation and downstream inference tasks. Our aim in this work is to maximize the inference accuracy via a surrogate accuracy metric called discriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of different classes in the feature space. The key challenges lie on simultaneously suppressing the coupled sensing noise, AirComp distortion caused by hostile wireless channels, and the quantization error resulting from the limited capacity of fronthaul links. To address these challenges, this work proposes a joint transmit precoding, receive beamforming, and quantization error control scheme to enhance the inference accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed optimization algorithm compared to various baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Massive MIMO System with Dynamic Clustering in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) system for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is introduced as a promising technique to provide broadband connectivity. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in implementing distributed mMIMO systems for LEO satellite networks. These challenges include providing scalable massive access implementation as the system complexity increases with network size. Another challenging issue is the asynchronous arrival of signals at the user terminals due to the different propagation delays among distributed antennas in space, which destroys the coherent transmission, and consequently degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed mMIMO system for LEO satellite networks based on dynamic user-centric clustering. Aiming to obtain scalable implementation, new algorithms for initial cooperative access, cluster selection, and cluster handover are provided. In addition, phase shift-aware precoding is implemented to compensate for the propagation delay phase shifts. The performance of the proposed user-centric distributed mMIMO is compared with two baseline configurations: the non-cooperative transmission systems, where each user connects to only a single satellite, and the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems, where all satellites contribute serving each user. The numerical results show the potential of the proposed distributed mMIMO system to enhance system spectral efficiency when compared to noncooperative transmission systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to minimize the serving cluster size for each user, thereby reducing the overall system complexity in comparison to the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radar Perception via Multi-Task Learning: Towards Refined Data for Sensor Fusion Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar and camera fusion yields robustness in perception tasks by leveraging the strength of both sensors. The typical extracted radar point cloud is 2D without height information due to insufficient antennas along the elevation axis, which challenges the network performance. This work introduces a learning-based approach to infer the height of radar points associated with 3D objects. A novel robust regression loss is introduced to address the sparse target challenge. In addition, a multi-task training strategy is employed, emphasizing important features. The average radar absolute height error decreases from 1.69 to 0.25 meters compared to the state-of-the-art height extension method. The estimated target height values are used to preprocess and enrich radar data for downstream perception tasks. Integrating this refined radar information further enhances the performance of existing radar camera fusion models for object detection and depth estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>SUPPLY: Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement Algorithm for Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for a wide range of applications. Due to characteristics such as the ability to hover and carry cargo on-board, rotary-wing UAVs have been considered suitable platforms for carrying communications nodes, including Wi-Fi Access Points and cellular Base Stations. This gave rise to the concept of Flying Networks (FNs), now making part of the so-called Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) defined in 3GPP. In scenarios where the deployment of terrestrial networks is not feasible, the use of FNs has emerged as a solution to provide wireless connectivity. However, the management of the communications resources in FNs imposes significant challenges, especially regarding the positioning of the UAVs so that the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to the Ground Users (GUs) and devices is maximized. Moreover, unlike terrestrial networks that are directly connected to the power grid, UAVs typically rely on on-board batteries that need to be recharged. In order to maximize the UAVs' flying time, the energy consumed by the UAVs needs to be minimized. When it comes to multi-UAV placement, most state-of-the-art solutions focus on maximizing the coverage area and assume that the UAVs keep hovering in a fixed position while serving GUs. Also, they do not address the energy-aware multi-UAV placement problem in networking scenarios where the GUs may have different QoS requirements and may not be uniformly distributed across the area of interest. In this work, we propose the Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement (SUPPLY) algorithm. SUPPLY defines the energy and performance-aware positioning of multiple UAVs in an FN. To accomplish this, SUPPLY defines trajectories that minimize UAVs' energy consumption, while ensuring the targeted QoS levels. The obtained results show up to 25% energy consumption reduction with minimal impact on throughput and delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast generative modeling approach for resistive memories that reproduces the complex statistical properties of real-world devices. To enable efficient modeling of analog circuits, the model is implemented in Verilog-A. By training on extensive measurement data of integrated 1T1R arrays (6,000 cycles of 512 devices), an autoregressive stochastic process accurately accounts for the cross-correlations between the switching parameters, while non-linear transformations ensure agreement with both cycle-to-cycle (C2C) and device-to-device (D2D) variability. Benchmarks show that this statistically comprehensive model achieves read/write throughputs exceeding those of even highly simplified and deterministic compact models.</description>

      <title>Pattern Synthesis via Complex-Coefficient Weight Vector Orthogonal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.06716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new array response control scheme named complex-coefficient weight vector orthogonal decomposition ($ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $) and its application to pattern synthesis. The proposed $ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $ algorithm is a modified version of the existing WORD approach. We extend WORD by allowing a complex-valued combining coefficient in $ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $, and find the optimal combining coefficient by maximizing white noise gain (WNG). Our algorithm offers a closed-from expression to precisely control the array response level of a given point starting from an arbitrarily-specified weight vector. In addition, it results less pattern variations on the uncontrolled angles. Elaborate analysis shows that the proposed $ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $ scheme performs at least as good as the state-of-the-art $\textrm{A}^\textrm{2}\textrm{RC} $ or WORD approach. By applying $ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $ successively, we present a flexible and effective approach to pattern synthesis. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of $ \textrm{C}^2\textrm{-WORD} $ in array response control as well as pattern synthesis.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications for mmWave Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system operating at the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Specifically, the ISAC system combines communication and radar operations and performs, detecting and communicating simultaneously with multiple targets and users. The IRS dynamically controls the amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to reconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate of the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC) matrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase shift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the desired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate coupling, and thus we decompose it into two separate subproblems. First, a closed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar waveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the subproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the communication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS phase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold optimization (MO). Also, we derive a closed-form solution for the formulated problem, effectively decreasing computational complexity. Furthermore, a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the performance of communication and sensing. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate that the IRS can improve the performance of the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Input Distribution Optimization in OFDM Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely adopted in dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, where radar and communications are performed simultaneously with a common signal. However, with random communication symbols (CS) in DFRC, the transmit signal has a random ambiguity function that affects the radar's range-velocity estimation performance, whose influence is remained uncovered. Hence, this paper focuses on minimizing the outlier probability (OP) -- the probability of incorrectly estimating a target's range-velocity bin -- in OFDM DFRC w.r.t the CS probability distribution (i.e., the \emph{input distribution}). Conditioned on the CSs, the OP only depends on the CS magnitudes. Hence, we consider the following two schemes for the above optimization: CSs with (1) constant magnitude (phase shift keying input), and (2) random magnitude (Gaussian input). For (1), the problem reduces to the familiar power allocation design across OFDM's subcarriers and symbols, with uniform power allocation across subcarriers and a \emph{windowed} power allocation across symbols being near-optimal. For (2), the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution at each subcarrier is optimized, with an additional communication constraint to avoid the zero-variance solution where no CSs are carried. We observe that subcarriers with strong communication channels feature strong variance (i.e., favour communications) while the others are characterized by a strong mean (favouring radar). However, the overall power allocation (i.e., the sum of mean and variance) across the OFDM subcarriers and symbols is similar to (1). Simulations show that CSs with random magnitudes degrade the sensing performance, but can be compensated significantly with the proposed input distribution optimization.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>Fairness Scheduling in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with $L$ remote radio units, each with $M$ antennas, serving $K_{\rm tot}$ user equipments (UEs). Most of the literature considers the regime $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$, where the $K$ UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas, but users are not all active at the same time. To achieve high sum SE and handle $K_{\rm tot} \gg ML$, users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\rm act} \leq K_{\rm tot}$ must be chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. Intermittent user activity imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding which prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. To obtain a tractable problem, we make a decoupling assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE $k$ receiver. We approximately enforce this condition with a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is robust to system model uncertainties and can be easily implemented in practice.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Domain Inversion for the Modulo Radon Transform</title>

Abstract: Inspired by the multiple-exposure fusion approach in computational photography, recently, several practitioners have explored the idea of high dynamic range (HDR) X-ray imaging and tomography. While establishing promising results, these approaches inherit the limitations of multiple-exposure fusion strategy. To overcome these disadvantages, the modulo Radon transform (MRT) has been proposed. The MRT is based on a co-design of hardware and algorithms. In the hardware step, Radon transform projections are folded using modulo non-linearities. Thereon, recovery is performed by algorithmically inverting the folding, thus enabling a single-shot, HDR approach to tomography. The first steps in this topic established rigorous mathematical treatment to the problem of reconstruction from folded projections. This paper takes a step forward by proposing a new, Fourier domain recovery algorithm that is backed by mathematical guarantees. The advantages include recovery at lower sampling rates while being agnostic to modulo threshold, lower computational complexity and empirical robustness to system noise. Beyond numerical simulations, we use prototype modulo ADC based hardware experiments to validate our claims. In particular, we report image recovery based on hardware measurements up to 10 times larger than the sensor's dynamic range while benefiting with lower quantization noise ($\sim$12 dB).</description>

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) has attracted considerable attention due to its wide bandwidth and high frequency. However, it is highly susceptible to blockages, resulting in significant degradation of the coverage and the sum rate. A promising approach is deploying distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can establish extra communication links. In this paper, we investigate the impact of distributed RISs on the coverage probability and the sum rate in mmWave wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first introduce the system model, which includes the blockage, the RIS and the user distribution models, leveraging the Poisson point process. Then, we define the association criterion and derive the conditional coverage probabilities for the two cases of direct association and reflective association through RISs. Finally, we combine the two cases using Campbell's theorem and the total probability theorem to obtain the closed-form expressions for the ergodic coverage probability and the sum rate. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach, demonstrating that the deployment of distributed RISs significantly improves the ergodic coverage probability by 45.4% and the sum rate by over 1.5 times.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the millimeter-wave (mmWave) near-field beam training problem to find the correct beam direction. In order to address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first design a set of sparse bases based on the polar domain sparsity of the near-field channel. Then, the random hash functions are chosen to construct the near-field multi-arm beam training codebook. Each multi-arm beam codeword is scanned in a time slot until all the predefined codewords are traversed. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to distinguish the signal from different base stations and obtain correctly aligned beams. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can reduce the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level, and achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of exhaustive beam training. Moreover, we also verify applicability under the far-field scenario.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Beam Training for Multi-RIS-Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beam training problem in the multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to improve the coverage and the achievable rate. However, existing beam training techniques in mmWave systems suffer from the high complexity (i.e., exponential order) and low identification accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme that reduces the training complexity to the logarithmic order with the high accuracy. Specifically, we first design a generation mechanism for HMB codebooks. Then, we propose a demultiplexing algorithm based on the soft decision to distinguish signals from different RIS reflective links. Finally, we utilize a multi-round voting mechanism to align the beams. Simulation results show that the proposed HMB training scheme enables simultaneous training for multiple RISs and multiple users, and reduces the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level. Moreover, it also shows that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification accuracy by at least 20% compared to existing beam training techniques.</description>
