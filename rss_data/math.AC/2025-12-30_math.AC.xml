      <description>arXiv:2512.22595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative noetherian local ring. In this paper, we study the self-duality and eventual periodicity of minimal free resolutions of finitely generated $R$-modules in terms of their syzygy modules and Ext modules. As an application, we recover theorems of Dey.</description>

      <title>Waldschmidt constant of monomial ideals and Simis ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Cooper et al. proposed a conjecture providing a lower bound for the Waldschmidt constant of monomial ideals. We confirm this conjecture for some classes of monomial ideals. Recently, M\'endez, Pinto, and Villarreal formulated a conjecture stating that if $I$ is a monomial ideal without embedded associated primes, whose irreducible decomposition is minimal and which is a Simis ideal, then there exist a Simis squarefree monomial ideal $J$ and a standard linear weighting $w$ such that $I = J_{w}.$ In this work, we verify this conjecture for some classes of monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver Ideals and the Irreducible Components of the Variety of Orthogonal Representations of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$ and a positive integer $d$, one can associate to $G$ the Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver ideal $L_{G}(d)$, an ideal generated by quadratic polynomials coming from orthogonality conditions. The corresponding variety $\mathbb{V}(L_{G}(d))$, denoted $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, is the variety of orthogonal representations of the complement graph $\overline{G}$: its points are maps from the vertex set of $G$ to $\mathbb{K}^{d}$ that send adjacent vertices of $G$ to orthogonal vectors. In this paper we study the irreducible decomposition of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$ and the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. Our main focus is the case in which $G$ is a forest. Under this assumption, we determine the irreducible components of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, compute their dimensions, and describe their defining equations, thereby obtaining the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. The key ingredient is a matroid-theoretic framework in which we associate to every forest $G$ a paving matroid $\mathcal{M}(G)$.</description>

      <title>On construction of differential $\mathbb Z$-graded varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative unital algebra $\mathcal O$, a proper ideal $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal O$, and a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O/\mathcal I$, we provide a $\mathbb Z$-graded extension, whose negative part is an arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution of $\mathcal O/ \mathcal I$. This extension is obtained through an algorithm exploiting the explicit homotopy retract data of the arborescent Koszul-Tate resolution, so that the number of homological computations in the construction is significantly reduced. For a positively graded differential variety over $\mathcal O$ that preserves the ideal $\mathcal I$, the extension admits a manifest description in terms of decorated trees and computed data.
  As a by-product, to every Lie--Rinehart algebra over the coordinate ring of an affine variety $ W \subseteq M = \mathbb{C}^d $, one associates an explicit differential $\mathbb{Z}$-graded variety over $M$ whose negative component is the arborescent Koszul--Tate resolution of the coordinate ring $\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_d]/\mathcal I_W$ of $W$, and whose positive component is the universal dg-variety of the given Lie--Rinehart algebra. Concrete examples are given.</description>

      <title>Extremal Behavior of ideals of minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R,\mathfrak m,\mathsf k)$ be either a fiber product or an artinian stretched Gorenstein ring, with $\operatorname{ch}(\mathsf k)\neq 2$ in the latter case. We prove that the ideals of minors of the minimal free resolution of any finitely generated $R$-module are eventually 2-periodic. Moreover, if the embedding dimension of $R$ is at least 3, eventually the ideals of minors become the powers of the maximal ideal, yielding the 1-periodicity. These are analogs of results obtained over complete intersections and Golod rings by Brown, Dao, and Sridhar. We also study the transfer of periodicity between rings. Specifically, we prove that for any local ring $(R,\mathfrak m)$, if $x\in \mathfrak m$ is a super-regular element and $M$ is an $R/(x)$ module whose ideals of minors are asymptotically the powers of the maximal ideal over $R/(x)$, then the same holds for the ideals of minors of $M$ over $R$.</description>

      <title>On local rings of finite syzygy representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We characterize when its completion has an isolated singularity, thereby strengthening the Dao-Takahashi refinement of the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem. We investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from $R$ to its completion. One consequence is a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either $R$ is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective; moreover, every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of $R$ is a direct sum of finite generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</description>

      <title>Differential graded algebras with divided powers and homotopy Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of vector bundles and birational geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically study \emph{hierarchical filtrations} of vector bundles on smooth projective varieties. These are filtrations by saturated subsheaves of equal rank whose successive quotients are torsion sheaves supported in codimension one. The associated numerical invariant, called \emph{hierarchical depth}, measures the maximal length of such filtrations.
  We establish general bounds for hierarchical depth in terms of the determinant class and provide exact formulas for smooth curves and varieties of Picard rank one. A key technical result concerns the commutativity of elementary transforms along disjoint divisors and their role in constructing filtrations.
  For surfaces, we analyze the behavior of hierarchical depth under birational morphisms and prove that it transforms additively along the steps of the minimal model program. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula relating the depth on a surface to that on its minimal model via exceptional divisor contributions.
  As an application, we connect hierarchical depth to degeneracies in algebraic--geometric codes and show that birational simplification via the MMP leads to effective improvements of code parameters. This establishes hierarchical depth as a new bridge between birational geometry, vector bundle theory, and coding theory.</description>
