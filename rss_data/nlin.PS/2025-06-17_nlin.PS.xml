      <title>Fronts and patterns with a dynamic parameter ramp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of a slowly-varying time-dependent parameter on invasion fronts for which an unstable homogeneous equilibrium is invaded by either another homogeneous state or a spatially periodic state. We first explain and motivate our approach by studying asymptotically constant invasion fronts in a scalar FKPP equation with time-dependent parameter which controls the stability of the trivial state. Following recent works in the area, we use a linearized analysis to derive formal predictions for front position and leading-edge spatial decay. We then use a comparison principle approach to establish a rigorous spreading result in the case of an unbounded temporal parameter. We then consider patterned-invasion in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic bifurcation parameter, a prototype for slow passage through a spatio-temporal Hopf instability. Linearized analysis once again gives front position and decay asymptotics, but also the selected spatial wavenumber at the leading edge. We then use a Burger's modulation analysis to predict the slowly-varying wavenumber in the wake of the front. Finally, in both equations, we used the recently developed concept of a space-time memory curve to characterize delayed invasion in the case where the parameter is initially stable before a subsequent slow passage through instability and invasion. We also provide preliminary results studying invasion in other prototypical pattern formation models modified with a dynamic parameter, as well as numerical results for delayed transition between pushed and pulled fronts in Nagumo's equation with dynamic parameter.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several types of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Solitary waves in the complementary generalized ABS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation in 1+1 dimension of the form $ \Psi(x,t) =\Phi(x) \rme^{-\rmi \omega t}$ where the nonlinear interactions are a combination of vector-vector and scalar-scalar interactions with the interaction Lagrangian given by $L_I = \frac{g^2}{(\kappa+1)}[\bar{\psi} \gamma_{\mu}\psi \bar{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} \psi]^{(\kappa+1)/2} - \frac{g^2}{q(\kappa+1)}(\bar{\psi} \psi)^{\kappa+1}$, where $\kappa&gt;0$ and $q&gt;1$. This is the complement of the generalization of the ABS model \cite{abs} that we recently studied \cite{ak} and denoted as the gABS model. We show that like the gABS model, in the complementary gABS models the solitary wave solutions also exist in the entire $(\kappa, q)$ plane and further in both models energy of the solitary wave divided by its charge is
  {\it independent} of the coupling constant $g$. However, unlike the gABS model here all the solitary waves are single humped, any value of $0 &lt; \omega &lt; m$ is allowed and further unlike the gABS model, for this complementary gABS model the solitary wave bound states exist only in case $\kappa \le \kappa_c$, where $\kappa_c$ depends on the value of $q$. Here $\omega$ and $m$ denote frequency and mass, respectively. We discuss the regions of stability of these solutions as a function of $\omega,q,\kappa$ using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Finally we discuss the non-relativistic reduction of the two-parameter family of this complementary generalized ABS model to a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and discuss the stability of the solitary waves in the domain of validity of the modified NLSE.</description>

      <title>Controlled manipulation of solitons in a recirculating fiber loop using external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical solitons are self-sustained wave packets that propagate without distortion due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. Their unique stability underpins key photonic applications while also playing a central role in nonlinear wave physics. However, real-time control over soliton dynamics in non-dissipative systems remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applications in photonic systems. Here, we introduce a fiber-based platform for soliton manipulation, by creating programmable external potentials through synchronous arbitrary phase modulation in a recirculating optical fiber loop. We demonstrate precise soliton trapping, parametric excitation, and coupled multi-soliton interactions, revealing particle-like behavior in excellent agreement with a Hamiltonian description in which solitons are treated as interacting classical particles. The strong analogy with matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates highlights the broader implications of our approach, which provides a versatile experimental tool for the study of nonlinear wave dynamics and engineered soliton manipulation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Band Gap Transmission in Dispersive and Flat Band Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions in photonic non-dispersive (flat) bands remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to yield exotic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate nonlinearity-induced transport of light from a boundary waveguide into photonic lattices with dispersive and flat bands. For the one-dimensional lattice supporting a dispersive band, self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity effectively makes the boundary waveguide phase-matched with the lattice modes, enabling efficient energy transfer above a threshold input power. In contrast, such nonlinear transmission to the flat band modes is inhibited, as demonstrated in a rhombic lattice supporting an isolated flat band. Instead, as the nonlinearity increases, light couples periodically to the lattice edge mode and then gradually spreads into the lattice due to the excitation of the lower dispersive band.</description>

      <title>Amplitude equations for stored spatially heterogeneous states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled evolution equations for the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with distance-constrained non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of the pattern amplitudes. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that the distance restricted connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.</description>

      <title>Collective Excitations of Self-Gravitating Ultralight Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A distinctive feature of ultralight bosonic dark matter is its ability to form a Bose-Einstein condensate with a dense, stationary configuration at the center of galactic halos. In this work, we investigate the internal dynamics of such cores by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations within a fully self-consistent gravitational framework, accounting for both gravitational potential perturbations and local self-interactions. We demonstrate that the solitonic core supports a discrete spectrum of well-defined collective modes. These oscillations characterize the linear response of the core to perturbations and may influence various dynamical processes. We also discuss potential astrophysical implications of these excitations on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</description>
