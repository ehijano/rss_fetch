      <title>A study about who is interested in stock splitting and why: considering companies, shareholders or managers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many misconceptions around stock prices, stock splits, shareholders, investors, and managers behaviour about such informations due to a number of confounding factors. This paper tests hypotheses with a selected database, about the question ''is stock split attractive for companies?'' in another words, ''why companies split their stock?'', ''why managers split their stock?'', sometimes for no benefit, and ''why shareholders agree with such decisions?''. We contribute to the existing knowledge through a discussion of nine events in recent (selectively chosen) years, observing the role of information asymmetries, the returns and traded volumes before and after the event. Therefore, calculating the beta for each sample, it is found that stock splits (i) affect the market and slightly enhance the trading volume in a short-term, (ii) increase the shareholder base for its firm, (iii) have a positive effect on the liquidity of the market. We concur that stock split announcements can reduce the level of information asymmetric. Investors readjust their beliefs in the firm, although most of the firms are mispriced in the stock split year.</description>

      <title>Geometric Dynamics of Consumer Credit Cycles: A Multivector-based Linear-Attention Framework for Explanatory Economic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces geometric algebra to decompose credit system relationships into their projective (correlation-like) and rotational (feedback-spiral) components. We represent economic states as multi-vectors in Clifford algebra, where bivector elements capture the rotational coupling between unemployment, consumption, savings, and credit utilization. This mathematical framework reveals interaction patterns invisible to conventional analysis: when unemployment and credit contraction enter simultaneous feedback loops, their geometric relationship shifts from simple correlation to dangerous rotational dynamics that characterize systemic crises.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Kelly is a Thirder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem was presented by Elga and highlights the role of probabilities in situations with imperfect recall. One approach to solving the Sleeping Beauty problem is to allow Sleeping Beauty to make decisions based on her beliefs, and then characterize what it takes for her decisions to be "rational". In particular, she can be allowed to make monetary bets based on her beliefs, with the assumption that she wants to gain wealth rather than lose it. However, this approach is often coupled with the assumption that Sleeping Beauty should maximize the expected value of her bets. Here, I argue instead that it is rational for Sleeping Beauty to maximize the growth rate of her wealth using the Kelly Criterion, which leads us to the "thirder" position. Furthermore, this position is shown to be "rational" by Dutch book arguments. If Sleeping Kelly only accepts bets that have a growth rate greater than 1 as a "thirder" then she is not vulnerable to Dutch books. By contrast, if Sleeping Beauty takes the "halfer" position, she is vulnerable to Dutch books. If the bets offered to Sleeping Beauty were to be structured differently and lead to non-multiplicative wealth dynamics, she may no longer be a "thirder".</description>

      <title>ESG Signaling on Wall Street in the AI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I identify a new signaling channel in ESG research by empirically examining whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing remains valuable as large institutional investors increasingly shift toward artificial intelligence (AI). Using winsorized ESG scores of S&amp;P 500 firms from Yahoo Finance and controlling for market value of equity, I conduct cross-sectional regressions to test the signaling mechanism. I demonstrate that Environmental, Social, Governance, and composite ESG scores strongly and positively signal higher debt-to-total-capital ratio, both individually and in various combinations. My findings contribute to the growing literature on ESG investing, offering economically meaningful signaling channel with implications for long-term portfolio management amid the rise of AI.</description>
