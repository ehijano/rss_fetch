      <title>Invariant inter-subject relational structures in the human visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a fundamental behavior that different individuals see the world in a largely similar manner. This is an essential basis for humans' ability to cooperate and communicate. However, what are the neuronal properties that underlie these inter-subject commonalities of our visual world? Finding out what aspects of neuronal coding remain invariant across individuals' brains will shed light not only on this fundamental question but will also point to the neuronal coding scheme as the basis of visual perception. Here, we address this question by obtaining intracranial recordings from three cohorts of patients taking part in a different visual recognition task (overall 19 patients and 244 high-order visual contacts included in the analyses) and examining the neuronal coding scheme most consistent across individuals' visual cortex. Our results highlight relational coding - expressed by the set of similarity distances between profiles of pattern activations - as the most consistent representation across individuals. Alternative coding schemes, such as population vector coding or linear coding, failed to achieve similar inter-subject consistency. Our results thus support relational coding as the central neuronal code underlying individuals' shared perceptual content in the human brain.</description>

      <title>An Adaptively Weighted Averaging Method for Regional Time Series Extraction of fMRI-based Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain decoding that classifies cognitive states using the functional fluctuations of the brain can provide insightful information for understanding the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing.</description>

      <title>Chaotic synchronization in adaptive networks of pulse-coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of phase-oscillators are known to exhibit a variety of collective regimes. Here, we show that a simple mean-field model involving two heterogenous populations of pulse-coupled oscillators, exhibits, in the strong-coupling limit, a robust irregular macroscopic dynamics. The resulting, strongly synchronized, regime is sustained by a homeostatic mechanism induced by the shape of the phase-response curve combined with adaptive coupling strength, included to account for energy dissipated by the pulse emission. The proposed setup mimicks a neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of motor-evoked potential recruitment curves yields accurate and robust estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic stimulation probes and modulates the neural systems that control movement. Key to understanding their effects is the muscle recruitment curve, which maps evoked potential size against stimulation intensity. Current methods to estimate curve parameters require large samples; however, obtaining these is often impractical due to experimental constraints. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that accounts for small samples, handles outliers, simulates high-fidelity data, and returns a posterior distribution over curve parameters that quantify estimation uncertainty. It uses a rectified-logistic function that estimates motor threshold and outperforms conventionally used sigmoidal alternatives in predictive performance, as demonstrated through cross-validation. In simulations, our method outperforms non-hierarchical models by reducing threshold estimation error on sparse data and requires fewer participants to detect shifts in threshold compared to frequentist testing. We present two common use cases involving electrical and electromagnetic stimulation data and provide an open-source library for Python, called hbMEP, for diverse applications.</description>
