      <title>On holomorphicity of Hartogs series satisfying algebraic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a formal power series in one variable whose coefficients are holomorphic functions in a given multidimensional complex domain. Assume the following two conditions on the series. (C1) The restriction of the series at each point of a dense subset of the domain converges in an open disk of a fixed radius. (C2) The series is algebraic over the ring of holomophic functions on the direct product space of the domain and the disk. The main theorem of the present note is that the series defines a holomorphic function on the direct product space. We lso give an example where the condition (C2) is essentially necessary.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff distance and metrics on toric singularity types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X,\omega)$, due to the work of Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu, the space of singularity types of $\omega$-psh functions admits a natural pseudo-metric $d_\mathcal S$ that is complete in the presence of positive mass. When restricted to model singularity types, this pseudo-metric is a bona fide metric. In case of the projective space, there is a known one-to-one correspondence between toric model singularity types and convex bodies inside the unit simplex. Hence in this case it is natural to compare the $d_\mathcal S$ metric to the classical Hausdorff metric. We provide precise H\"older bounds, showing that their induced topologies are the same. More generally, we introduce a quasi-metric $d_G$ on the space of compact convex sets inside an arbitrary convex body $G$, with $d_\mathcal S = d_G$ in case $G$ is the unit simplex. We prove optimal H\"older bounds comparing $d_G$ with the Hausdorff metric. Our analysis shows that the H\"older exponents differ depending on the geometry of $G$, with the worst exponents in case $G$ is a polytope, and the best in case $G$ has $C^2$ boundary.</description>

      <title>Mixed Multiple Orthogonal Laurent Polynomials on the Unit Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed orthogonal Laurent polynomials on the unit circle of CMV type are constructed utilizing a matrix of moments and its Gauss--Borel factorization and employing a multiple extension of the CMV ordering. A systematic analysis of the associated multiple orthogonality and biorthogonality relations, and an examination of the degrees of the Laurent polynomials is given. Recurrence relations, expressed in terms of banded matrices, are found. These recurrence relations lay the groundwork for corresponding Christoffel-Darboux kernels and relations, as well as for elucidating the ABC theorem. The paper also develops the theory of diagonal Christoffel and Geronimus perturbations of the matrix of measures. Christoffel formulas are found for both perturbations.</description>

      <title>Visible quasihyperbolic geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by the work of Bonk, Heinonen, and Koskela (Asterisque, 2001), we consider the problem of the equivalence of the Gromov boundary and Euclidean boundary. Our strategy to study this problem comes from the recent work of Bharali and Zimmer (Adv. Math., 2017) and Bracci, Nikolov, and Thomas (Math. Z., 2021). We present the concept of a quaihyperbolic visibility domain (QH-visibility domain) for domains that meet the visibility property in relation to the quasihyperbolic metric. By utilizing this visibility property, we offer a comprehensive solution to this problem. Indeed, we prove that such domains are precisely the QH-visibility domains that have no geodesic loops in the Euclidean closure. Furthermore, we establish a general criterion for a domain to be the QH-visibility domain. Using this criterion, one can determine that uniform domains, John domains, and domains that satisfy quasihyperbolic boundary conditions are QH-visibility domains. We also compare the visibility of hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic metrics for planar hyperbolic domains. As an application of the visibility property, we study the homeomorphic extension of quasiconformal maps. Moreover, we also study the QH-visibility of unbounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we present a few examples of QH-visibility domains that are not John domains or QHBC domains.</description>

      <title>Unbounded visibility domains: metric estimates and an application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit lower bound, in terms of the distance from the boundary, for the Kobayashi metric of a certain class of bounded pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with $\mathcal{C}^2$-smooth boundary using the regularity theory for the complex Monge--Ampere equation. Using such an estimate, we construct a family of unbounded Kobayashi hyperbolic domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ having a certain negative-curvature-type property with respect to the Kobayashi distance. As an application, we prove a Picard-type extension theorem for the latter domains.</description>

      <title>A note on composition operators on the bidisc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a new sufficient condition for the boundedness of the composition operator on the Dirichlet-type space on the disc, via a two dimensional change of variables formula. With the same formula, we characterise the bounded composition operators on the anisotropic Dirichlet-type spaces $\mathfrak{D}_{\vec{a}}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ induced by holomorphic self maps of the bidisc $\mathbb{D}^2$ of the form $\Phi(z_1,z_2)=(\phi_1(z_1),\phi_2(z_2))$. We also consider the problem of boundedness of composition operators $C_{\Phi}:\mathfrak{D}(\mathbb{D}^2)\to A^2(\mathbb{D}^2)$ for general self maps of the bidisc, applying some recent results about Carleson measures on the the Dirichlet space of the bidisc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, the concept of generalized partial-slice monogenic (or regular) functions has been introduced to unify the theory of monogenic functions and of slice monogenic functions over Clifford algebras. Inspired by the work of A. Perotti, in this paper we provide two analogous versions of the Almansi decomposition in this new setting. Additionally, two enhancements of the Fueter-Sce theorem have been obtained for generalized partial-slice regular functions.</description>

      <title>Sendov conjecture, Borcea variance conjectures and Schoenberg inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(z-z_k)$ be a monic complex polynomial of degree $n$. In 1998, Pawlowski [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 350 (1998)] studied the radius $\gamma_n$ of the smallest concentric disk with center at $\tfrac{\sum\limits_{k=1}^nz_k}{n}$ contained at least one critical point of $F(z)$. He showed that $\gamma_n\le \tfrac{2n^\frac{1}{n-1}}{n^\frac{2}{n-1}+1}$. In this paper, we refine Pawlowski's result in the spirit of Borcea variance conjectures and classic Schoenberg inequality, specifically, we show that $\gamma_n\le\sqrt{\tfrac{n-2}{n-1}}$ in a very concise manner. Moreover, we obtain various generalizations of Schoenberg inequalities based on classic Schoenberg inequality including refining Lin-Xie-Zhang's result [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 502 (2021)], which is inspired by the author's recent work on Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities [arXiv:2410.21961] . Finally, we make $D$-companion matrix introduced by Cheung-Ng [Linear Algebra Appl. 432 (2010)] and operator inequalities involved Schatten $p$-norm react so that we provide an additional relationship between the zeros of $F(z)$ and its critical points in the case where all $z_k\ge 0$, which can be regarded as complements of Schmeisser's result [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory 3 (2003)]. By an operator 2-norm identity, we also prove Sendov conjecture with a condition that depends only on $\left( \tfrac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n-1}\left|z_k-z_n\right|^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Representations of braid groups via cyclic covers of the sphere: Zariski closure and arithmeticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$ and $n\geq 3$ be two natural numbers. Given any sequence $\kappa=(k_1,\dots,k_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\gcd(k_1,\dots,k_n,d)=1$, we consider the family of Riemann surfaces obtained from the plane curves defined by $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-b_i)^{k_i}$, where $\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$ are $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{C}$. The monodromy of the cohomology of the fibers of this family provides us with a representation of the pure braid group $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into some symplectic group. By restricting to a specific subspace in the cohomology of the fibers, we obtain a representation $\rho_d$ of $\mathrm{PB}_n$ into a linear algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In a sense, $\rho_d$ is primitive with respect to the parameters $d$ and $\kappa$. The first main result of this paper is a criterion for the Zariski closure of the image of $\rho_d$ to be maximal, and the second main result is a criterion for the image to be an arithmetic lattice in the target group. The latter generalizes previous results of Venkataramana and gives an answer to a question by McMullen.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel asymptotics for Kodaira Laplacians of high power of line bundle over complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple method to prove the heat kernel asymptotics for the Kodaira Laplacian with respect to the high power of a holomorphic Hermitian line bundle $(L,h^L)$ over a possibly non-compact Hermitian manifold $(M,\omega)$. As a consequence, we give a direct proof of the holomorphic Morse inequalities on covering manifolds. Furthermore, we generalize it to the vector bundle via the $L^2$ Le Potier isomorphism and provide an algebraic version of the holomorphic Morse inequalities. The approach used in this work employs a scaling technique and is applicable to $M$ regardless of its compactness.</description>

      <title>On compactness of products of Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study compactness of product of Toeplitz operators with symbols continuous on the closure of the polydisc in terms of behavior of the symbols on the boundary. For certain classes of symbols $f$ and $g$, we show that $T_fT_g$ is compact if and only if $fg$ vanishes on the boundary. We provide examples to show that for more general symbols, the vanishing of $fg$ on the whole polydisc might not imply the compactness of $T_fT_g$. On the other hand, the reverse direction is closely related to the zero product problem for Toeplitz operators on the unit disc, which is still open.</description>
