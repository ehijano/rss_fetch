      <title>Lattice Chiral Fermion without Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our review of the lattice chiral fermion delves into some critical areas of lattice field theory. By abandoning Hermiticity, the non-Hermitian formulation circumvents the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem while maintaining chiral symmetry, a novel approach. Comparing the Wilson and overlap fermions gives insight into how lattice formulations handle chiral symmetry. The Wilson fermion explicitly breaks chiral symmetry to eliminate doublers. In contrast, the overlap fermion restores a modified form of chiral symmetry using the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We investigate how the (1+1)D Wilson fermion relates to the (1+1)D overlap fermion in the Hamiltonian formulation. This connection could provide a clearer physical understanding of how chiral symmetry manifests at the lattice level. Depending on Hermiticity for efficiency, Monte Carlo methods face unique challenges in a non-Hermitian setting. We investigate how to correctly apply this method to non-Hermitian lattice fermions, which is essential for practical simulations. Finally, the review of topological charge is crucial, as topological features in lattice formulations are strongly connected to chiral symmetry, anomalies, and the index theorem.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decay of vector charmonium from the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating decay parameters in lattice simulations is a computationally demanding problem, requiring several volumes and momenta. We explore an alternative approach, where the transition amplitude can be extracted from the spectral decomposition of particular ratios built from correlation functions. This so-called ratio method has the advantage of not needing various irreducible representations or volumes, and it allows us to predict the decay width $\Gamma$ and the energy shift $\epsilon$ of the spectrum directly. In this work, we apply this method to study the hadronic decay $\psi(3770)\to D\bar{D}$ on two CLS $N_\text{f}=2$ ensembles. This approach requires close to on-shell kinematics to work, and we employ twisted boundary conditions to precisely tune the on-shell point. Although our study is yet to approach the continuum limit, we find a value of $\Gamma$ fully compatible to the physical result, and $\epsilon$ informs us by how much our spectrum would shift in a fully dynamical simulation. Besides lattice calculations, many analytical tools have been proposed to understand decay processes. A relatively simple, early example is the ${}^3P_0$ quark model. By fixing its free parameters, we find that it describes well the lattice data for various kinematics.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the chiral crossover transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD with M\"{o}bius domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry in QCD with two light flavors is known to be restored through a crossover transition at a pseudo-critical temperature. However, the temperature dependence of the singlet part of the chiral symmetry and whether it is effectively restored at the same temperature is not well understood. Using (2+1)-flavor QCD configurations generated using the M\"{o}bius domain-wall discretization on an $N_\tau=8$ lattice, we construct suitable observables where the singlet and non-singlet chiral symmetries are disentangled in order to study their temperature dependence across the crossover transition. From the peak of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, we obtain a pseudo-critical temperature $T_{pc}=158.7{}_{{}-2.3}^{{}+2.6}$ MeV where the non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. From a calculation of the topological susceptibility and its temperature dependence we find that the singlet $U_A(1)$ part of the chiral symmetry is not effectively restored at $T&lt;186$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Optimising stochastic algorithms for hadron correlation function computations in lattice QCD using a localised distillation basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distillation is a quark-smearing method for the construction of a broad class of hadron operators useful in lattice QCD computations and defined via a projection operator into a vector space of smooth gauge-covariant fields. A new orthonormal basis for this space is constructed which builds in locality. This basis is useful for the construction of stochastic methods to estimate the correlation functions computed in Monte Carlo calculations relevant for hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Four loop Green's functions involving the $n$ $=$ $2$ moment of the Wilson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the Green's function for the insertion of the second moment of the twist-$2$ flavour nonsinglet Wilson operator in a quark $2$-point function in all three different single scale external momentum configurations at four loops in the MSbar scheme and the chiral limit. One configuration is where the operator is inserted at zero momentum while the other two are where a non-zero momentum flows out through the operator itself with one external quark momentum nullified. In the latter two configurations mixing of the operator with a total derivative twist-$2$ operator is included for renormalization group consistency. In addition we compute the correlation functions of both gauge invariant operators to four loops in the same scheme.</description>

      <title>Compatibility between $e^+e^-$ and $\tau$ decay data in the di-pion channel and implications for $a_\mu^\mathrm{SM}$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have revisited the isospin-breaking corrections relating $\sigma(e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-)$ and $\Gamma(\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau)$. We confirm that the associated uncertainty is under control, so that tau data can also be used to predict accurately the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and precision conserved vector current tests can be carried out.</description>

      <title>Scalar and tensor meson dominance and gravitational form factors of the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent MIT lattice data for the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion which extend up to $Q^2= 2~{\rm GeV}^2$ for $m_\pi=170$~MeV. We show that simple monopole fits comply with the old idea of meson dominance. We use Chiral Perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) to next-to-leading order (NLO) to transform the MIT data to the physical world with $m_\pi=140~$MeV and find that the spin-0 GFF is effectively saturated with the $f_0(600)$ and the spin-2 with the $f_2(1270)$, with monopole masses $m_\sigma= 630(60)$~MeV and $m_{f_2}= 1270(40)$~MeV. We determine in passing the chiral low energy constants (LECs) from the MIT lattice data alone
  $$
  10^3 \cdot L_{11} (m_\rho^2)=1.06(15) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{12} (m_\rho^2)= -2.2(1) \, ,
  \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{13} (m_\rho^2) = -0.7(1.1).
  $$ which agree in sign and order of magnitude with the original estimates by Donoghue and Leutwyler. We also analyze the sum rules based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) that imply that the corresponding spectral functions are not positive definite. We show that these sum rules are strongly violated in a variety of $\pi\pi-K \bar K$ coupled channel Omn\`es-Muskhelishvili calculations. This is not mended by the inclusion of the pQCD tail, suggesting the need for an extra negative spectral strength. Using a simple model implementing all sum rules, we find the expected onset of pQCD at very high momenta.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent and present new results on thermalization of nonabelian gauge theory obtained by exact numerical simulation of the real-time dynamics of two-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We discuss: (1) tests confirming the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis; (2) the entanglement entropy of sublattices, including the Page curve, the transition from area to volume scaling with increasing energy of the eigenstate and its time evolution that shows thermalization of localized regions to be a two-step process; (3) the absence of quantum many-body scars for $j_{\rm max}&gt;1/2$; (4) the spectral form factor, which exhibits the expected slope-ramp-plateau structure for late times; (5) the entanglement Hamiltonian for SU(2), which has properties in accordance with the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem; and (6) a measure for non-stabilizerness or "magic" that is found to reach its maximum during thermalization. We conclude that the thermalization of nonabelian gauge theories is a promising process to establish quantum advantage.</description>
