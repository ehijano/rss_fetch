      <title>Towards Resiliency in Large Language Model Serving with KevlarFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems remain fundamentally fragile, where frequent hardware faults in hyperscale clusters trigger disproportionate service outages in the software stack. Current recovery mechanisms are prohibitively slow, often requiring up to 10 minutes to reinitialize resources and reload massive model weights. We introduce KevlarFlow, a fault tolerant serving architecture designed to bridge the gap between hardware unreliability and service availability. KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Power Grid Frequency Regulation Service with Data Center Load Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML data center growth have led to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions. The shift to renewable energy and growing data center energy demands can destabilize the power grid. Power grids rely on frequency regulation reserves, typically fossil-fueled power plants, to stabilize and balance the supply and demand of electricity. This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary. We demonstrate that data center participation in frequency regulation can result in Exogenous carbon savings that oftentimes outweigh Operational carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>HetCCL: Accelerating LLM Training with Heterogeneous GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models is driving organizations to expand their GPU clusters, often with GPUs from multiple vendors. However, current deep learning frameworks lack support for collective communication across heterogeneous GPUs, leading to inefficiency and higher costs. We present HetCCL, a collective communication library that unifies vendor-specific backends and enables RDMA-based communication across GPUs without requiring driver modifications. HetCCL introduces two novel mechanisms that enable cross-vendor communication while leveraging optimized vendor libraries, NVIDIA NCCL and AMD RCCL. Evaluations on a multi-vendor GPU cluster show that HetCCL matches NCCL and RCCL performance in homogeneous setups while uniquely scaling in heterogeneous environments, enabling practical, high-performance training with both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs without changes to existing deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>CONCUR: High-Throughput Agentic Batch Inference of LLM via Congestion-Based Concurrency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch inference for agentic workloads stresses the GPU key-value (KV) cache in a sustained and cumulative manner, often causing severe throughput degradation well before memory capacity is exhausted. We identify this phenomenon as middle-phase thrashing, a previously under-characterized pathology in which cache efficiency collapses as long-lived agents accumulate state over time.
  We argue that mitigating this pathology requires moving beyond reactive, request-level cache management to proactive, agent-level admission control. Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.
  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems.</description>

      <title>AscendCraft: Automatic Ascend NPU Kernel Generation via DSL-Guided Transcompilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning models critically depends on efficient kernel implementations, yet developing high-performance kernels for specialized accelerators remains time-consuming and expertise-intensive. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.
  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution.</description>

      <title>ERA: Epoch-Resolved Arbitration for Duelling Admins in Group Management CRDTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are used in a range of fields for their coordination-free replication with strong eventual consistency. By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel. As a result, an external arbiter is required to arbitrate an immutable happens-before relation between concurrent events. Arbitration occurs asynchronously in batches via optional ''epoch events'', preserving availability. This introduces a bounded total order within epochs, and the resulting ''finality'' improves on the level of consistency CRDTs can provide.</description>

      <title>FedAdaVR: Adaptive Variance Reduction for Robust Federated Learning under Limited Client Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) encounters substantial challenges due to heterogeneity, leading to gradient noise, client drift, and partial client participation errors, the last of which is the most pervasive but remains insufficiently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>ZK-HybridFL: Zero-Knowledge Proof-Enhanced Hybrid Ledger for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, yet both centralized and decentralized approaches face challenges in scalability, security, and update validation. We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Provably Correct Distributed Protocols Without Human Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Provably correct distributed protocols, which are a critical component of modern distributed systems, are highly challenging to design and have often required decades of human effort. These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.</description>

      <title>SAIR: Cost-Efficient Multi-Stage ML Pipeline Autoscaling via In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-stage ML inference pipelines are difficult to autoscale due to heterogeneous resources, cross-stage coupling, and dynamic bottleneck migration. We present SAIR, an autoscaling framework that uses an LLM as an in-context reinforcement learning controller, improving its policy online from reward-labeled interaction histories without gradient updates. SAIR combines Pareto-dominance reward shaping with a provable separation margin, surprisal-guided experience retrieval for context efficiency, and fine-grained GPU rate control via user-space CUDA interception. We provide regret analysis decomposing error into retrieval coverage and LLM selection components. On four ML serving pipelines under three workload patterns, SAIR achieves the best or tied-best P99 latency and effective resource cost among deployed baselines, improving P99 by up to 50% and reducing effective cost by up to 97% (under GPU rate-control assumptions), with 86% bottleneck detection accuracy and no offline training.</description>

      <title>AsyncMesh: Fully Asynchronous Optimization for Data and Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data and pipeline parallelism are key strategies for scaling neural network training across distributed devices, but their high communication cost necessitates co-located computing clusters with fast interconnects, limiting their scalability. We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates. Experiments on large-scale language models (up to \em 1B parameters) demonstrate that our approach matches the performance of the fully synchronous baseline, while significantly reducing communication overhead.</description>

      <title>SQUAD: Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions via ensemble of early exit neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Split Federated Learning for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Joint Sensing, Communication, Computation, and Control Co-design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated sensing, communication, computation and control (ISC3) capabilities have become key enablers of next-generation wireless networks. Federated edge learning (FEL) leverages UAVs as mobile learning agents to collect data, perform local model updates, and contribute to global model aggregation. However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face critical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks, and inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model training on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges, we propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISC3 (SFLSC3), a novel framework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL. SFLSC3 optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers, significantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis of UAV deployment, split point selection, data sensing volume, and client-side aggregation frequency, deriving closed-form upper bounds for the convergence gap. Based on these insights, we conceive a joint optimization problem to minimize the delay required to achieve a target model accuracy. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently determine UAV deployment, split point selection, and communication frequency. Extensive simulations on a target motion recognition task validate the effectiveness of SFLSC3, demonstrating superior convergence and delay performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>On the Operational Resilience of CBDC: Threats and Prospects of Formal Validation for Offline Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information and communication technologies are by now employed in most human activities, including economics and finance. Modern computers have reached an extraordinary power in terms of information processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission. However, several results of theoretical computer science imply the impossibility of certifying software quality in general. With the exception of safety-critical systems, this has primarily concerned information processed by confined systems, with limited socio-economic consequences. In the emerging era of technologies for exchanging tokenized assets and digital money over the Internet, such as in particular central bank digital currency (CBDC), even a minor bug could trigger a financial collapse. Although the aforementioned impossibility results cannot be overcome in an absolute sense, there exist formal methods that can provide correctness assertions for software system models under suitable conditions. We advocate their use to validate the operational resilience of software infrastructures enabling CBDC, with special emphasis on offline payments as they constitute a very critical issue.</description>

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 &lt; 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.</description>

      <title>CloudFix: Automated Policy Repair for Cloud Access Control Policies Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Access control policies are vital for securing modern cloud computing, where organizations must manage access to sensitive data across thousands of users in distributed system settings. Cloud administrators typically write and update policies manually, which can be an error-prone and time-consuming process and can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches based on symbolic analysis have demonstrated success in automated debugging and repairing access control policies; however, their generalizability is limited in the context of cloud-based access control. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes. Our work is the first to leverage LLMs for policy repair, showcasing the effectiveness of LLMs for access control and enabling efficient and automated repair of cloud access control policies. We make our tool Cloudfix and AWS dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>Spattack: Subgroup Poisoning Attacks on Federated Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRec) have emerged as a promising approach to provide personalized recommendations while protecting user privacy. However, recent studies have shown their vulnerability to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients inject crafted gradients to promote target items to benign users. Existing attacks typically target the full user group, which compromises stealth and increases detection risk. In contrast, real-world adversaries may prefer to target specific user subgroups, such as promoting health supplements to older individuals, to maximize effectiveness while preserving stealth. Motivated by this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first poisoning attack designed to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in federated settings. Spattack adopts an approximate-and-promote paradigm, which approximates user embeddings of target and non-target subgroups and then promotes target items to the target subgroup. We further reveal a trade-off between strong attack performance on the target subgroup and limited impact on the non-target subgroup. To achieve a better trade-off, we propose enhanced approximation and promotion strategies. For approximation, we push embeddings of different subgroups apart via contrastive learning and augment the target subgroup's relevant item set through clustering. For promotion, we align embeddings of target items and relevant items to strengthen their semantic connections, together with an adaptive weighting strategy to balance effects across subgroups. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Spattack achieves strong attack performance on the target subgroup with minimal impact on non-target users, even when only 0.1% of users are malicious. Moreover, Spattack maintains competitive recommendation performance and shows strong resilience against mainstream defenses.</description>

      <title>Readout-Side Bypass for Residual Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.</description>

      <title>LLM-42: Enabling Determinism in LLM Inference with Verified Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.
  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</description>

      <title>Where Do the Joules Go? Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</description>
