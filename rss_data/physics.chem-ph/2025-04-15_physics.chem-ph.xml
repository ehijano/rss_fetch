      <title>Corrosion of metal reinforcements within concrete and localisation of supporting reactions under natural conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrosion in concrete prevents in-situ observation, necessitating models to provide insight into the local reaction currents. We present a computational method for predicting corrosion rates of reinforcements within concrete under natural conditions, i.e. requiring the corrosion current to be supported by equal cathodic currents. In contrast to typical corrosion models, where these two counteracting currents are required to be co-located, we allow these currents to be separated such that pitting corrosion can be supported by cathodic reactions over a much larger area. Pitting corrosion is investigated, elucidating the effects of the concrete porosity and water saturation, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and chlorine concentration within the pore solution. The presented model is capable of capturing the dynamic growth of acidic regions around corrosion pits, showing the limited region over which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs and how this region evolves over time. The ability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased porosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes in the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore solution) play a secondary role. Furthermore, external oxygen is seen to enhance corrosion but is not required to initialise and sustain acidic corrosion pits.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Dynamics with Constrained Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating nuclear quantum effects into nonadiabatic dynamics remains a significant challenge. Herein we introduce new nonadiabatic dynamics approaches based on the recently developed constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (CNEO) theory. The CNEO approach integrates nuclear quantum effects, particularly quantum nuclear delocalization effects, into effective potential energy surfaces. When combined with Ehrenfest dynamics and surface hopping, it efficiently captures both nonadiabaticity and quantum nuclear delocalization effects. We apply these new approaches to a one-dimensional proton-coupled electron transfer model and find that they outperform conventional Ehrenfest dynamics and surface hopping in predicting proton transfer dynamics and proton transmission probabilities, especially in the low momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Evidence for electron spin-torsion coupling in the rotational spectrum of the CH$_3$CO radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-shell non-rigid molecular systems exhibiting an internal rotation are likely candidates for a coupling between the spin angular momentum of the unpaired electron and the torsional motion. This electron spin-torsion coupling lacked both an experimental validation and a theoretical modeling. Here, the first experimental observation of the electron spin-torsion coupling is reported analyzing the pure rotational spectrum at millimeter wavelengths of the CH$_3$CO radical, a $^2\Sigma$ open-shell molecule displaying an internal rotation of its methyl group. To account for this coupling, a specific Hamiltonian incorporating the rotational, torsional, and electronic degrees of freedom is developed and allows us to reproduce the experimental spectrum. The present demonstration of the electron spin-torsion coupling will undoubtedly be key to future investigations of large open-shell molecules exhibiting a complex internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Influence of excitonic coupling, static disorder, and coherent dynamics in action-2D electronic spectroscopy of a molecular dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral features of Action-2D Electronic Spectroscopy (A-2DES) in a molecular dimer model across different regimes of excitonic coupling. By explicitly including a second-excited state for each chromophore, we simulate A-2DES spectra ranging from the non-interacting limit to the strong-coupling case, focusing on the significance of cross peaks. While for weak excitonic coupling, cross peaks can be understood as the incoherent mixing of linear signals of the two chromophores, these features reflect excitonic delocalization as the coupling increases. We highlight that A-2DES offers enhanced sensitivity to coherent excited-state dynamics, particularly in the intermediate-coupling regime, where it provides higher contrast compared to its coherent-detected counterpart. Finally, we show that static disorder reduces the relative amplitude of cross peaks compared to diagonal features in a way that depends on the excitonic coupling. Notably, the relative suppression of cross peaks decreases with the strength of the excitonic coupling, implying that spectral features related to incoherent mixing are less prominent in inhomogeneous samples. These findings support the potential of A-2DES for investigating excitonic dynamics in small multi-chromophoric systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory for Cavitation Inception in the Presence of Gaseous Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory model to predict the cavitation inception pressure and to describe the behavior of nanoscale gaseous nuclei during cavitation. Validation is achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. The findings highlight the significant role of nanoscale gaseous nuclei in lowering the tensile strength required for cavitation initiation. The results show that our enhanced CNT model predicts lower cavitation pressures than the Blake threshold, closely matching molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, our results illustrate that differences between cavitation pressures using the Van der Waals and ideal gas models are greatest for smaller nuclei and lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing excited states in quantum Monte Carlo: A reassessment of double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven to be highly accurate for computing excited states, but the choice of optimization strategies for multiple states remains an active topic of investigation. In this work, we revisit the calculation of double excitation energies in nitroxyl, glyoxal, tetrazine, and cyclopentadienone, exploring different objective functionals and their impact on the accuracy and robustness of QMC. A previous study for these systems employed a penalty functional to enforce orthogonality among the states, but the chosen prefactors did not strictly ensure convergence to the target states. Here, we confirm the reliability of previous results by comparing excitation energies obtained with different functionals and analyzing their consistency. Additionally, we investigate the performance of different functionals when starting from a pre-collapsed excited state, providing insight into their ability to recover the target wave functions.</description>

      <title>Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a photothermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy technique based on a nanoelectromechanical system, which is coupled to a commercial Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (NEMS--FTIR) as a promising solution for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. Polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoparticles with nominal diameters of 100, 54, and 262~nm, respectively, were analyzed by NEMS--FTIR with limits of detection (LoD) of 353~pg for PS, 102~pg for PP, and 355~pg for PVC. The PS mass deposited on the NEMS chips was estimated from the measured absorptance values and the attenuation coefficient of PS. The wide spectral range of the FTIR allowed the identification of individual polymer nanoparticles from a mixture. The potential of NEMS--FTIR for the analysis of real--world samples was evaluated by confirming the presence of polyamide (PA) particles released from commercial tea bags during brewing. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed continuous release of PA particles over time.</description>

      <title>Proteinoid spikes: from protocognitive to universal approximating agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteinoids, as soft matter fluidic systems, are computational substrates that have been recently proposed for their analog computing capabilities. Such systems exhibit oscillatory electrical activity because of cationic and anionic exchange inside and outside such gels. It has also been recently shown that this (analog) electrical activity, when sampled at fixed time intervals, can be used to reveal their underlying information-theoretic, computational code. This code, for instance, can be expressed in the (digital) language of Boolean gates and QR codes. Though, this might seem as a good evidence that proteinoid substrates have computing abilities when subjected to analog-to-digital transition, the leap from their underlying computational code to computing abilities is not well explained yet. How can the electrical activity inside proteinoids, whilst of chemical origin, be able them to perform computational tasks at the first place? In addition, proteinoids are also hypothesised to be the chemical manifestation of the primordial soup, i.e., as potential entities with proto-cognitive abilities. In this work, we show that the proteinoid substrate, owing to its chemical makeup and proto-cognitive abilities, can be interpreted as an universal approximator, thanks to a novel equivalence between the electrical activity exhibited by the substrate and a deep Rectified Linear Unit (deep ReLU) network. We exemplify this equivalence by constructing a prediction algorithm which acts as a binary classification model and extract 16-dimensional vector data from the proteinoid spike, in order to perform predictions with 70.41\% accuracy. We conclude by drawing an equivalence between the the deep ReLU network and the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, whose origin can be traced back to Hilbert's thirteenth problem.</description>

      <title>MACE-OFF: Transferable Short Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Organic Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical empirical force fields have dominated biomolecular simulation for over 50 years. Although widely used in drug discovery, crystal structure prediction, and biomolecular dynamics, they generally lack the accuracy and transferability required for first-principles predictive modeling. In this paper, we introduce MACE-OFF, a series of short range transferable force fields for organic molecules created using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and first-principles reference data computed with a high level of quantum mechanical theory. MACE-OFF demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of short range models by accurately predicting a wide variety of gas and condensed phase properties of molecular systems. It produces accurate, easy-to-converge dihedral torsion scans of unseen molecules, as well as reliable descriptions of molecular crystals and liquids, including quantum nuclear effects. We further demonstrate the capabilities of MACE-OFF by determining free energy surfaces in explicit solvent, as well as the folding dynamics of peptides.Finally, we simulate a fully solvated small protein, observing accurate secondary structure and vibrational spectrum. These developments enable first-principles simulations of molecular systems for the broader chemistry community at high accuracy and relatively low computational cost.</description>

      <title>An accurate and efficient framework for modelling the surface chemistry of ionic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to the surfaces of ionic materials with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is open-source, making it possible to more routinely apply cWFT to complex problems involving the surfaces of ionic materials.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Photochemistry of Cyclobutanone using Ultrafast Electron Diffraction: Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the ultrafast structural dynamics of cyclobutanone following photoexcitation at $\lambda=200$ nm using gas-phase megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. Our investigation complements the simulation studies of the same process within this special issue. It provides information about both electronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable inelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the depopulation of the photoexcited S$_2$ state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg character through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time constant of $(0.29 \pm 0.2)$ ps towards the S$_1$ state. The S$_1$ state population undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while passing through a conical intersection with S$_0$. The corresponding structural changes can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes appear with a delay of $(0.14 \pm 0.05)$ ps with respect the initial photoexcitation, which is less than the S$_2$ depopulation time constant. This behavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once the S$_1$ state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further within $(1.2 \pm 0.2)$ ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene and ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide. Our study showcases both the value of gas-phase ultrafast diffraction studies as an experimental benchmark for nonadiabatic dynamics simulation methods and the limits in the interpretation of such experimental data without comparison to such simulations.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Accuracy Limit of Foundation Neural Network Models with Quantum Monte Carlo Forces and Path Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy to produce highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets (energies and forces) aimed at deriving Foundation Machine Learning models for molecular simulation. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT), a "Jacob's Ladder" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively GPU-accelerated software with increasing accuracy. Thanks to Exascale, this is the first time that the computationally intensive calculation of Quantum Monte Carlo forces (QMC), and the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces with selected-Configuration Interaction wavefunctions, are computed at such scale at the complete basis-set limit. To bridge the gap between accurate QC and condensed-phase Molecular Dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve the DFT-based FeNNix-Bio1 foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled to path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond reactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy. These results demonstrate the promise of Exascale to deepen our understanding of the inner machinery of complex biosystems.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Engineered Phonon Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons (PhPs) in low-symmetry van der Waals materials confine mid-infrared electromagnetic radiation well below the diffraction limit for nanoscale optics, sensing, and energy control. However, controlling the PhP dispersion at the nanoscale through intrinsic material properties$-$without external fields, lithography, or intercalants$-$remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate vacancy-engineered tuning of PhPs in $\alpha$-phase molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO$_3$) via oxygen vacancy formation and lattice strain. Near-field nanoimaging of PhPs in processed $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ reveals an average polariton wavevector modulation of $\Delta k/k \approx 0.13 $ within the lower Restrahlen band. Stoichiometric analysis, density functional theory, and finite-difference time-domain simulations show agreement with the experimental results and suggest an induced vacancy concentration of $1\% - 2\%$ along with $(1.2\pm 0.2)\%$ compressive strain, resulting in a non-volatile dielectric permittivity modulation of up to $\Delta \varepsilon / \varepsilon \approx 0.15$. Despite these lattice modifications, the lifetimes of thermomechanically tuned PhPs remain high at $1.2 \pm 0.31$ ps. These results establish thermomechanical vacancy engineering as a general strategy to reprogram polaritonic response in vdW crystals, offering a new degree of freedom for embedded, non-volatile nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>
