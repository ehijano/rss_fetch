      <title>Self-descriptive Sequences directed by two Periodic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we exhibit a class of self-descriptive sequences that can be explicitly computed and whose frequencies are known. In particular, as a corollary of our main result, we prove that the sequence introduced in \citeBJM23 has the expected frequencies of occurrences.</description>

      <title>Specify What? Enhancing Neural Specification Synthesis by Symbolic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how combinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic analyses can be used to synthesise specifications of C programs. The LLM prompts are augmented with outputs from two formal methods tools in the Frama-C ecosystem, Pathcrawler and EVA, to produce C program annotations in the specification language ACSL. We demonstrate how the addition of symbolic analysis to the workflow impacts the quality of annotations: information about input/output examples from Pathcrawler produce more context-aware annotations, while the inclusion of EVA reports yields annotations more attuned to runtime errors. In addition, we show that the method infers rather the programs intent than its behaviour, by generating specifications for buggy programs and observing robustness of the result against bugs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16413v1 Announce Type: cross

      <description>arXiv:2406.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a construction in a column of a one-dimensional cellular automaton of the Minkowski sum of two sets which can themselves occur in columns of cellular automata. It enables us to obtain another construction of the set of integers that are sums of three squares, answering a question by the same author.</description>

      <title>Switching Controller Synthesis for Hybrid Systems Against STL Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Switching controllers play a pivotal role in directing hybrid systems (HSs) towards the desired objective, embodying a ``correct-by-construction'' approach to HS design. Identifying these objectives is thus crucial for the synthesis of effective switching controllers. While most of existing works focus on safety and liveness, few of them consider timing constraints. In this paper, we delves into the synthesis of switching controllers for HSs that meet system objectives given by a fragment of STL, which essentially corresponds to a reach-avoid problem with timing constraints. Our approach involves iteratively computing the state sets that can be driven to satisfy the reach-avoid specification with timing constraints. This technique supports to create switching controllers for both constant and non-constant HSs. We validate our method's soundness, and confirm its relative completeness for a certain subclass of HSs. Experiment results affirms the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal Turing machine is a powerful concept - a single device can compute any function that is computable. A universal spin model, similarly, is a class of physical systems whose low energy behavior simulates that of any spin system. Our categorical framework for universality (arXiv:2307.06851) captures these and other examples of universality as instances. In this article, we present an accessible account thereof with a focus on its basic ingredients and ways to use it. Specifically, we show how to identify necessary conditions for universality, compare types of universality within each instance, and establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability).</description>

      <title>Completeness Theorems for Kleene algebra with tests and top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two completeness results for Kleene algebra with tests and a top element, with respect to guarded string languages and binary relations. While the equational theories of those two classes of models coincide over the signature of Kleene algebra, this is no longer the case when we consider an additional constant ``top'' for the full element. Indeed, the full relation satisfies more laws than the full language, and we show that those additional laws can all be derived from a single additional axiom. We recover that the two equational theories coincide if we slightly generalise the notion of relational model, allowing sub-algebras of relations where top is a greatest element but not necessarily the full relation. We use models of closed languages and reductions in order to prove our completeness results, which are relative to any axiomatisation of the algebra of regular events. For one of our constructions, we extend the concept of finite monoid recognisability to guarded-string languages; this device makes it possible to obtain a PSpace algorithm for the equational theory of binary relations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Emergency Vehicle Detection using Mel Spectrograms and Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In emergency situations, the high-speed movement of an ambulance through the city streets can be hindered by vehicular traffic. This work presents a method for detecting emergency vehicle sirens in real time. To obtain the audio fingerprint of a Hi-Lo siren, DSP and signal symbolization techniques were applied, which were contrasted against an audio classifier based on a deep neural network, using the same 280 audios of ambient sounds and 52 Hi-Lo siren audios dataset. In both methods, some classification accuracy metrics were evaluated based on its confusion matrix, resulting in the DSP algorithm having a slightly lower accuracy than the DNN model, however, it offers a self-explanatory, adjustable, portable, high performance and lower energy and consumption that makes it a more viable lower cost ADAS implementation to identify Hi-Lo sirens in real time.</description>
