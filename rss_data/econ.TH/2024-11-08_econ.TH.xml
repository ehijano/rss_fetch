      <title>Robust Regulation of Labour Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robust regulation of labour contracts in moral hazard problems. A firm offers a contract to incentivise production by an agent protected by limited liability. A regulator chooses the set of permissible contracts to (i) improve efficiency and (ii) protect the worker. The regulator ignores the agent's productive actions and the firm's costs and evaluates regulation by its worst-case regret. The regret-minimising regulation imposes a linear minimum wage, allowing all contracts above this linear threshold. The slope of the minimum contract balances the worker's protection - by ensuring they receive a minimal share of the production - and the necessary flexibility for incentive provision.</description>

      <title>Sequential optimal contracting in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a principal-agent problem in continuous time with multiple lump-sum payments (contracts) paid at different deterministic times. We reduce the non-zero sum Stackelberg game between the principal and agent to a standard stochastic optimal control problem. We apply our result to a benchmark model for which we investigate how different inputs (payment frequencies, payments' distribution, discounting factors, agent's reservation utility) affect the principal's value and agent's optimal compensations.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Agents through Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal design of ratings to motivate agent investment in quality when transfers are unavailable. The principal designs a rating scheme that maps the agent's quality to a (possibly stochastic) score. The agent has private information about his ability, which determines his cost of investment, and chooses the quality level. The market observes the score and offers a wage equal to the agent's expected quality. For example, a school incentivizes learning through a grading policy that discloses the student's quality to the job market.
  I reduce the principal's problem to the design of an interim wage function of quality. When restricted to deterministic ratings, I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of simple pass/fail tests and lower censorship. In particular, when the principal's objective is expected quality, pass/fail tests are optimal if agents' abilities are concentrated towards the top of the distribution, while pass/lower censorship is optimal if abilities are concentrated towards the mode. The results generalize existing results in optimal delegation with voluntary participation, as pass/fail tests (lower censorship) correspond to take-it-or-leave-it offers (threshold delegation). Additionally, I provide sufficient conditions for deterministic ratings to remain optimal when stochastic ratings are allowed. For quality maximization, pass/fail tests remain optimal if the ability distribution becomes increasingly more concentrated towards the top.</description>

      <title>How to Make an Action Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two actions in a decision problem, a and b, each of which that produces a state-dependent monetary reward, we study how to robustly make action a more attractive. Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at which a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is preferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in money). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications in politics, bilateral trade, insurance, and information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Proportional Fairness in Obnoxious Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the obnoxious facility location problem (in which agents prefer the facility location to be far from them) and propose a hierarchy of distance-based proportional fairness concepts for the problem. These fairness axioms ensure that groups of agents at the same location are guaranteed to be a distance from the facility proportional to their group size. We consider deterministic and randomized mechanisms, and compute tight bounds on the price of proportional fairness. In the deterministic setting, we show that our proportional fairness axioms are incompatible with strategyproofness, and prove asymptotically tight $\epsilon$-price of anarchy and stability bounds for proportionally fair welfare-optimal mechanisms. In the randomized setting, we identify proportionally fair and strategyproof mechanisms that give an expected welfare within a constant factor of the optimal welfare. Finally, we prove existence results for two extensions to our model.</description>
