      <title>On the structure of $T$-$\lambda$-spherical completions of o-minimal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be the theory of an o-minimal field and $T_0$ a common reduct of $T$ and $T_{an}$.
  I adapt Mourgues' and Ressayre's constructions to deduce structure results for $T_0$-reducts of $T$-$\lambda$-spherical completion of models of $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$.
  These in particular entail that whenever $\mathbb{R}_L$ is a reduct of $\mathbb{R}_{an,\exp}$ defining the exponential, every elementary extension of $\mathbb{R}_L$ has an elementary truncation-closed embedding in $\mathbf{No}$. This partially answers a question in [3](arXiv:2002.07739).
  The main technical result is that certain expansion of Hahn fields by generalized power series interpreted as functions defined on the positive infinitesimal elements, have the property that truncation closed subsets generate truncation closed substructures. This leaves room for possible generalizations to the case in which $T_0$ is power bounded but not necessarily a reduct of $T_{an}$.</description>

      <title>Locally tabular products of modal logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the product $L_1\times L_2$ of two Kripke complete consistent logics, local tabularity of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is necessary for local tabularity of $L_1\times L_2$. However, it is not sufficient: the product of two locally tabular logics can be not locally tabular. We provide extra semantic and axiomatic conditions which give criteria of local tabularity of the product of two locally tabular logics. Then we apply them to identify new families of locally tabular products.</description>

      <title>Weakly o-minimal types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study weak o-minimality in the context of complete types in an arbitrary first-order theory. A type $p\in S(A)$ is weakly o-minimal if for some relatively $A$-definable linear order, $&lt;$, on $p(\mathfrak{C})$ every relatively $L_{\mathfrak{C}}$-definable subset of $p(\mathfrak{C})$ has finitely many convex components in $(p(\mathfrak{C}),&lt;)$. We establish many nice properties of weakly o-minimal types. For example, we prove that weakly o-minimal types are dp-minimal and share several properties of weight-one types in stable theories, and that a version of monotonicity theorem holds for relatively definable functions on the locus of a weakly o-minimal type.</description>

      <title>Isotypic equivalence of Abelian p-groups with separable reduced parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that two Abelian $p$-groups with separable reduced parts are isotypically equivalent if and only if their divisible parts and their basic subgroups are elementarily equivalent. Also as a corollary we prove that any Abelian $p$-group with a separable reduced part is $\omega$-strongly homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations I: Directed complete posets and Scott's $D_\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop domain theory in constructive and predicative univalent foundations (also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations II: Continuous and algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>
