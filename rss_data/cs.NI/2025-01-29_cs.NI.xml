      <title>dApps: Enabling Real-Time AI-Based Open RAN Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (RANs) leverage disaggregated and programmable RAN functions and open interfaces to enable closed-loop, data-driven radio resource management. This is performed through custom intelligent applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), optimizing RAN policy scheduling, network slicing, user session management, and medium access control, among others. In this context, we have proposed dApps as a key extension of the O-RAN architecture into the real-time and user-plane domains. Deployed directly on RAN nodes, dApps access data otherwise unavailable to RICs due to privacy or timing constraints, enabling the execution of control actions within shorter time intervals. In this paper, we propose for the first time a reference architecture for dApps, defining their life cycle from deployment by the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to real-time control loop interactions with the RAN nodes where they are hosted. We introduce a new dApp interface, E3, along with an Application Protocol (AP) that supports structured message exchanges and extensible communication for various service models. By bridging E3 with the existing O-RAN E2 interface, we enable dApps, xApps, and rApps to coexist and coordinate. These applications can then collaborate on complex use cases and employ hierarchical control to resolve shared resource conflicts. Finally, we present and open-source a dApp framework based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). We benchmark its performance in two real-time control use cases, i.e., spectrum sharing and positioning in a 5th generation (5G) Next Generation Node Base (gNB) scenario. Our experimental results show that standardized real-time control loops via dApps are feasible, achieving average control latency below 450 microseconds and allowing optimal use of shared spectral resources.</description>

      <title>Distilling Large Language Models for Network Active Queue Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.</description>

      <title>Consumer-Oriented Computing: A Path to Community Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large-scale datacenters are known for its engineering complexity, cooling and oversubscription challenges. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes implementation of community datacenters that are closer to consumers as part of datacenter ecosystem. Having community datacenter can reduce latency, minimize network burden on Internet Service Providers (ISP), use full computing capability, available during disaster events, and simplify the engineering complexity associated with the traditional datacenters. Aside from that, this paper explores one technical design for such community datacenter and business strategy of operating community datacenters.</description>

      <title>Martians Among Us: Observing Private or Reserved IPs on the Public Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoofed traffic has been identified as one of the main issues of concern for network hygiene nowadays, as it facilitates Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by hiding their origin and complicating forensic investigations. Some indicators of poor network hygiene are packets with Bogon or Martian source addresses representing either misconfigurations or spoofed packets. Despite the development of Source Address Validation (SAV) techniques and guidelines such as BCP 38 and BCP 84, Bogons are often overlooked in the filtering practices of network operators. This study uses traceroute measurements from the CAIDA Ark dataset, enriched with historical BGP routing information from RIPE RIS and RouteViews, to investigate the prevalence of Bogon addresses over seven years (2017-2023). Our analysis reveals widespread non-compliance with best practices, with Bogon traffic detected across thousands of ASes. Notably, 82.69%-97.83% of CAIDA Ark vantage points observe paths containing Bogon IPs, primarily RFC1918 addresses. Additionally, 19.70% of all analyzed traceroutes include RFC1918 addresses, while smaller proportions involve RFC6598 (1.50%) and RFC3927 (0.10%) addresses. We identify more than 13,000 unique ASes transiting Bogon traffic, with only 11.64% appearing in more than half of the measurements. Cross-referencing with the Spoofer project and MANRS initiatives shows a concerning gap: 62.67% of ASes that do not filter packets with Bogon sources are marked as non-spoofable, suggesting incomplete SAV implementation. Our contributions include an assessment of network hygiene using the transiting of Bogon packets as a metric, an analysis of the main types of Bogon addresses found in traceroutes, and several proposed recommendations to address the observed gaps, enforcing the need for stronger compliance with best practices to improve global network security.</description>

      <title>Adapting Network Information to Semantics for Generalizable and Plug-and-Play Multi-Scenario Network Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network fault diagnosis is a core challenge in ensuring the stability and reliability of modern network operations. Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Distributed resource allocation in cognitive radio networks with a game learning approach to improve aggregate system capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a game theoretic solution for joint channel allocation and power control in cognitive radio networks analyzed under the physical interference model. The objective is to find a distributed solution that maximizes the network utility, defined with different criteria, with limited information. The problem is addressed through a non-cooperative game based on local information. Although the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium cannot be assured for this game, simulation results show that it exists with high probability and with a performance similar to that of a potential game, where each player requires overall network information. The obtained results are compared with a centralized heuristic genetic algorithm to show the correctness of the proposals. From this point, utility functions for the local game are modified to restrict the transmitted power to drive the solution to a more cooperative approach. To overcome the convergence limitations of the local game, no-regret learning algorithms are used to perform the joint channel and power allocation. These algorithms provide stable mixed strategies in any scenario with even better global performance. This opens an interesting perspective to develop realistic protocols based on the modeled interactions and increases the adaptability to perform efficient opportunistic spectrum access.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of an SDN Controller for Open Optical-circuit-switched Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open optical networks have been considered to be important for cost-effectively building and operating the networks. Recently, the optical-circuit-switches (OCSes) have attracted industry and academia because of their cost efficiency and higher capacity than traditional electrical packet switches (EPSes) and reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs). Though the open interfaces and control planes for traditional ROADMs and transponders have been defined by several standard-defining organizations (SDOs), those of OCSes have not. Considering that several OCSes have already been installed in production datacenter networks (DCNs) and several OCS products are on the market, bringing the openness and interoperability into the OCS-based networks has become important. Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates a software-defined networking (SDN) controller for open optical-circuit-switched networks. To this end, we identified the use cases of OCSes and derived the controller requirements for supporting them. We then proposed a multi-vendor (MV) OCS controller framework that satisfies the derived requirements; it was designed to quickly and consistently operate fiber paths upon receiving the operation requests. We validated our controller by implementing it and evaluating its performance on actual MV-OCS networks. It satisfied all the requirements, and fiber paths could be configured within 1.0 second by using our controller.</description>

      <title>Network Slice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network for Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is transforming transportation systems by extending them into near-ground airspace, offering innovative solutions to mobility challenges. In this space, electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) perform a variety of tasks to improve aviation safety and efficiency, such as collaborative computing and perception. However, eVTOLs face constraints such as compacted shape and restricted onboard computing resources. These limitations necessitate task offloading to nearby high-performance base stations (BSs) for timely processing. Unfortunately, the high mobility of eVTOLs, coupled with their restricted flight airlines and heterogeneous resource management creates significant challenges in dynamic task offloading. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel network slice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network (LAIN) framework for eVTOL tasks. By leveraging advanced network slicing technologies from 5G/6G, the proposed framework dynamically adjusts communication bandwidth, beam alignment, and computing resources to meet fluctuating task demands. Specifically, the framework includes an access pairing method to pre-schedule optimal eVTOL-BS-slice assignments, a pre-assessment algorithm to avoid resource waste, and a deep reinforcement learning-based slice orchestration mechanism to optimize resource allocation and lifecycle management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of resource allocation efficiency and operational/violation costs across varying eVTOL velocities. This work provides valuable insights into intelligent network slicing for future AAM transportation systems.</description>

      <title>ECLYPSE: a Python Framework for Simulation and Emulation of the Cloud-Edge Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cloud-Edge continuum enhances application performance by bringing computation closer to data sources. However, it presents considerable challenges in managing resources and determining service placement, as these tasks require navigating diverse, dynamic environments characterised by fluctuating network conditions. Addressing these challenges calls for tools combining simulation and emulation of Cloud-Edge systems to rigorously assess novel application and resource management strategies. In this paper, we introduce ECLYPSE, a Python-based framework that enables the simulation and emulation of the Cloud-Edge continuum via adaptable resource allocation and service placement models. ECLYPSE features an event-driven architecture for dynamically adapting network configurations and resources. It also supports seamless transitions between simulated and emulated setups. In this work, ECLYPSE capabilities are illustrated over three use cases, showing how the framework supports rapid prototyping across diverse experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Enhancements to P4TG: Performance, Protocols, and Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P4-based traffic generator (P4TG) is a hardware-based traffic generator (TG) running on the Intel Tofino 1 ASIC. The TG can generate up to 1 Tb/s of traffic and directly measures rates, packet loss, and other metrics in the data plane. Many researchers and industrial partners have used it since its publication in 2023 and new features have been requested to be incorporated into P4TG. In this work, we provide an overview of the recently added features of P4TG. These enhancements include new traffic generation capabilities including IPv6 and segment routing v6 (SRv6) support and various encapsulation protocols such as VLAN, QinQ, VxLAN, and MPLS. Further, P4TG is ported to the Intel Tofino 2 platform enabling a generation capability of up to 4 Tb/s. The enhancements to P4TG also provide an improved user experience facilitating automated testing based on RFC 2544, report generation, and visualization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.04617v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main service provided by the coming Quantum Internet will be creating entanglement between any two quantum nodes. We discuss and classify attacks on quantum repeaters, which will serve roles similar to those of classical Internet routers. We have modeled the components for and structure of quantum repeater network nodes. With this model, we point out attack vectors, then analyze attacks in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. While we are reassured about the promises of quantum networks from the confidentiality point of view, integrity and availability present new vulnerabilities not present in classical networks and require care to handle properly. We observe that the requirements on the classical computing/networking elements affect the systems' overall security risks. This component-based analysis establishes a framework for further investigation of network-wide vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-Channel Interference (CCI) is a fundamental problem in wireless communication networks. It is a well-studied problem in the field. As channels use the same frequency, interference in the radio waves occurs which, in turn, reduces the capacity of the interfered channels. There is a need to use the least number of frequencies as communication networks advance to 5G. In this paper, we present a novel technique to manage interference on channels. We use time division for links of the same frequency and, as a result, we show a significant reduction in the number of frequencies used overall in the network.</description>

      <title>Embracing Reconfigurable Antennas in the Tri-hybrid MIMO Architecture for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing system power consumption to rise as a result. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adding new layer for signal processing. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We also discuss several design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.</description>

      <title>Bridging Neural Networks and Wireless Systems with MIMO-OFDM Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications aim to enhance transmission efficiency by jointly optimizing source coding, channel coding, and modulation. While prior research has demonstrated promising performance in simulations, real-world implementations often face significant challenges, including noise variability and nonlinear distortions, leading to performance gaps. This article investigates these challenges in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based semantic communication system, focusing on the practical impacts of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) variations. Our analysis identifies frequency selectivity of the actual channel as a critical factor in performance degradation and demonstrates that targeted mitigation strategies can enable semantic systems to approach theoretical performance. By addressing key limitations in existing designs, we provide actionable insights for advancing semantic communications in practical wireless environments. This work establishes a foundation for bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world deployment, highlighting essential considerations for system design and optimization.</description>

      <title>RG-Attn: Radian Glue Attention for Multi-modality Multi-agent Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception offers an optimal solution to overcome the perception limitations of single-agent systems by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for data sharing and fusion across multiple agents. However, most existing approaches focus on single-modality data exchange, limiting the potential of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion across agents. This overlooks the opportunity to utilize multi-modality data per agent, restricting the system's performance. In the automotive industry, manufacturers adopt diverse sensor configurations, resulting in heterogeneous combinations of sensor modalities across agents. To harness the potential of every possible data source for optimal performance, we design a robust LiDAR and camera cross-modality fusion module, Radian-Glue-Attention (RG-Attn), applicable to both intra-agent cross-modality fusion and inter-agent cross-modality fusion scenarios, owing to the convenient coordinate conversion by transformation matrix and the unified sampling/inversion mechanism. We also propose two different architectures, named Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP) and Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), for conducting cooperative perception. PTP aims for maximum precision performance and achieves smaller data packet size by limiting cross-agent fusion to a single instance, but requiring all participants to be equipped with LiDAR. In contrast, CoS-CoCo supports agents with any configuration-LiDAR-only, camera-only, or LiDAR-camera-both, presenting more generalization ability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both real and simulated cooperative perception datasets. The code will be released at GitHub in early 2025.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Capacity of Byzantine Symmetric Private Information Retrieval and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the asymptotic capacity of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with $B$ Byzantine servers. Prior to finding the capacity, a definition for the Byzantine servers is needed since in the literature there are two different definitions. In \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where it was first defined, the Byzantine servers can send any symbol from the storage, their received queries and some independent random symbols. In \cite{unresponsive_byzantine_1}, Byzantine servers send any random symbol independently of their storage and queries. It is clear that these definitions are not identical, especially when \emph{symmetric} privacy is required. To that end, we define Byzantine servers, inspired by \cite{byzantine_tpir}, as the servers that can share everything, before and after the scheme initiation. In this setting, we find an upper bound, for an infinite number of messages case, that should be satisfied for all schemes that protect against this setting and develop a scheme that achieves this upper bound. Hence, we identify the capacity of the problem.</description>

      <title>PCAP-Backdoor: Backdoor Poisoning Generator for Network Traffic in CPS/IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of connected devices has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. To address these threats, deep learning-based, data-driven intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting and mitigating such attacks. These IDSs analyze network traffic to identify unusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential security breaches. However, prior research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject triggers into the model to manipulate its behavior and cause misclassifications of network traffic. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of deep learning-based IDS systems to backdoor attacks in the context of network traffic analysis. We introduce \texttt{PCAP-Backdoor}, a novel technique that facilitates backdoor poisoning attacks on PCAP datasets. Our experiments on real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic datasets demonstrate that attackers can effectively backdoor a model by poisoning as little as 1\% or less of the entire training dataset. Moreover, we show that an attacker can introduce a trigger into benign traffic during model training yet cause the backdoored model to misclassify malicious traffic when the trigger is present. Finally, we highlight the difficulty of detecting this trigger-based backdoor, even when using existing backdoor defense techniques.</description>
