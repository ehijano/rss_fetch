      <title>The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a future CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band, by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. The project is in the framework of the Italian Space Agency Alcor Program, which aims to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP is approved for a Phase B study that will last for 12 months, starting in mid-2024. We report on the current status of the CUSP mission project as the outcome of the Phase A.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the general-relativistic definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) based on the IAU 2000 resolutions that provide a framework of relativistic reference systems. From this foundation, we derive a transformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG). This equation serves as the cornerstone for constructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of an atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth. The algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth and Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal perturbations caused by the Sun. Our approach provides exquisite details of the TCL--TCG transformation, accurate to a precision of 1 nanosecond. To validate our methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the formalism of local inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their equivalence.</description>

      <title>Abundance, Sizes, and Major Element Compositions of Components in CR and LL Chondrites: Formation from Single Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abundances, apparent sizes, and individual chemical compositions of chondrules, refractory inclusions, other objects and surrounding matrix have been determined for Semarkona (LL3.00) and Renazzo (CR2) using consistent methods and criteria on x-ray element intensity maps. These represent the non-carbonaceous (NC, Semarkona) and carbonaceous chondrite (CC, Renazzo) superclans of chondrite types. We compare object and matrix abundances with similar data for CM, CO, K, and CV chondrites. We assess, pixel-by-pixel, the major element abundance in each object and in the entire matrix. We determine the abundance of "metallic chondrules" in LL chondrites. Chondrules with high Mg/Si and low Fe/Si and matrix carrying opposing ratios complement each other to make whole rocks with near-solar major element ratios in Renazzo. Similar Mg/Si and Fe/Si chondrule-matrix relationships are seen in Semarkona, which is within 11% of solar Mg/Si but significantly Fe-depleted. These results provide a robust constraint in support of single-reservoir models for chondrule formation and accretion, ruling out whole classes of astrophysical models and constraining processes of chondrite component formation and accretion into chondrite parent bodies.</description>

      <title>Preparing for Heliopolarimetry using New-generation Ground-based Radio Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale ejections of magnetized plasma from the Sun and are associated with the most extreme space weather events. The geoeffectiveness of a CME is primarily determined by the southward component of its magnetic fields (CME-$B_z$). Recent studies have shown that CMEs evolve significantly in the inner heliosphere ($\sim20-90\ R_\odot$), and relying on extrapolations from low coronal heights can lead to wrong predictions of CME-$B_z$ in the vicinity of Earth. Hence, it is important to measure CME magnetic fields at these heights to improve CME-$B_z$ prediction. A promising method to measure the CME-entrained magnetic field in the inner heliosphere is by measuring the changes in Faraday rotation (FR) of linearly polarized emission from background radio sources as their line-of-sight crosses the CME plasma. Here, we present the current preparation of new-generation ground-based radio telescopes for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized (low-beta) plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>Hard X-rays from the deep solar atmosphere: An unusual UV burst with flare properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellermann bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Radio-follow-up Observations for Detection of the Magnetic Radio Emission of Extra-Solar Planets: A New Window to Detect Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets, such as transit, radial velocity, astrometry, and the conventional gravitational microlensing approach. These methods rely on observing the effects of exoplanets on the emission or motion of observed stars. All these techniques have focused on the optical or infrared domains. However, an alternative method for exoplanet detection via microlensing events involves planets orbiting the source star, creating a binary source system. In this study, we explore a novel approach to detecting and studying exoplanets exclusively through their radio emissions resulting from magnetospheric processes. We propose utilizing the Roman telescope as a survey observer to detect microlensing events. Subsequently, we investigate the potential for detecting planetary radio signals through follow-up observations of these microlensing events in the radio band using the SKA telescope. This method is viable due to the comparable radio emission levels of exoplanets and their parent stars, unlike optical and infrared emissions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to replicate the observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope, followed by a follow-up observation in radio frequencies using the SKA telescope. We determine that approximately 1317 exoplanets exhibit detectable signals by the SKA telescope during the 7-season observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope. This result indicates that such a method cannot only facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets but also enable the measurement of their magnetic field strength through analysis of their radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>

      <title>Spaceborne COTS-Capsule Hodoscope: Detecting and Characterizing Particle Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COTS-Capsule Spaceborne hodoscope was launched into low earth orbit aboard the International Space Station and operated during 2021-2022. The primary objectives of the payload are: measuring and characterizing the radiation environment within the space station; serving as a technology demonstrator for the COTS-Capsule radiation mitigation apparatus; and testing the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles in space with our detectors. The payload features a particle hodoscope equipped with an array of novel detectors based on polyvinyl toluene scintillators and silicon photomultiplier sensors that are used for radiation detection and characterization. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the construction, preflight performance, testing, qualification, and in-orbit calibration of the COTS-Capsule payload. The hodoscope, sensitive to ionizing cosmic particles, facilitates impinging particle track reconstruction, energy deposition estimation, and linear energy transfer estimation. In specific instances, it also provides particle identification and energy deposition estimation.</description>
