      <title>A forward-modelling approach to overcome PSF smearing and fit flexible models to the chemical structure of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, metallicity profiles of galaxies have been modelled using a radially symmetric, two-parameter linear model, which reveals that most galaxies are more metal-rich in their central regions than their outskirts. However, this model is known to yield inaccurate results when the point-spread function (PSF) of a telescope is large. Furthermore, a radially symmetric model cannot capture asymmetric structures within a galaxy. In this work, we present an extension of the popular forward-modelling python package LENSTRONOMY, which allows the user to overcome both of these obstacles. We demonstrate the new features of this code base through two illustrative examples on simulated data. First, we show that through forward modelling, LENSTRONOMY is able to recover accurately the metallicity gradients of galaxies, even when the PSF is comparable to the size of a galaxy, as long as the data is observed with a sufficient number of pixels. Additionally, we demonstrate how LENSTRONOMY is able to fit irregular metallicity profiles to galaxies that are not well-described by a simple surface brightness profile. This opens up pathways for detailed investigations into the connections between morphology and chemical structure for galaxies at cosmological distances using the transformative capabilities of JWST. Our code is publicly available and open source, and can also be used to model spatial distributions of other galaxy properties that are traced by its surface brightness profile.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES -- XII. Time-delay Measurements of Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernovae using a Long Short-Term Memory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are a promising probe to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) directly. To use LSNe Ia for cosmography, a time-delay measurement between the multiple images, a lens-mass model, and a mass reconstruction along the line of sight are required. In this work, we present the machine learning network LSTM-FCNN which is a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and a fully-connected neural network (FCNN). The LSTM-FCNN is designed to measure time delays on a sample of LSNe Ia spanning a broad range of properties, which we expect to find with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and for which follow-up observations are planned. With follow-up observations in $i$ band (cadence of one to three days with a single-epoch $5\sigma$ depth of 24.5 mag), we reach a bias-free delay measurement with a precision around 0.7 days over a large sample of LSNe Ia. The LSTM-FCNN is far more general than previous machine learning approaches such as the Random Forest (RF), where a RF has to be trained for each observational pattern separately, and yet the LSTM-FCNN outperforms the RF by a factor of roughly three. Therefore, the LSTM-FCNN is a very promising approach to achieve robust time delays in LSNe Ia, which is important for a precise and accurate constraint on $H_0$</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Case Study in the Misidentification of Starlink Satellites as UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the most ancient branch of astronomy, astrometry has been developed for thousands of years. However, it has only recently become possible to utilize astrometry for the detection of exoplanets. Gaia, an astrometric surveyor of 1 billion stars, is capable of measuring the position of stars with a precision as high as 20 $\mu$as. Gaia is expected to discover more than 10,000 exoplanets by the end of its mission, surpassing the productivity of most exoplanet surveys.
  In this chapter, I will introduce different techniques used to achieve high-precision astrometry. Subsequently, I will explore how both relative and absolute astrometry can be employed to detect exoplanets. Finally, I will present the detection limit of the Gaia astrometric survey.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation of Solar Radio Spikes at Low Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar radio spikes are short lived, narrow bandwidth features in low frequency solar radio observations. The timing of their occurrence and the number of spikes in a given observation is often unpredictable. The high temporal and frequency of resolution of modern radio telescopes such as NenuFAR mean that manually identifying radio spikes is an arduous task. Machine learning approaches to data exploration in solar radio data is on the rise. Here we describe a convolutional neural network to identify the per pixel location of radio spikes as well as determine some simple characteristics of duration, spectral width and drift rate. The model, which we call SpikeNet, was trained using an Nvidia Tesla T4 16GB GPU with ~100000 sample spikes in a total time of 2.2 hours. The segmentation performs well with an intersection over union in the test set of ~0.85. The root mean squared error for predicted spike properties is of the order of 23%. Applying the algorithm to unlabelled data successfully generates segmentation masks although the accuracy of the predicted properties is less reliable, particularly when more than one spike is present in the same 64 X 64 pixel time-frequency range. We have successfully demonstrated that our convolutional neural network can locate and characterise solar radio spikes in a number of seconds compared to the weeks it would take for manual identification.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Taiji to detect a gravitational-wave background from cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations have presented compelling evidence for a stochastic signal at nanohertz frequencies, potentially originating from cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are linear topological defects that can arise during phase transitions in the early Universe or as fundamental strings in superstring theory. This paper focuses on investigating the detection capabilities of Taiji, a planned space-based gravitational wave detector, for the gravitational wave background generated by cosmic strings. By analyzing simulated Taiji data and utilizing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques, we demonstrate a significant improvement in precision compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data, surpassing it by an order of magnitude. This highlights the enhanced measurement capabilities of Taiji. Consequently, Taiji can serve as a valuable complementary tool to pulsar timing arrays in validating and exploring the physics of cosmic strings in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Optical system for extremely large spectroscopic survey telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents research work on a spectroscopic survey telescope. Our idea is as follows: for such a telescope, a pure reflecting optical system is designed, which should have an aperture and a field of view (FOV) both as large as possible and excellent image quality, and then a strip lensm (lens-prism) atmospheric dispersion corrector (S-ADC) is added, only for correcting the atmospheric dispersion. Given the fund limitation and the simplicity of scaling up, some 12-m telescopes are designed as examples. Su, Korsch, and Meinel put forward the four-mirror Nasmyth systems I and II, which are used in this paper. FOVs of 1.5{\deg}, 2{\deg}, and 2.5{\deg} are selected. For all systems, the image qualities are excellent. Because the S-ADC relaxes the optical glass size restriction, this 12-m telescope with a FOV of 2.5{\deg} can be magnified in proportion to a 16-m telescope. Its etendue (from French \'etendue) and focal surface will now be the largest in the world. In such a telescope, a pure reflecting optical system can also be obtained. A subsequent coud\'e system is designed with excellent image quality.</description>

      <title>The R2D2 deep neural network series paradigm for fast precision imaging in radio astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-interferometric (RI) imaging entails solving high-resolution high-dynamic range inverse problems from large data volumes. Recent image reconstruction techniques grounded in optimization theory have demonstrated remarkable capability for imaging precision, well beyond CLEAN's capability. These range from advanced proximal algorithms propelled by handcrafted regularization operators, such as the SARA family, to hybrid plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms propelled by learned regularization denoisers, such as AIRI. Optimization and PnP structures are however highly iterative, which hinders their ability to handle the extreme data sizes expected from future instruments. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a novel deep learning approach, dubbed ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging''. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. It thus takes a hybrid structure between a PnP algorithm and a learned version of the matching pursuit algorithm that underpins CLEAN. We present a comprehensive study of our approach, featuring its multiple incarnations distinguished by their DNN architectures. We provide a detailed description of its training process, targeting a telescope-specific approach. R2D2's capability to deliver high precision is demonstrated in simulation, across a variety of image and observation settings using the Very Large Array (VLA). Its reconstruction speed is also demonstrated: with only few iterations required to clean data residuals at dynamic ranges up to 100000, R2D2 opens the door to fast precision imaging. R2D2 codes are available in the BASPLib library on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning recovery of foreground wedge-removed 21-cm light cones for high-$z$ galaxy mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming experiments will map the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal over three-dimensional volumes of space during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Several methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue of astrophysical foreground contamination in tomographic images of the 21-cm signal, one of which involves the excision of a wedge-shaped region in cylindrical Fourier space. While this removes the $k$-modes most readily contaminated by foregrounds, the concurrent removal of cosmological information located within the wedge considerably distorts the structure of 21-cm images. In this study, we build upon a U-Net based deep learning algorithm to reconstruct foreground wedge-removed maps of the 21-cm signal, newly incorporating light-cone effects. Adopting the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) as our fiducial instrument, we highlight that our U-Net recovery framework retains a reasonable level of reliability even in the face of instrumental limitations and noise. We subsequently evaluate the efficacy of recovered maps in guiding high-redshift galaxy searches and providing context to existing galaxy catalogues. This will allow for studies of how the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function varies across environments, and ultimately refine our understanding of the connection between the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies during the EoR.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE: Resolving the End of Star Formation and Structure of AGN Accretion Disks from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently become possible to zoom-in from cosmological to sub-pc scales in galaxy simulations to follow accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes. This allows us to span scales from ~100 Mpc down to &lt;100 au (~300 Schwarzschild radii) around a SMBH at a time where it accretes as a bright quasar, in a single simulation. We show that accretion rates up to $\sim 10-100\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ can be sustained into the accretion disk at $\ll 10^{3}\,R_{\rm schw}$, with gravitational torques between stars and gas dominating on sub-kpc scales until star formation is shut down on sub-pc scales by a combination of optical depth to cooling and strong magnetic fields. There is an intermediate-scale, flux-frozen disk which is gravitoturbulent and stabilized by magnetic pressure sustaining strong turbulence and inflow with persistent spiral modes. In this paper we focus on how gas gets into the small-scale disk, and how star formation is efficiently suppressed.</description>

      <title>A 4-8 GHz Kinetic Inductance Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifier Using Four-Wave Mixing with Near Quantum-Limit Noise Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPA) have a wide instantaneous bandwidth with near quantum-limited sensitivity and a relatively high dynamic range. Because of this, they are suitable readout devices for cryogenic detectors and superconducting qubits and have a variety of applications in quantum sensing. This work discusses the design, fabrication, and performance of a KI-TWPA based on four-wave mixing in a NbTiN microstrip transmission line. This device amplifies a signal band from 4 to 8~GHz without contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an amplifier-added noise of $ 0.5 \leq N_{added} \leq 1.5$ photons from 4.5 - 8 GHz.</description>
