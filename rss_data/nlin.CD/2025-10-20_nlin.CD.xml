      <title>Globalizing the Carleman linear embedding method for nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carleman embedding method is a widely used technique for linearizing a system of nonlinear differential equations, but fails to converge in regions where there are multiple fixed points. We propose and test three different versions of a global piecewise Carleman embedding technique, based on partitioning space into multiple regions where the center and size of the embedding region are chosen to control convergence. The first method switches between local linearization regions of fixed size once the trajectory reaches the boundary of the current linearization chart. During the transition, the embedding is reconstructed within the newly created chart, centered at the transition point. The second method also adapts the chart size dynamically, enhancing accuracy in regions where multiple fixed points are located. The third method partitions the state space using a static grid with precomputed linearization charts of fixed size, making it more suitable for applications that require high speed. All techniques are numerically tested on multiple integrable and chaotic nonlinear dynamical systems demonstrating their applicability for problems that are completely intractable for the standard Carleman embedding method. Simulations of chaotic dynamical systems such as various types of strange attractors demonstrate the power of the adaptive methods, if a sufficiently low tolerance is imposed. Still, the non-adaptive version of the method, with fixed centers and sizes of the linearization charts, can be faster in simulating dynamical systems while providing similar accuracy and may be more appropriate as the basis of algorithms for future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of inner and outer motions in near-wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the causality of near-wall inner and outer turbulent motions. The inner motions are defined as the self-sustained near-wall cycle, and the outer motions as those living in the logarithmic layer exhibiting footprints on the near-wall region. Causal inference with three typical methods is performed, i.e. transfer entropy, information flow, and SURD (synergistic--unique--redundant decomposition of causality). The causal inference methods are first applied to several canonical problems to illustrate their abilities and differences, including a linear problem, a non-linear problem, and a low-dimensional model of near-wall turbulence. It is demonstrated that all three methods can produce consistent causal findings. Furthermore, we study the causalities between the inner and outer turbulent motions in a channel flow using the three methods with an improved inner-outer decomposition method. It is revealed that both the inner and outer motions are self-sustained and independent of each other, supporting the self-sustaining mechanism of turbulent motions at all scales. We also find that there are top-down and bottom-up influences in the outer motions and their near-wall footprints, challenging the traditional sole top-down view. More interestingly, pressure is identified to play an active role in the inner-outer causalities and may act as a bridge in linking the inner and outer turbulent motions.</description>
