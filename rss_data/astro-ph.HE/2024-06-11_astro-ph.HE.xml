      <title>Cosmic Censorship in Sgr A* and M87*: Observationally Excluding Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaging of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87*) by the Event Horizon Telescope constrains the location and nature of emission from these objects. Coupled with flux limits from the near-infrared through the ultraviolet, the attendant size constraints provide strong evidence for the absence of an accretion-powered photosphere, and therefore for the existence of an event horizon about an astrophysical black hole. Here, we demonstrate that a broad class of naked singularities are also generically excluded, regardless of the nature and unknown physical impact of singularity itself, subject to a single weak assumption about locality. While we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we are nevertheless able to exclude a large number of commonly invoked naked singularity spacetimes in this way.</description>

      <title>I-band photometry of the quiescent black hole X-ray nova GROJ0422+32=V518 Per: modelling of the orbital light curve and estimation of the black hole mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new photometric observations of the X-ray nova GROJ0422+32 (V518 Per) carried out in the I$_c$ band over 14 nights in 2020 -- 2023. We had to revise the orbital period of the system, the new value $P_{\rm orb}=5^{\rm h}04^{\rm m}35.50^{\rm s} \pm 0.04^{\rm s}$ is about one minute shorter than the period by Webb et al. (2000) but close to the result reported earlier by Filippenko et al. (1995). The obtained folded light curve has a regular shape with a clear ellipticity effect and signatures of a slight heating effect. The simulations of this light curve in terms of the model of an interacting binary system allowed us to estimate the orbital inclination $i = 33^\circ - 49^\circ$ of the system and derive masses of the black hole $M_x=(6.5\pm2.9)M_\odot$ and companion star $M_v=(0.47\pm0.21)M_\odot$. This range of the black hole masses overlaps with the known gap of (2--5)\,M$_\odot$ in the distribution of compact objects masses but mostly it lies above the upper boundary of this gap. To obtain more precise estimates one needs to know the degree of heating of the donor star, so synchronous X-ray/optical observations of this system are desirable.</description>

      <title>X-ray Afterglow limits on the viewing angles of short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed behavior of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) afterglow lightcurve can reveal the angular structure of the relativistic jet and constrain the observer's viewing angle $\theta_\textrm{obs}$. Regardless of viewing angle, the afterglow emission is produced by the interaction between the relativistic jet and its surrounding environment. However, the observed deceleration time of the jet, and, therefore, the time of the afterglow peak, depends on the observer's viewing angle. A larger viewing angle leads to a later peak of the afterglow and a lower flux at peak. We use the the earliest X-ray afterglow detections of 58 cosmological sGRBs detected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope to set an upper limit on the ratio of the viewing angle $\theta_\textrm{obs}$ to the jet's half-opening angle $\theta_\textrm{c}$. We adopt a power-law angular jet structure in both energy $E(\theta)\propto\theta^{-a}$ and Lorentz factor $\Gamma(\theta)\propto\theta^{-b}$ beyond the core. For this structured jet scenario we find that either sGRBs are viewed within $\theta_\textrm{obs}/\theta_\textrm{c}&lt;1$ or the initial Lorentz factor of material in their jet's core is extremely high ($\Gamma_0&gt;500$). If we consider a tophat jet structure, we constrain 90% of our sample to be viewed within $\theta_\textrm{obs}/\theta_\textrm{c}&lt;1.06$ and 1.15 for our canonical and conservative afterglow scenarios. For a subset of events with measurements of the jet break, under the assumption that they on-axis we can constrain $\Gamma_0\theta_\textrm{c}\gtrsim 30$. This confirmation that cosmological sGRBs are viewed either on-axis or very close to their jet's core has significant implications for the nature of the prompt gamma-ray production mechanism and for the rate of future sGRB detections coincident with gravitational waves (GWs), implying that they are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Broadening Of The SPOL Spectropolarimeter At The University Of Arizona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ground-based Observational Support of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is conducted by the University of Arizona using the 2.3m Bok and 1.54m Kuiper telescopes operated by the Steward Observatory (SO). This program monitors blazar sources with spectroscopic (among others) observations. Yet, the instrumental broadenings for the different slit widths used in the spectra, are unavailable (the widths range from 2.0 to 12.7 arcsec). Using quasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations of the blazar 3C 273 between the SO, Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo Haro (OAGH), and Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir (OAN-SPM), we can provide an estimation of the instrumental profile for two of the slit widths. Since the instrumental broadening and the slit width are directly proportional, we were able to estimate the instrumental broadening for all six slit widths used at the SO. We found significant variations between the instrumental profiles, emphasizing the need to correct the instrumental broadening for each aperture.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fermi Gamma-Ray Bursts Based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are typically classified into long and short GRBs based on their durations. However, there is a significant overlapping in the duration distributions of these two categories. In this paper, we apply the unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called t-SNE and UMAP to classify 2061 Fermi GRBs based on four observed quantities: duration, peak energy, fluence, and peak flux. The map results of t-SNE and UMAP show a clear division of these GRBs into two clusters. We mark the two clusters as GRBs-I and GRBs-II, and find that all GRBs associated with supernovae are classified as GRBs-II. It includes the peculiar short GRB 200826A, which was confirmed to originate from the death of a massive star. Furthermore, except for two extreme events GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, all GRBs associated with kilonovae fall into GRBs-I population. By comparing to the traditional classification of short and long GRBs, the distribution of durations for GRBs-I and GRBs-II do not have a fixed boundary. We find that more than 10% of GRBs-I have a duration greater than 2 seconds, while approximately 1% of GRBs-II have a duration shorter than 2 seconds.</description>

      <title>Optical and HI observations of IC 443 and G189.6+3.3 in a complex environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 is one of the best-studied Galactic SNRs at many wavelengths. It is interacting with a very complex environment, including the SNR G189.6+3.3 and HII regions. In this paper, we observed IC 443 and G189.6+3.3 using the 1.5- and 1-m telescopes to better understand the nature of these SNRs in the optical band. We perform H_alpha images showing both filamentary and diffuse structures, and long-slit spectra from many locations with Balmer and forbidden lines detected for IC 443 and G189.6+3.3. The [SII]/ H_alpha ratios confirm the SNR nature of G189.6+3.3. The ranges of our estimated electron density and pre-shock cloud density clearly indicate the complex structure surrounding IC 443 and G189.6+3.3. We also investigated the archival HI data and newly found some shell-like distributions of HI that are possibly associated with G189.6+3.3.</description>

      <title>The quantum-refractive evolution of polarization states in pulsar emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states under the quantum refraction effects combined with the frequency dependence of pulsar emission; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviours. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Generational Black Hole Population Analysis with an Astrophysically Informed Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the population statistics of black holes in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog using a parametric mass function derived from simulations of massive stars experiencing pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN). Our formalism enables us to separate the black hole mass function into sub-populations corresponding to mergers between objects formed via different astrophysical pathways, allowing us to infer the properties of black holes formed from stellar collapse and black holes formed via prior mergers separately. Applying this formalism, we find that this model fits the data better than the powerlaw+peak model with Bayes factor $ 9.7\pm0.1$. We measure the location of the lower edge of the upper black hole mass gap to be $M_{\rm BHMG}=84.05_{-12.88}^{+17.19}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, providing evidence that the $35{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Gaussian peak detected in the data using other models is not associated with the PPISN pile-up predicted to precede this gap. Incorporating spin, we find that the normalized spins of stellar remnant black holes are close to zero while those of higher generation black holes tend to larger values. All of these results are in accordance with the predictions of stellar structure theory and black hole merger scenarios. Finally, we combine our mass function with the spectral siren method for measuring the Hubble constant to find $H_0=36.19_{-10.91}^{17.50}$ km/s/Mpc and discuss potential explanations of this low value. Our results demonstrate how astrophysically-informed mass functions can facilitate the interpretation of gravitational wave catalog data to provide information about black hole formation and cosmology. Future data releases will improve the precision of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Inference of the Mass Composition of Cosmic Rays with energies from $\mathbf{10^{18.5}}$ to $\mathbf{10^{20}}$ eV using the Pierre Auger Observatory and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$, inferred for the first time on an event-by-event level using the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using deep learning, we were able to extend measurements of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions up to energies of 100 EeV ($10^{20}$ eV), not yet revealed by current measurements, providing new insights into the mass composition of cosmic rays at extreme energies. Gaining a 10-fold increase in statistics compared to the Fluorescence Detector data, we find evidence that the rate of change of the average $X_\mathrm{max}$ with the logarithm of energy features three breaks at $6.5\pm0.6~(\mathrm{stat})\pm1~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, $11\pm 2~(\mathrm{stat})\pm1~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, and $31\pm5~(\mathrm{stat})\pm3~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, in the vicinity to the three prominent features (ankle, instep, suppression) of the cosmic-ray flux. The energy evolution of the mean and standard deviation of the measured $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions indicates that the mass composition becomes increasingly heavier and purer, thus being incompatible with a large fraction of light nuclei between 50 EeV and 100 EeV.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Depth of Maximum of Air-Shower Profiles with energies between $\mathbf{10^{18.5}}$ and $\mathbf{10^{20}}$ eV using the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an investigation of the mass composition of cosmic rays with energies from 3 to 100 EeV (1 EeV=$10^{18}$ eV) using the distributions of the depth of shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$. The analysis relies on ${\sim}50,000$ events recorded by the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory and a deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm. Above energies of 5 EeV, the data set offers a 10-fold increase in statistics with respect to fluorescence measurements at the Observatory. After cross-calibration using the Fluorescence Detector, this enables the first measurement of the evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions up to 100 EeV. Our findings are threefold:
  (1.) The evolution of the mean logarithmic mass towards a heavier composition with increasing energy can be confirmed and is extended to 100 EeV.
  (2.) The evolution of the fluctuations of $X_\mathrm{max}$ towards a heavier and purer composition with increasing energy can be confirmed with high statistics. We report a rather heavy composition and small fluctuations in $X_\mathrm{max}$ at the highest energies.
  (3.) We find indications for a characteristic structure beyond a constant change in the mean logarithmic mass, featuring three breaks that are observed in proximity to the ankle, instep, and suppression features in the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the genealogy of LIGO-Virgo black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes, whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant black holes. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an "injection study" based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically-formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the 'parent' and 'grandparent' binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce black holes. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass-gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. Our results indicate that at least one component of these three observed binaries was formed through a prior binary black hole merger. This approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for three point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for pseudo-Dirac scenario. We find that a common mass-squared-difference $\delta m^2$ for all three flavors can be constrained as $\delta m^2 \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-19}~eV^2$ for the source NGC 1068, $\delta m^2 \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-20}~eV^2$ for the source TXS 0506+056, and $\delta m^2 \lesssim 2.3 \times 10^{-21}~eV^2$ for the source PKS 1424+240 at 90% C.L. A stacking analysis gives a constrain on $\delta m^2 \le 2.3 \times 10^{-21}~eV^2$ at 90% CL which is dominated by the constraint obtained from PKS 1424+240.</description>

      <title>Non-Kerr Constraints using Binary Black Hole inspirals considering phase modifications up to 4 PN order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole (BH) is thought to be described by the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution of the Einstein equation. Signatures of binary black hole (BBH) coalescence in gravitational waves (GW) follow the Kerr spacetime as the theoretical foundation. Hence, any possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime around BHs serve as a test of the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime and of the predictions of General Relativity. In our study, we perform a theory-agnostic test of the Kerr hypothesis using BBH inspirals from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering the Johannsen metric, we compute the leading-order deviation to the emitted GW in the frequency domain. Our results provide constraints on two deformation parameters ($\alpha_{13}$ and $\epsilon_3$) and demonstrate the degeneracy between these two non-Kerr parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine the thermal evolution of the oscillation spectrum of a neutron star with constant redshifted temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of post-merger remnants of binary neutron star mergers in the framework of Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor theory of gravity with a massive scalar field by numerical relativity simulation. It is found that the threshold mass for prompt collapse is raised in the presence of the excited scalar field. Our simulation results also suggest the existence of long-lived $\phi-$mode in hypermassive neutron stars due to the presence of the massive scalar field which enhances the quasi-radial oscillation in the remnant. We investigate the descalarization condition in hypermassive neutron stars and discover a distinctive signature in post-merger gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent accreted crust of neutron stars: The role of proton shell effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of accreting neutron stars are widely used to constrain the microphysical properties of superdense matter. A key ingredient in this analysis is the heating associated with nuclear reactions in the outer layers of the neutron star (crust), as well as the equation of state and composition of these layers. As recently shown, the neutron hydrostatic/diffusion (nHD) condition is valid in the inner part of the crust, where some of the neutrons are not bound to the nuclei, and this condition should be properly incorporated into crustal models. Here we construct models of the accreted crust of a neutron star, taking into account the nHD condition and proton shell effects in nuclei. For numerical illustration, we employ the recently proposed compressible liquid drop model, which incorporates shell effects. However, our approach is general and can also be used in future studies relying on more sophisticated nuclear physics models.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Torsion on Neutron Star Structure in Einstein-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein--Cartan gravity is a close historical sibling of general relativity that allows for spacetime torsion. As a result, angular momentum couples to spacetime geometry in a similar way to energy. While consequences of this are well studied on cosmological scales, their role in neutron star physics is largely under-explored. We study the effects that torsion, sourced by either microphysical spin or macroscopic angular momentum, has on neutron stars. For this, we use a simplified polytropic model to quantify the microphysical coupling to torsion. We also derive expressions to model rotation-induced torsion effects and estimate the consequences for rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates. We find that the presence of torsion in general leads to neutron stars with smaller radii and masses, but higher central densities. Realistic models for microphysical spin lead to torsion effects that have no relevant influence on the neutron star structure. Rotation-induced torsion effects however, can decrease the radius by up to $900\,m$, which is comparable to the increase due to centrifugal forces. Depending on which effect dominates, this leads to a torsion-induced spin-up or spin-down of the neutron star. We conclude that torsion effects due to rotation can not be neglected and are large enough to be tested using current or near-future technology.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the observed alignment of spots in the X-ray films in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles itself together with the transverse momentum conservation is tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. It is shown that the high degree of alignment can appear at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of selected most energetic particles.</description>

Abstract: High-precision cosmic-ray data from ongoing and recent past experiments (Voyager, ACE-CRIS, PAMELA, ATIC, CREAM, NUCLEON, AMS-02, CALET, DAMPE) are being released in the tens of MeV/n to multi-TeV/n energy range. Astrophysical and dark matter interpretations of these data are limited by the precision of nuclear production cross-sections. In Paper I, PRC 98, 034611 (2018), we set up a procedure to rank nuclear reactions whose desired measurements will enable us to fully exploit currently available data on CR Li to N ($Z=3-7$) species. Here we extend these rankings to O up to Si nuclei ($Z=8-14$), also updating our results on the LiBeB species. We also highlight how comprehensive new high precision nuclear data, that could e.g. be obtained at the SPS at CERN, would be a game-changer for the determination of key astrophysical quantities (diffusion coefficient, halo size of the Galaxy) and indirect searches for dark matter signatures.</description>

      <title>Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei: Shocks, jets, impact on the ISM, X- and gamma-rays, neutrinos, fusion ignition and afterglow</title>

Abstract: In galactic nuclei, stellar densities are so high that stars can physically collide with each other. In this work we focus on the collision of red giants and in particular on the formation of non-thermal processes through collisions and their properties. We analytically address these points by evaluating head-on collisions but also take into account scenarios with a deviation from the radial orbit, which we treat in a perturbative fashion. The collisions produce internal shocks with supersonic Mach numbers. Almost immediately, jet-like structures with important Lorentz factors form. The debris from the collision produces another shock wave which, when interacting with the interstellar medium of a galactic nucleus, leads to particle acceleration. We estimate the background flux in X- and gamma rays created by the background of these collisions by deriving the spectral index within a radius of 100 Mpc and find that they are high. Additionally, we make an estimate of the neutrino production and find about $10^{11}$ neutrinos per square meter per second for a collision at 100 Mpc from Earth. Also, we derive that there is a non-negligible chance to ignite fusion during the collision, due to the squeezing of the material. We investigate the possibility that the degenerate cores collide with each other, leading to a high afterglow luminosity, and find that it is non-negligible, although this should be addressed with dedicated numerical simulations. Colliding red giants in galactic nuclei trigger a plethora of high-energy phenomena, and have a particular gravitational wave emission associated, as shown by us, so that their detection will allow us to rule out alternatives.</description>

      <title>Discovering neutron stars with LISA via measurements of orbital eccentricity in Galactic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LISA will detect $\sim \! 10^4$ Galactic binaries, the majority being double white dwarfs. However, approximately $\sim \! 1 \textrm{--} 5 \%$ of these systems will contain neutron stars which, if they can be correctly identified, will provide new opportunities for studying binary evolution pathways involving mass reversal and supernovae as well as being promising targets for multi-messenger observations. Eccentricity, expected from neutron star natal kicks, will be a key identifying signature for binaries containing a neutron star. Eccentric binaries radiate at widely-spaced frequency harmonics that must first be identified as originating from a single source and then analysed coherently. A multi-harmonic heterodyning approach for this type of data analysis is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on a range of simulated eccentric LISA signals. This is used to: (i) investigate LISA's ability to measure orbital eccentricity and to quantify the minimum detectable eccentricity; (ii) demonstrate how eccentricity and periastron precession help to break the mass degeneracy allowing the individual component masses to be inferred, potentially confirming the presence of a neutron star; (iii) investigate the possibility of source misidentification when the individual harmonics of an eccentric binary masquerade as separate circular binaries; and (iv) investigate the possibility of source reclassification, where parameter estimation results of multiple circular analyses are combined in postprocessing to quickly infer the parameters of an eccentric source. The broader implications of this for the ongoing design of the LISA global fit are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-redshift absorption in the Seyfert galaxy PG 1211+143 -- a distant inflow maintaining off-plane accretion or the gravitational redshift of matter orbiting the SMBH?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a high velocity (~ 0.3c) inflow of highly ionized matter during an extended XMM-Newton observation of the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG 1211+143 in 2014 provided the first direct evidence of a short-lived accretion event, and an explanation for the powerful winds (UFOs) now recognised as a common property of many luminous Seyfert galaxies. Although the ultra-fast inflow - observed at a redshift of 0.483 - was detected in only one of seven spacecraft orbits, weaker (lower column) but more persistent absorption is seen - at a redshift of 0.123 - in the high exposure, soft X-ray (RGS) spectra summed over all 7 individual spacecraft orbits. Similar stacking of the higher energy (pn camera) spectra reveals underlying absorption at a redshift of 0.148. Interpreted, conventionally, as a Doppler redshift, the RGS observation indicates a line-of-sight inflow velocity v ~ 0.038c and (free-fall) radial location at 1400 R_g, with the higher redshift and ionization in pn camera spectra perhaps detecting that inflow closer to the black hole. A very different explanation would be absorption in matter subject to the strong gravity close to the SMBH, an interpretation supported by the launch of a new UFO in the final spacecraft orbit.</description>

      <title>Fast neutrino flavor conversions in a supernova: Emergence, evolution, and effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos, which can occur in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are multiangle effects. They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed. Other aspects including the impact of the vacuum term and the coexistence with other type of flavor instabilities are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Finding the Particularity of the Active Episode of SGR J1935+2154 during Which FRB 20200428 Occurred: Implication from Statistics of Fermi/GBM X-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11877v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical (SOC) system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the FRB episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the fast radio burst (FRB) emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfven waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a shock-compressed magnetic field in the north-western rim of the young supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 with X-ray polarimetry</title>

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide insights into cosmic-ray acceleration and magnetic field dynamics at shock fronts. Recent X-ray polarimetric measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) have revealed radial magnetic fields near particle acceleration sites in young SNRs, including Cassiopeia A, Tycho, and SN 1006. We present here the spatially-resolved IXPE X-ray polarimetric observation of the northwestern rim of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. For the first time, our analysis shows that the magnetic field in particle acceleration sites of this SNR is oriented tangentially with respect to the shock front. Because of the lack of precise Faraday-rotation measurements in the radio band, this was not possible before. The average measured polarization degree (PD) of the synchtrotron emission is 12.5 {\pm} 3.3%, lower than the one measured by IXPE in SN 1006, comparable to the Tycho one, but notably higher than the one in Cassiopeia A. On sub-parsec scales, localized patches within RX J1713.7-3946 display PD up to 41.5 {\pm} 9.5%. These results are compatible with a shock-compressed magnetic field. However, in order to explain the observed PD, either the presence of a radial net magnetic field upstream of the shock, or partial reisotropization of the turbulence downstream by radial magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities, can be invoked. From comparison of PD and magnetic field distribution with {\gamma}-rays and 12 CO data, our results provide new inputs in favor of a leptonic origin of the {\gamma}-ray emission.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model for the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; with energy $\gtrsim 10^{18} {\rm~eV}$). In this work, we propose a novel model generating MeV emission lines in GRB, which can constrain the properties of heavy nuclei that potentially exist in GRB jets. Specifically, we find that relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions originating from the $\beta$ decay of unstable nuclei and/or the recombination entrained in the GRB jet can generate narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited-electrons. This model can successfully explain the MeV emission line observed in the most luminous GRB ever recorded, GRB~221009A, with suitable parameters including a Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 820-1700$ and a total mass of heavy nuclei $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^{23} - 10^{26}$~g. Especially, the emission line broadening can be reasonably attributed to both the expansion of the jet shell and the thermal motion of nuclei, naturally resulting in a narrow width ($\sigma_{\rm line} / E_{\rm line} \lesssim 0.2$) consistent with the observation. Furthermore, we predict that different GRBs can exhibit lines in different bands with various evolving behaviors, which might be confirmed with further observations. Finally, our model provides indirect evidence that GRBs may be one of the sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>The JADES Transient Survey: Discovery and Classification of Supernovae in the JADES Deep Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multi-cycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near-infrared images to date (down to $\sim$30.5 ABmag) over $\sim$25 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with one year of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to $z&gt;$2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at $z&lt;$2, 23 at 2$&lt;z&lt;$3, 8 at 3$&lt;z&lt;$4, 7 at 4$&lt;z&lt;$5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is $\sim$1-2 per arcmin$^2$ per year, demonstrating the power of JWST as a supernova discovery machine. We also conducted multi-band follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), light curves, and classifications. Even at $z\geq$2, the NIRCam data quality is such that we can perform multi-epoch light-curve fitting to classify supernovae with a reasonable degree of confidence. The multi-epoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at $z_{spec}= $ 2.91, Type IIP SN at $z_{spec}= $ 3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at $z_{spec}= $ 2.845. We also found that two $z\sim$16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Relativistic Stripped Envelope Type Ic-BL Supernova at z = 2.83 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) and its host galaxy (JADES-GS+53.13533-27.81457) at $z = 2.83$. This SN (named SN 2023adta) was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Program. Follow-up observations with JWST/NIRSpec provided a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 2.83$ and the classification as a SN Ic-BL. The light curve of SN 2023adta matches well with other stripped envelope supernovae and we find a high peak luminosity, $M_V = -19.0 \pm 0.2$ mag, based on the distribution of best-fit SNe. The broad absorption features in its spectrum are consistent with other SNe Ic-BL 1-3 weeks after peak brightness. We measure a Ca II NIR triplet expansion velocity of $29{,}000 \pm 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$. The host galaxy of SN 2023adta is irregular, and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates a metallicity of $Z = 0.35^{+0.16}_{-0.08} Z_{\odot}$. This environment is consistent with the population of low-$z$ SNe Ic-BL which prefer lower metallicities relative to other stripped envelope supernovae, and track long duration $\gamma$-ray burst (LGRB) environments. We do not identify any GRBs that are coincident with SN 2023adta. Given the rarity of SNe Ic-BL in the local universe, the detection of a SN Ic-BL at $z = 2.83$ could indicate that their rates are enhanced at high redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear character of general relativity leaves its imprint in the coalescence of two black holes, from the inspiral to the final ringdown stage. To quantify the impact of nonlinearities, we work at second order in black hole perturbation theory and we study the excitation of second-order modes relative to the first-order modes that drive them as we vary the black hole spin and the initial data for the perturbations. The relative amplitude of second-order modes is only mildly dependent on the initial data that we consider, but it strongly decreases for large black hole spins. This implies that the extrapolation of calculations based on the Kerr-CFT correspondence to subextremal Kerr black holes should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>Evolution of X-ray galaxy Cluster Properties in a Representative Sample (EXCPReS). Optimal binning for temperature profile extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present XMM-Newton observations of a representative X-ray selected sample of 31 galaxy clusters at moderate redshift $(0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6)$, spanning the mass range $10^{14} &lt; M_{\textrm 500} &lt; 10^{15}$~M$_\odot$. This sample, EXCPRES (Evolution of X-ray galaxy Cluster Properties in a Representative Sample), is used to test and validate a new method to produce optimally-binned cluster X-ray temperature profiles. The method uses a dynamic programming algorithm, based on partitioning of the soft-band X-ray surface brightness profile, to obtain a binning scheme that optimally fulfils a given signal-to-noise threshold criterion out to large radius. From the resulting optimally-binned EXCPRES temperature profiles, and combining with those from the local REXCESS sample, we provide a generic scaling relation between the relative error on the temperature and the [0.3-2] keV surface brightness signal-to-noise ratio, and its dependence on temperature and redshift. We derive an average scaled 3D temperature profile for the sample. Comparing to the average scaled 3D temperature profiles from REXCESS, we find no evidence for evolution of the average profile shape within the redshift range that we probe.</description>

      <title>Magnetar-powered Neutrinos and Magnetic Moment Signatures at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IceCube collaboration pioneered the detection of $\mathcal{O}{(\text{PeV})}$ neutrino events and the identification of astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we explore scenarios in which high-energy neutrinos are produced in the vicinity of astrophysical objects with strong magnetic field, such as magnetars. While propagating through such magnetic field, neutrinos experience spin precession induced by their magnetic moments, and this impacts their helicity and flavor composition at Earth. Considering both flavor composition of high-energy neutrinos and Glashow resonance events we find that detectable signatures may arise at neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube, for presently unconstrained neutrino magnetic moments in the range between $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})~\mu_B$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})~\mu_B$.</description>

      <title>Neutron star matter as a dilute solution of protons in neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars contain neutron-rich matter with around 5% protons at nuclear saturation density. In this Letter, we consider equilibrium between bulk phases of matter based on asymmetric nuclear matter calculations using chiral effective field theory interactions rather than, as has been done in the past, by interpolation between the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Neutron drip (coexistence of nuclear matter with pure neutrons) is well established, but from earlier work it is unclear whether proton drip (equilibrium between two phases, both of which contain protons and neutrons) is possible. We find that proton drip is a robust prediction of any physically reasonable equation of state, but that it occurs over a limited region of densities and proton fractions. An analytical model based on expanding the energy in powers of the proton density, rather than the neutron excess, is able to account for these features of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix methods are widely used to predict how accurately parameters can be estimated. Being computationally efficient, this approach is prompted by the large number of signals simulated in forecast studies for future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, for which adequate analysis tools and computational resources are still unavailable to the scientific community. However, approximating the full likelihood function with a Gaussian may lead to inaccuracies, which we investigate in this work. To assess the accuracy of the Fisher approximation, we compare the results of the Fisher code GWFish against real data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) provided by the Virgo/LIGO Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we present a sampling algorithm to include priors in GWFish, not only to ensure a fair comparison between GWFish results and the Virgo/LIGO posteriors but also to investigate the role of prior information and to assess the need to include it in standard Fisher analyses. We find that the impact of priors depends mostly on the level of signal-dependent degeneracy of the waveform parameterization, and priors are generally more important when the level of degeneracy is high. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>
