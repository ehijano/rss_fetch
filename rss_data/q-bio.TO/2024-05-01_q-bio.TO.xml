      <title>A Two-Phase Model of Early Atherosclerotic Plaque Development with LDL Toxicity Effects</title>

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease in which fatty plaque is built inside an artery wall. Early atherosclerotic plaque development is typically characterised by inflammatory tissues primarily consisting of foam cells and macrophages. We present a multiphase model that explores early plaque growth to emphasise the role of cytokines (in particular, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in monocyte recruitment and foam cell production, respectively. The plaque boundary is assumed to move at the same speed as the inflammatory tissues close to the periphery. This study discusses oxLDL-induced toxic environment towards macrophages and foam cells such that they start to die beyond a threshold limit of oxLDL concentration owing to excessive consumption. Our findings reveal that initially, the plaque evolves rapidly, and the growth rate subsequently reduces because of oxLDL-induced toxicity. In addition, it is observed that the saturation of inflammatory cell volume fraction becomes independent of oxLDL concentration beyond the threshold limit, referred to as the oxLDL toxicity limit. Our study manifests that increased oxLDL flux promotes flattened plaque growth through oxLDL-induced toxicity, while elevated cytokines flux disrupts the corresponding flattened behaviour. Detailed analysis of the model presented in this article unfolds critical insights into the various biochemical and cellular mechanisms behind early plaque development.</description>

      <title>Spatial information allows inference of the prevalence of direct cell-to-cell viral infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of direct cell-to-cell spread in viral infections - where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment - has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation-estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell-to-cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non-spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell-to-cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell-to-cell infection in $\textit{in vitro}$ and $\textit{in vivo}$ contexts.</description>
