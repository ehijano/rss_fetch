      <title>GEMS JWST: Transmission spectroscopy of TOI-5205b reveals significant stellar contamination and a metal-poor atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any $\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity ($\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio ($\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20%, which is $\sim100\times$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.</description>

      <title>TOI-2015b: a sub-Neptune in strong gravitational interaction with an outer non-transiting planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-2015 is a known exoplanetary system around an M4 dwarf star, consisting of a transiting sub-Neptune planet in a 3.35-day orbital period, TOI-2015b, accompanied by a non-transiting companion, TOI-2015c. High-precision RV measurements were taken with the MAROON-X spectrograph, and high-precision photometric data were collected several networks. We re-characterize the target star by combining optical spectr, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis. The TOI-2015 host star is a K=10.3mag M4-type dwarf with a sub-solar metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.31+/-0.16, and a Teff=3200K. Our photodynamical analysis of the system strongly favors the 5:3 mean motion resonance and in this scenario the planet b has an orbital period of 3.34days, a mass of Mp=9.02+/-0.34Me, a radius of Rp=3.309+/-0.012Re, resulting in a density of rhop= 1.40+/-0.06g/cm3, indicative of a Neptune like composition. Its transits exhibit large (&gt;1hr) timing variations indicative of an outer perturber in the system. We performed a global analysis of the high-resolution RV measurements, the photometric data, and the TTVs, and inferred that TOI-2015 hosts a second planet, TOI-2015c, in a non-transiting configuration. TOI-2015c has an orbital period of Pc=5.583days and a mass of Mp=8.91+0.38-0.40Me. The dynamical configuration of TOI-2015b and TOI-2015c can be used to constrain the system's planetary formation and migration history. Based on the mass-radius composition models, TOI-2015b is a water-rich or rocky planet with a hydrogen-helium envelope. Moreover, TOI-2015b has a high transmission spectroscopic metric (TSM=149), making it a favorable target for future transmission spectroscopic observations with JWST to constrain the atmospheric composition of the planet. Such observations would also help to break the degeneracies in theoretical models of the planet's interior structure.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: near-infrared and optical radial velocity analysis of Gl 480 and Gl 382 using SPIRou, HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Advancements in the field of exoplanetary research have extended radial velocity (RV) observations from the optical to the near-infrared (nIR) domain. M dwarf stars, characterized by their lower masses and higher prevalence of rocky planets, have become a focal point of investigation. This study uses data from the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou and data available in the literature from the HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs operating in the optical to analyze RVs of two nearby M dwarfs, Gl 480 and Gl 382.
  Aims: This work aims to detect and characterize exoplanetary companions around Gl 480 and Gl 382 by mitigating stellar activity effects through advanced data analysis techniques. The study seeks to improve the reliability of RV signals by integrating multi-wavelength observations and stellar activity diagnostics.
  Methods: The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines the line-by-line (LBL) framework with the Wapiti (Weighted principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon) method to correct for systematics in SPIRou data. Through an extensive analysis of available stellar activity indicators and by combining optical data from the HARPS and CARMENES instruments, we perform a joint analysis of RV measurements in both the nIR and optical domains.
  Results: Our analysis confirms the detection of a planet orbiting Gl 480 with a period of $9.5537 \pm 0.0005$ d and a minimum mass of $8.8 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$. Additionally, we detect a tentative signal at 6.4 d, whose significance depends strongly on the choice of Gaussian Process priors constrained by stellar activity indicators and would require further observations for confirmation. In contrast, no planetary signals are detected for Gl 382, where RV variations are dominated by stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Estimate the Mass Escaping Rates of Radius-valley-spanning Planets in TOI-431 System via XUV Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-431 system has 3 close-in exoplanets, which gives an ideal lab to study gas escape. In this study, we measure the XUV luminosity for TOI-431 with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and OM data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in the system. We find that, TOI-431 b's $\rm F_{XUV,b}=$$70286^{+12060}_{-2611}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ is 75 times of TOI-431 d $\rm F_{XUV,d}=$$935^{+160}_{-35}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Adopting the energy limit method and hydrodynamic code $ATES$ with a set of He/H ratios, we obtain the mass-loss rates of $10^{10.51^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 b, $10^{9.14^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ and $10^{9.84\sim 9.94}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 d. We predict the $2.93\sim 7.91 \%$ H I Ly$\alpha$ and $0.19\sim 10.65\%$ He I triplet absorption depths for TOI-431 d, thus its gas escaping is detectable in principle. For both TOI-431 b and d, we select similar planets from the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS) data. Then show that considering the mass-loss rates, TOI-431 b should be a naked solid planet, and TOI-431 d will likely maintain its gas envelope until the host star dies. According to the formation and evolution tracks, we find that TOI-431 b's potential birthplace (0.1-2 AU) should be inner than TOI-431 d (2-12 AU). Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the radius valley being caused by atmospheric escape. The intrinsic reason may be their birthplace, which will determine how close they can migrate to the host star, then lose mass and result in the Fulton gap.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reevaluation of the USP Classification Boundary: Smaller Planets Within 1 Day, Larger Period Ratios Below 2 Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial worlds with $P &lt; 1$ day, known as ultra-short period planets (USPs), comprise a physically distinct population whose origins may be attributed to various possible formation channels within multi-planet systems. However, the conventional 1 day boundary adopted for USPs is an arbitrary prescription, and it has yet to be evaluated whether this specific cutoff, or any alternatives, may emerge from the data with minimal assumptions. We accordingly present a statistical evaluation of the USP classification boundary for 376 multi-planet systems across Kepler, K2, and TESS. We find that USPs are smaller in size ($p = 0.004$) and exhibit larger period ratios with their immediate neighbors ($\mathcal{P} = P_{2}/P_{1}$; $p &lt; 10^{-4}$) when compared to non-USP short-period ($1 &lt; P/\text{days} &lt; 5$) worlds, and that these discrepancies rapidly transition towards statistical insignificance ($p &gt; 0.05$) at respective orbital periods of $P_{R} = 0.97^{+0.25}_{-0.19}$ days and $P_{\mathcal{P}} = 2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$ days (see Figure 3). We verify that these results are not driven by imprecise planetary parameters, giant companions, low-mass host stars, or detection biases. Our findings provide qualitative support for pathways in which proto-USPs are detached from companions and delivered to $P \lesssim 2$ days via eccentric migration, while a subset of these objects near $P \sim 1$ day experience subsequent orbital decay and refractory mass loss to become USPs. These results lend evidence towards an astrophysical basis for the 1 day USP cutoff and encourage consideration of an additional 2 day boundary within future investigations of USP architectures and evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cryoscope: A Cryogenic Infrared Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope -- a new 50 sq. deg field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, K-dark survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the K-dark passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation.</description>

      <title>A Tentative Detection of a Point Source in the Disk Gap of HD 100546 with VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS Sparse Aperture Masking Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-analyze VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS K and H-band sparse aperture masking interferometry data of the transition disk HD 100546 observed in 2018 and 2021, respectively. We fit geometrical models to the closure phases extracted from both datasets. We compare three model classes: a forward scattering disk, a forward scattering disk plus an arbitrary asymmetric disk feature and a forward scattering disk plus an unresolved point source in the disk-gap. We find that the forward scattering disk plus point source model is the best representation of the data. We find that this point source candidate moved from a position of sep. = $39.9^{+2.8}_{-3.3}$ mas, P.A. = $124.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ degrees to a sep. = $50.0^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ mas, P.A. = $106.4^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ degrees between 2018 and 2021. Both of these positions are well within the $\sim$13 au ($\sim$120 mas) disk-gap, favouring the point source interpretation. We explore the orbital parameter space that is consistent with the measured relative astrometry. We find orbits either with a similar orientation to the outer disk, with a high eccentricity $e \gtrapprox 0.65$, or orbits with a large relative inclination ($\sim$60 degrees) to the outer disk, and any eccentricity. Despite the significance of the observed point-source signal, follow-up observations will be necessary to conclusively determine its nature.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.3^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>
