      <title>On the theory of pseudo-balayage on a locally compact space and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under suitable requirements on a kernel on a locally compact space, we develop a theory of inner (outer) pseudo-balayage of quite general signed Radon measures (not necessarily of finite energy) onto quite general sets (not necessarily closed). Such investigations were initiated in Fuglede's work (Anal. Math., 2016), which was, however, mainly concerned with the outer pseudo-balayage of positive measures of finite energy, whereas treatment of signed measures of infinite energy requires essentially new methods and approaches. To illustrate this, it is enough to note that in the particular case of kernels satisfying the balayage principle, the pseudo-balayage of positive measures coincides with their balayage, whereas for signed measures, these two concepts are drastically different. The theory thereby established enables us to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the inner Gauss variational problem, a point of interest for a number of recent researches in constructive function theory. This study covers many interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which looks promising for further applications.</description>

      <title>Iterations of mean-type mappings and their convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define so-called residual means, which have a Taylor expansion of the form $M(x)=\bar x +\tfrac12 \xi_M(\bar x) \text{Var}(x)+o(\|x-\bar x\|^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha&gt;2$ and a single-variable function $\xi_M$ ($\bar x$~stands for the arithmetic mean of the vector $x$), and show that all symmetric means which are three times continuously differentiable are residual. We also calculate the value of residuum for quasideviation means and a few subclasses of this family.
  Later, we apply it to establish the limit of the sequence $\big(\frac{\text{Var}\ {\bf M}^{n+1}(x)}{(\text{Var}\ {\bf M}^n(x))^2}\big)_{n=1}^\infty$, where ${\bf M} \colon I^p\to I^p$ is a mean-type mapping consisting of $p$-variable residual means on an interval $I$, and $x \in I^p$ is a nonconstant vector.</description>

      <title>The Laplace asymptotic expansion in high dimensions: a nonasymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical Laplace asymptotic expansion of $\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x)e^{-nv(x)}dx$ in high dimensions $d$. We derive an error bound to the expansion when truncated to arbitrary order. The error bound is fully explicit except for absolute constants, and it depends on $d$, $n$, and operator norms of the derivatives of $v$ and $f$ in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $v$.</description>

      <title>The Sobolev extension problem on trees and in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite tree with radially decaying weights. We show that there exists a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for which the following two problems are equivalent: (1) Given a (real-valued) function $\phi$ on the leaves of $V$, extend it to a function $\Phi$ on all of $V$ so that $||\Phi||_{L^{1,p}(V)}$ has optimal order of magnitude. Here, $L^{1,p}(V)$ is a weighted Sobolev space on $V$. (2) Given a function $f:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, extend it to a function $F \in L^{2,p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ so that $||F||_{L^{2,p}(\mathbb{R}^2)}$ has optimal order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A second order approach to the Kato square root problem on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof for the Kato square root problem on suitable open sets and subject to pure Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to earlier work, our proof uses only second-order techniques and is in the spirit of the proof given by Egert--Haller--Monniaux--Tolksdorf in the scope of the 27th international internet seminar for $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$. In contrast to the usual proofs based on the first-order framework by Axelsson--Keith--McIntosh, the proof becomes substantially shorter and technically less demanding.</description>

      <title>Lower box dimension of infinitely generated self-conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the limit set of an infinite conformal iterated function system and let $F$ denote the set of fixed points of the maps. We prove that the box dimension of $\Lambda$ exists if and only if \[
  \overline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\leq \max \{\dim_{\mathrm H} \Lambda, \underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\}. \] In particular, this provides the first examples of sets of continued fraction expansions with restricted digits for which the box dimension does not exist.
  More generally, we establish an explicit asymptotic formula for the covering numbers $N_r(\Lambda)$ in terms of $\dim_{\mathrm H}\Lambda$ and the covering function $r\mapsto N_r(F)$, where $N_r(\cdot)$ denotes the least number of open balls of radius $r$ required to cover a given set. Such finer scaling information is necessary: in general, the lower box dimension $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ is not a function of the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda$ and the upper and lower box dimensions of $F$, and we prove sharp bounds for $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ in terms of these three quantities.</description>

      <title>A class of non linear adaptive time-frequency transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a couple of new time-frequency transforms, designed to adapt their scale to specific features of the analyzed function. Such an adaptation is implemented via so-called focus functions, which control the window scale as a function of the time variable, or the frequency variable. In this respect, these transforms are non-linear, which makes the analysis more complex than usual.Under appropriate assumptions, some norm control can be obtained for both transforms in L^2(R) spaces, which extend the classical continuous frame norm control and guarantees well-definedness on L^2. Given the non-linearity of the transforms, the existence of inverse transforms is not guaranteed anymore, and is an open question. However, the results of this paper represent a first step towards a more general theory.Besides mathematical results, some elementary examples of time and frequency focus functions are provided, which can serve as staring point for concrete applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integral representations of solutions to q-hypergeometric equation and its variant obtained through q-middle convolution by using transformation formulas for q-hypergeometric series. We show the correspondence between these integral solutions and solutions obtained through other methods. We also show the linear relationships among the integral solutions. Specifically, we provide an alternative proof for the connection formula for the standard form of q-hypergeometric equation.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for bi-Schr\"odinger operators on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing several types of $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators $W_\pm=W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ associated with the bi-Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^{2}+V(x)$ on the line $\mathbb{R}$. Given suitable decay potentials $V$, we firstly prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$: $$ \|W_\pm f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}+\|W_\pm^* f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}\lesssim \|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})},$$ which are further extended to the $L^p$-boundedness on the weighted spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R},w)$ with general even $A_p$-weights $w$ and to the boundedness on the Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$. For the limiting case, we prove that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^1(\R)$ to $L^{1,\infty}(\R)$ as well as bounded from the Hardy space $\H^1(\R)$ to $L^1(\R)$. These results especially hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a resonance of $H$. We also obtain that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ if zero is a regular point or a first kind resonance of $H$. Next, we show that $W_\pm$ are neither bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ nor on $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ even if zero is a regular point of $H$. Moreover, if zero is a second kind resonance of $H$, then $W_\pm$ are shown to be even not bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ in general. In particular, we remark that our results give a complete picture of the validity of $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for all $1\le p\le \infty$ in the regular case. Finally, as applications, we deduce the $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator $e^{-itH}P_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)$ with pairs $(1/p,1/q)$ belonging to a certain region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well as establish the H\"ormander-type $L^p$-boundedness theorem for the spectral multiplier $f(H)$.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the 3D Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ikoma (2022) considered optimal constants and extremisers for the $2$-dimensional Dirac equation using the spherical harmonics decomposition. Though its argument is valid in any dimensions $d \geq 2$, the case $d \geq 3$ remains open since it leads us to too complicated calculation: determining all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of infinite dimensional matrices. In this paper, we give optimal constants and extremisers of smoothing estimates for the $3$-dimensional Dirac equation. In order to prove this, we construct a certain orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics. With respect to this basis, infinite dimensional matrices actually become block diagonal and so that eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be easily found. As applications, we obtain the equivalence of the smoothing estimate for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the Dirac equation, and improve a result by Ben-Artzi and Umeda (2021).</description>

      <title>New characterization of weighted inequalities involving superposition of Hardy integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $0 &lt; q,r &lt; \infty$. We characterize the validity of the inequality for the composition of the Hardy operator, \begin{equation*} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^x \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)ds \bigg)^q u(t) dt \bigg)^{\frac{r}{q}} w(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{r}} \leq C \bigg(\int_a^b f(x)^p v(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{p}} \end{equation*} for all non-negative measurable functions $f$ on $(a,b)$, $-\infty \leq a &lt; b \leq \infty$. We construct a more straightforward discretization method than those previously presented in the literature, and we provide some new scales of weight characterizations of this inequality in both discrete and continuous forms and we obtain previous characterizations as the special case of the parameter.</description>
