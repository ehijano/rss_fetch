      <title>Trapping and cooling mechanisms in blue-detuned magneto-optical traps of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In red-detuned magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of molecules, sub-Doppler heating competes with Doppler cooling, resulting in high temperature and low density. A solution is offered by the blue-detuned MOT where sub-Doppler cooling dominates and the cloud is compressed. Several blue-detuned molecular MOTs have been implemented. A recent implementation relies on a pair of orthogonally polarized components whose frequency separation is smaller than the transition linewidth. We identify the trapping force in these MOTs. At a certain magnetic field, there is a state that is dark to the laser propagating in one direction, but not to the counter-propagating one. This Zeeman-induced dark state (ZIDS) sets up an imbalance in the photon scattering rate, leading to a restoring force. We also study the role of the moving lattices generated by the closely-spaced frequency components of the light. We show that there is a velocity-dependent force that drives the molecules towards the speeds of these moving lattices, and that over a relevant range of magnetic fields this combines with the ZIDS force to transport molecules towards the centre of the MOT. Here, gray molasses cooling, assisted by non-adiabatic transitions driven by the time-varying polarization of the light field, cools the molecules towards zero velocity. We study these mechanisms for model systems with simple level structures, then extend them to molecules with ground state hyperfine structure.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Dirac-Fock method combined with Core Polarization in calculations of alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the applicability of the core-polarization-corrected Dirac--Fock method, formulated within the framework of the local Dirac--Hartree--Fock (LDF) potential, for the accurate determination of static scalar and tensor electric dipole polarizabilities. This work presents theoretical values of blackbody-radiation-induced Stark shifts of atomic energy levels. The Dirac--Fock method augmented by core-polarization corrections is employed not only to evaluate these shifts but also to compute the Bethe logarithm for alkali-metal atoms. The results are critically compared with data available in the contemporary literature, and the strengths and limitations of the present approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Statistics and systematics of electron EDM searches with BaF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NL-$e$EDM experiment searches for a non-zero electric dipole moment of the electron $d_e$ ($e$EDM) in the ground state of barium monofluoride (BaF). A beam of BaF from a supersonic expansion source is probed with the spin precession method presented in \cite{Boeschoten2024}. This method permits the extraction of an $e$EDM value as well as values for parameters causing a possible systematic bias leading to a false $e$EDM. The currently achievable sensitivity is limited by statistics collected in a period of 34 hours and yields an $d_e$ of $2(3) \times 10^{-25}$ $e\,$cm. Furthermore, from the same dataset sufficiently strong limits on parameters which can induce a false $e$EDM are extracted. These are mainly the electric field \textbf{E} and the intensity of the lasers fields in the fiducial volume of the experiment. We summarize the steps required to upgrade of the experiment to reach a competitive level on $d_e$, e.g. an intense laser-cooled beam from a cryogenic buffer gas source and the light collection efficiency of fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of high-order harmonic radiation enhanced by XUV-driven electron-hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of high-order harmonic radiation with photon energies extending beyond the regular cutoff energy in standard high-order harmonic generation. The extension of the regular harmonic cutoff results from infrared (IR)-driven recombination of valence photoelectrons into a cationic core hole created by extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) excitation of inner-shell electrons into the transient valence hole in a combined XUV+IR configuration [Buth et al., Opt. Lett. 36, 3530 (2011)]. We show that the microscopic dipole phase at the extended harmonic frequencies is sensitive to the relative IR-XUV delay and IR intensity, whereas the corresponding signal intensity drops significantly for chirped XUV pulses with poor temporal coherence. We discuss the impact of such sensitivity on the macroscopic harmonic radiation, whereby decoherence among the dipole emitters may lead to further signal suppression.</description>

      <title>Coherent vibrational dynamics in molecular bond breaking: methyl radical umbrella mode probed by femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of coherent molecular vibrations launched by the breaking of a molecular bond. The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\,\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $\nu_2$ ``umbrella" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $\nu_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $\nu_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $\nu_2$ mode.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling and qubit measurements on a forbidden transition in neutral Cs atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01720v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate background-free, hyperfine-level-selective measurements of individual Cs atoms by simultaneous cooling to $5.3~\mu\rm K$ and imaging on the $6s_{1/2}\rightarrow 5d_{5/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition. We achieve hyperfine resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric and fast Rydberg gate protocol for long range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</description>

      <title>A matter-wave Fabry-P\'erot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</description>

      <title>Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.</description>

      <title>Bound-state-free F\"orster resonant shielding of strongly dipolar ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a F\"orster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.</description>
