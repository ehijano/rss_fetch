      <title>Sub-sub-intuitionistic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-sub-intuitionistic logic is obtained from intuitionistic logic by weakening the implication and removing distributivity. It can alternatively be viewed as conditional weak positive logic. We provide semantics for sub-sub-intuitionistic logic by means of semilattices with a selection function, prove a categorical duality for the algebraic semantics of the logic, and use this to derive completeness. We then consider the extension of sub-sub-intuitionistic logic with a variety of axioms.</description>

      <title>A logical framework for data-driven reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a family of consequence relations with the goal of capturing certain important patterns of data-driven inference. The inspiring idea for our framework is the fact that data may reject, possibly to some degree, and possibly by mistake, any given scientific hypothesis. There is no general agreement in science about how to do this, which motivates putting forward a logical formulation of the problem. We do so by investigating distinct definitions of "rejection degrees" each yielding a consequence relation. Our investigation leads to novel variations on the theme of rational consequence relations, prominent among non-monotonic logics.</description>

      <title>Uniform Borel amenability is equivalent to randomized hyperfiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measur</description>

      <title>Logic as an internal organisation of language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary semantic description of logic is based on the ontology of all possible interpretations, an insufficiently clear metaphysical concept. In this article, logic is described as the internal organization of language. Logical concepts -- logical constants, logical truths and logical consequence -- are defined using the internal syntactic and semantic structure of language. For a first-order language, it has been shown that its logical constants are connectives and a certain type of quantifiers for which the universal and existential quantifiers form a functionally complete set of quantifiers. Neither equality nor cardinal quantifiers belong to the logical constants of a first-order language.</description>

      <title>Model theory of valued fields with an endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish relative quantifier elimination for valued fields of residue characteristic zero enriched with a non-surjective valued field endomorphism, building on recent work of Dor and Halevi. In particular, we deduce relative quantifier elimination for the limit of the Frobenius action on separably closed valued fields of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Elements of affine model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By Lindstr\"{o}m's theorems, the expressive power of first order logic (and similarly continuous logic) is not strengthened without losing some interesting property. Weakening it, is however less harmless and has been payed attention by some authors. Affine continuous logic is the fragment of continuous logic obtained by avoiding the connectives $\wedge,\vee$. This reduction leads to the affinization of most basic tools and technics of continuous logic such as the ultraproduct construction, compactness theorem, type, saturation etc. The affine variant of the ultraproduct construction is the ultramean construction where ultrafilters are replaced with maximal finitely additive probability measures. A consequence of this relaxation is that compact structures with at least two elements have now proper elementary extensions. In particular, they have non-categorical theories in the new setting. Thus, a model theoretic framework for study of such structures is provided. A more remarkable aspect of this logic is that the type spaces are compact convex sets. The extreme types then play a crucial role in the study of affine theories. In this text, we present the foundations of affine continuous model theory.</description>
