      <title>Witness Set in Monotone Polygons: Exact and Approximate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple polygon $\mathscr{P}$, two points $x$ and $y$ within $\mathscr{P}$ are {\em visible} to each other if the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathscr{P}$. The {\em visibility region} of a point $x$ includes all points in $\mathscr{P}$ that are visible from $x$. A point set $Q$ within a polygon $\mathscr{P}$ is said to be a \emph{witness set} for $\mathscr{P}$ if each point in $\mathscr{P}$ is visible from at most one point from $Q$. The problem of finding the largest size witness set in a given polygon was introduced by Amit et al. [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 2010]. Recently, Daescu et al. [Comput. Geom. 2019] gave a linear-time algorithm for this problem on monotone mountains. In this study, we contribute to this field by obtaining the largest witness set within both continuous and discrete models.
  In the {\sc Witness Set (WS)} problem, the input is a polygon $\mathscr{P}$, and the goal is to find a maximum-sized witness set in $\mathscr{P}$. In the {\sc Discrete Witness Set (DisWS)} problem, one is given a finite set of points $S$ alongside $\mathscr{P}$, and the task is to find a witness set $Q \subseteq S$ that maximizes $|Q|$. We investigate {\sc DisWS} in simple polygons, but consider {\sc WS} specifically for monotone polygons. Our main contribution is as follows: (1) a polynomial time algorithm for {\sc DisWS} for general polygons and (2) the discretization of the {\sc WS} problem for monotone polygons. Specifically, given a monotone polygon with $r$ reflex vertices, and a positive integer $k$ we generate a point set $Q$ with size $r^{O(k)} \cdot n$ such that $Q$ contains an witness set of size $k$ (if exists). This leads to an exact algorithm for {\sc WS} problem in monotone polygons running in time $r^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. We also provide a PTAS for this with running time $r^{O(1/\epsilon)} n^2$.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Polynomial Time Algorithm for 3-Coloring Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a circle graph if it is an intersection graph of chords of a unit circle. We give an algorithm that takes as input an $n$ vertex circle graph $G$, runs in time at most $n^{O(\log n)}$ and finds a proper $3$-coloring of $G$, if one exists. As a consequence we obtain an algorithm with the same running time to determine whether a given ordered graph $(G, \prec)$ has a $3$-page book embedding. This gives a partial resolution to the well known open problem of Dujmovi\'{c} and Wood [Discret. Math. Theor. Comput. Sci. 2004], Eppstein [2014], and Bachmann, Rutter and Stumpf [J. Graph Algorithms Appl. 2024] of whether 3-Coloring on circle graphs admits a polynomial time algorithm.</description>
