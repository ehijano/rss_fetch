      <title>Invariance of the Hausdorff Dimension of McMullen-Bedford Carpets under Coordinate Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of the self-affine carpets of Bedford and McMullen where the defining iterated function system includes coordinate reflections. We show that the Hausdorff dimension is invariant under such reflections. The upper bound follows from the standard covering argument using approximate squares, while the lower bound is established by constructing a dimension-maximizing Bernoulli measure and applying the Ledrappier-Young formula. The key to the proof is the observation that the fiber entropies determining the dimension are invariant under the action of the reflection group.</description>

      <title>Shortest distance between observed orbits in distinct Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the shortest distance between observed orbits in two distinct dynamical systems. Given two measure-preserving transformations $(X, T, \mu)$ and $(X, S, \eta)$ and a Lipschitz observation function $f$, we define \[ \widehat{m}_n^f(x,y) = \min_{i=0,\ldots,n-1} d\big(f(T^i x), f(S^i y)\big). \] %Under suitable mixing assumptions, we show that the asymptotic rate of decay of $\widehat{m}_n^f(x,y)$ is governed by the correlation dimensions of the pushforward measures $f_*\mu$ and $f_*\eta$. Under suitable mixing assumptions, we show that the asymptotic rate of decay of $\widehat{m}_n^f(x,y)$ is governed by the symmetric R\'enyi divergence of the pushforward measures $f_*\mu$ and $f_*\eta$. Our results generalize previous work that consider either a single system or the unobserved case. In addition, we discuss the extension of these results to random dynamical systems and illustrate the applicability of the approach with an example.</description>

      <title>Synchronization by degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive several criteria for (weak) synchronization by noise without the global swift transitivity property. Our sufficient conditions for (weak) synchronization are necessary and can be applied to scenarios involving degenerate or non-Gaussian noise. These results partially answer the open question posed by Flandoli et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 168:511-556, 2017). As an application, we prove that the weak attractor for stochastic Lorenz 63 systems driven by degenerate noise consists of a single random point provided the noise intensity is small, and there is no weak synchronization if the noise intensity is large. This indicates that a bifurcation occurs in relation to the intensity of the noise.</description>

      <title>The Narrow Corridor of Stable Solutions in an Extended Osipov--Lanchester Model with Constant Total Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a modification of the classical Osipov--Lanchester model in which the total population of the two forces $N=R+B$ is preserved over time. It is shown that the dynamics of the ratio $y=R/B$ reduce to the Riccati equation $\dot y=\alpha y^2-\beta$, which admits a complete analytical study. The main result is that asymptotically stable invariant sets in the positive quadrant $R,B\ge 0$ exist exactly in three sign cases of $(\alpha,\beta)$: (i) $\alpha&lt;0,\beta&lt;0$ (stable interior equilibrium), (ii) $\alpha=0,\beta&lt;0$ (the face $B=0$ is stable), (iii) $\alpha&lt;0,\beta=0$ (the face $R=0$ is stable). For $\alpha&gt;0$ or $\beta&gt;0$ the solutions reach the boundaries of applicability of the model in finite time. Moreover, $\alpha&lt;0,\beta&lt;0$ corresponds to exponential growth of solutions in the original system. Passing to a model perturbed in $\alpha(t),\beta(t)$ requires buffer dynamics repelling from the axes to preserve stability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Attraction-Repulsion on Multilayer Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic pairwise \emph{attraction--repulsion} model for opinion dynamics on multilayer social networks, in which agents hold layer-specific states and interact through random matchings that couple multiple, time-varying layers. At each time step, interacting pairs update their layer-specific states using layer-dependent, time-varying interaction rates and a random sign (attractive or repulsive), and the resulting updates are averaged across layers. This framework generalizes classical gossip and Deffuant-type models while capturing heterogeneous cross-layer influences and antagonistic interactions.
  Under mild graph-theoretic and moment assumptions, we establish almost sure global consensus. Specifically, when the expected net effect of interactions is strictly attractive and random matchings ensure sufficient cross-layer connectivity, all agents' layer states converge almost surely to the global average. We further identify a purely attractive regime in which consensus holds even under intermittent connectivity and without any moment assumptions on the initial states. Numerical experiments illustrate the dynamical regimes predicted by the theory, including consensus, metastability, and polarization. Together, these results provide a rigorous foundation for understanding how multilayer structure, stochastic interactions, and mixed-sign influence shape collective outcomes in social and engineered networked systems.</description>

      <title>Merge on workspaces as Hopf algebra Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of a Hopf algebra Markov chain with state space the binary rooted forests with labelled leaves. This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.</description>

      <title>The cyclicity of period annulus of cubic isochronous Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cima, Ma\~{n}osas and Villadelprat (J. Differ. Equations, 157, 373--413, 1999) proved that a cubic Hamiltonian system possesses an isochronous center at the origin if and only if its Hamiltonian function can be expressed as \begin{eqnarray*}H_1(x,y)=k_1^2x^2+(k_2y+k_3x+k_4x^2)^2, \end{eqnarray*} where $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4\in\mathbb{R}$, $k_1k_2\neq0$. This paper is devoted to investigating the weak Hilbert's 16th problem for the dynamical system associated with the above Hamiltonian function. We show that the maximum number of limit cycles is $n-1$. Furthermore, this number is reached. That is, we solve the weak Hilbert's 16th problem restricted to cubic Hamiltonian systems with an isochronous center at the origin.</description>

      <title>Classical billiards can compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Random Homogeneous Self-Similar Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a class of invariant measures generated by a random homogeneous self-similar iterated function system. Unlike the deterministic setting, the random quantization problem requires controlling distortion errors across non-uniform scales. For $r&gt;0$, under a suitable separation condition, we precisely determine the almost sure quantization dimension $\kappa_r$ of this class, by utilizing the ergodic theory of the shift map on the symbolic space. By imposing an additional separation condition, we establish almost sure positivity of the $\kappa_r$-dimensional lower quantization coefficient. Furthermore, without assuming any separation condition, we provide a sufficient condition that guarantees almost sure finiteness of the $\kappa_r$-dimensional upper quantization coefficient. We also include some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Investigating Hamiltonian Dynamics by the Method of Covariant Lyapunov Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we review the theory of Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and use these objects to numerically investigate the dynamics of several autonomous Hamiltonian systems. The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&amp;C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&amp;C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the H\'enon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&amp;C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the H\'enon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability for recurrent clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework to show the indistinguishability of infinite clusters (ergodicity of the cluster subrelation) in group-invariant percolation processes with a weaker version of the finite energy property: the possibility of moving infinite branches from one infinite cluster to another. Crucially, this removes the necessity for the infinite clusters to be transient, present in most previous works. Our method also applies to more general random graphs, whenever a stationary sequence of vertices is definable.
  We use this to show the indistinguishability of infinite clusters (or permutation cycles) in the interchange process (a.k.a.~random stirring process), the loop $O(n)$ model on amenable Cayley graphs, biased corner percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the Poisson Zoo process.
  Finally, we show that infinite clusters in any invariant process on a Cayley graph are indistinguishable for any ``not essentially tail'' property, i.e., properties that depend only on the local structure of the cluster.</description>

As an application, we show that Betti numbers of nilpotent groups are invariant by mutually cobounded $\textrm L^p$-measure equivalence. We also use this to obtain new vanishing results for non-cocompact lattices in rank 1 simple Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the family of Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ given by independent but not necessarily identically distributed and possibly unbounded potentials. We assume a finite exponential moment and allow the choice of distributions to come from any compact set away from deterministic distributions. With these assumptions we prove spectral localization with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions as well as dynamical localization. One of the main tools is a Furstenberg-type theorem for non-stationary matrix products.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for a class of resonant problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider radially symmetric solutions for a class of resonant problems on a unit ball $B \subset R^n$ around the origin \[ \Delta u+\la _1 u +g(u)=f(r) \s \mbox{for $x \in B$}, \s u=0 \s \mbox{on $\partial B$} \,. \] Here the function $g(u)$ is periodic of mean zero, $x \in R^n$, $r=|x|$, $\la _1$ is the principal eigenvalue of $\Delta$ on $B$. The problem has either infinitely many or finitely many solutions depending on the space dimension $n$. The situation turns out to be different for each of the following cases: $1 \leq n \leq 3$, $n=4$, $n=5$, $n=6$, and $n \geq 7$.</description>

      <title>Geometry-dependent Ekman layer approximations on curved domains: L^{\infty} convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ekman boundary layer is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that describes fluid motion near boundaries affected by Earth's rotation. Most theoretical studies have simplified their analysis by assuming a planar boundary surface, resulting in limited exploration of structures with general smooth boundary conditions. Investigating the impact of boundary geometry in the Ekman boundary layer is essential, as initially suggested by J.L. Lions and further examined in Masmoudi's study [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432-483] under small amplitude periodic boundary conditions. This paper clarifies how boundary geometry influences flow fields and characterizes its effects on near-boundary layer flow. We construct a class of multi-scale approximate solutions based on the boundary's geometric features and establish their convergence in the L^{\infty} framework. Our findings do not require a small-amplitude assumption, only an upper bound on the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. Notably, when the boundary is planar, our approach aligns with existing studies. Additionally, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, we derive a limiting-state system dependent on boundary geometric parameters. These contributions extend the theoretical understanding of boundary-layer interactions to general curved geometries and have possible applications in atmospheric, oceanic, and other geophysical flow contexts.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling through Spectral Analysis of Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a generative modeling framework that combines operator-theoretic spectral analysis with optimal transport. The novel insight is that the spectral structure required for accelerated Wasserstein gradient descent can be directly estimated from trajectory data via Koopman operator approximation which can eliminate the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential or neural network training. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and establish connection to Feynman-Kac theory that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments across diverse settings, including compact manifold sampling, metastable multi-well systems, image generation, and high dimensional stochastic partial differential equation, demonstrate that KSWGD consistently achieves faster convergence than other existing methods while maintaining high sample quality.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit infinite family of pairwise non-isomorphic infinite simple groups of type $\mathrm{F}_\infty$ (in particular, they are finitely presented) that act faithfully on the circle by orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, but that admit no non-trivial piecewise affine nor piecewise projective actions on the projective line. Our examples are certain forest-skein groups which, informally, are a mixture of Richard Thompson's groups with Vaughan Jones' planar algebras.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level Optimal Control Framework For Missed-Thrust-Design With First-Order Bounds On Maximum Missed-Thrust-Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a bi-level optimal control framework for designing low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with robustness against missed-thrust-events. The upper-level (UL) problem generates a nominal trajectory assuming full control authority, while each lower-level (LL) problem computes the optimal recovery maneuver following a missed-thrust-event along the nominal solution. Under suitable regularity conditions ensuring uniqueness and smoothness of the LL response, the hierarchy admits a single-level reformulation by embedding the LL first-order optimality conditions within the UL constraints. We further establish a robustness certificate, which provides an upper bound on the maximum admissible missed-thrust-duration for which the structural assumptions remain valid for the LL problem. The bound depends explicitly on precomputable dynamical quantities along the nominal solution, enabling rapid evaluation over large ensembles without iterative solves. Numerical experiments show that while the certificate identifies when modeling assumptions are valid, it does not fully characterize recoverability after missed-thrust-events. A finite-horizon controllability-energy analysis is therefore used to interpret recovery beyond the theoretical bounds. Collectively, these results provide a deterministic, certifiable approach for incorporating robustness directly into trajectory design, replacing post-hoc margin allocation techniques with formal guarantees.</description>

      <title>Randomized time stepping of nonlinearly parametrized solutions of evolution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Frenkel variational principle is a widely used building block for using nonlinear parametrizations in the context of model reduction and numerically solving partial differential equations; however, it typically leads to time-dependent least-squares problems that are poorly conditioned. This work introduces a randomized time stepping scheme that solves at each time step a low-dimensional, random projection of the parameter vector via sketching. The sketching has a regularization effect that leads to better conditioned least-squares problems and at the same time reduces the number of unknowns that need to be solved for at each time step. Numerical experiments with benchmark examples demonstrate that randomized time stepping via sketching achieves competitive accuracy and outperforms standard regularization in terms of runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Variation of entropy in the Duffing system with the amplitude of the external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the well-known perturbed Duffing system and investigate its chaotic dynamics by means of numerical Runge--Kutta method based on topological horseshoe theory. Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system.
  Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows.</description>

      <title>Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) on $[0,1]$ with resetting at $0$ and depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In the singular vanishing limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ we prove that the `` resetting '' simple point process associated to the PDMP converges to a point process described by a jump Markov process decorated by ``spikes'' distributed as a time-space Poisson point process with intensity proportional to $dt \otimes x^{-2} dx$. This proves rigorously results appeared previously in \cite{SBDKC25} and also justifies partially a conjecture formulated there.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use the methods and results of symplectic homogenization (see [V4]) to prove existence of periodic orbits and invariant measures with rotation number depending on the differential of the Homogenized Hamiltonian. We also prove the Conley conjecture on the cotangent bundle of the torus. Both proofs rely on Symplectic Homogenization and a refinement of it.</description>

Abstract: We obtain sharp rotation bounds for homeomorphisms $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ whose distortion is in $L^p_{loc}$, $p\geq1$, and whose inverse have controlled modulus of continuity. The motivation to study this class of maps comes from so-called Yudovich solutions to planar Euler equations. Furthermore, we present examples proving sharpness in a strong sense, thereby settling the borderline case $p=1$ in \cite[Theorem 3]{CHS}.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Zero Distribution: Implications and Applications in Control Theory for Yitang Zhang's Landau Siegel Zero Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the realm of chaotic dynamics derived from Dirichlet L-functions, drawing inspiration from Yitang Zhang's groundbreaking work on Landau-Siegel zeros. The dynamic behavior reveals profound chaos, corroborated by the calculated Lyapunov exponents and entropy, attesting to the system's inherent unpredictability.
  Furthermore, we establish a novel connection between Fractal geometry and Quantum chaos, predicting the distributions of zeros for both Yitang dynamics and Riemann dynamics. These findings offer indirect support for Zhang's groundbreaking theorem concerning Landau-Siegel zeros and suggest that these chaotic dynamics could find application in engineering and control systems, demonstrating the potential to harness chaos for beneficial purposes.
  The exploration of stability within electrical systems further uncovers the instability of fixed points, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for harnessing chaotic behavior to achieve specific control objectives.
  This study not only contributes to our understanding of chaotic dynamics but also opens new avenues for exploring the potential applications of Yitang dynamics in the field of electrical control systems. It paves the way for innovative approaches to address real-world engineering challenges and may be considered as a new consequence for the generalized Riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the Variational Principle and develop thermodynamic formalism for correspondences. We define the measure-theoretic entropy for transition probability kernels and topological pressure for correspondences. Based on these two notions, we establish the following results:
  The Variational Principle holds and equilibrium states exist for continuous potential functions, provided that the correspondence satisfies some expansion property called forward expansiveness. If, in addition, the correspondence satisfies the specification property and the potential function is Bowen summable, then the equilibrium state is unique. On the other hand, for a distance-expanding, open, strongly transitive correspondence and a H\"{o}lder continuous potential function, there exists a unique equilibrium state, and the backward orbits are equidistributed. Furthermore, we investigate the Variational Principle for general correspondences.
  In complex dynamics, we establish the Variational Principle for the Lee-Lyubich-Markorov-Mukherjee anti-holomorphic correspondences, which are matings of some anti-ho\-lo\-mor\-phic rational maps with anti-Hecke groups and are not forward expansive. We also show a Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius theorem for a family of hyperbolic holomorphic correspondences of the form $\boldsymbol{f}_c (z)= z^{q/p}+c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all of the boundary vertices except one, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time T &gt; 0. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have discussed the dynamics of composite entire functions in terms of relationship between bungee set, escaping set and filled-in Julia set. We have established some relation between the dynamics of composition of entire functions and the functions taken for composition. We have shown that the union of the bungee set of two entire functions contains the bungee set of the composite function. In addition, it is shown that the filled-in Julia set of composite entire functions contains the filled-in Julia set of functions used for the composition. The results have been illustrated with several examples. We have mostly dealt with permutable(commuting) functions.</description>

      <title>Normal Singular Geodesics of a Conformally Generic Sub-Riemannian Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a Ma\~n\'e generic real-analytic $D$-Hamiltonian H, subjected to a totally non-holonomic real-analytic distribution $D$, has no non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits of minimal rank. If $D$ has co-rank 1, this implies that $H + u$, where $u$ is a generic real-analytic potential, does not admit non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits.</description>

      <title>Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor. Previous work has shown that transfer learning can be used effectively with ESNs for single-orbit prediction. The novelty of our paper lies in our use of this pairing to predict the long-term statistical properties of spatiotemporally chaotic PDEs. We also show that transfer learning nontrivially improves the length of time that predictions of individual gKS trajectories remain accurate.</description>

      <title>Strong Lyapunov functions for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Lyapunov function technique, a fundamental tool for investigating asymptotic stability and existence of attractors for ordinary differential equations, by introducing the notion of a {\it strong Lyapunov function} for an autonomous drift under stochastic perturbation driven by general H\"older-continuous multiplicative noise, not necessarily Brownian.
  The mathematical setting within which our method proceeds consists of rough path calculus and the framework of random dynamical systems. We conclude that if such a function exists for the drift then the perturbed system admits a global random pullback attractor that is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity coefficient and the dyadic approximation of the noise. Moreover, in case the drift is globally Lipschitz continuous, then there exists a numerical attractor for the discretization which is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity and converges to the continuous attractor as the step size tends to zero. Several applications, including dissipative systems, the pendulum, the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuro-system and the Lorenz system, demonstrate the power of our approach. We also prove that strong Lyapunov functions can be approximated in practice by Lyapunov neural networks.</description>

      <title>Dimensions and dimension spectra of Non-autonomous iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-autonomous iterated function systems are a generalization of iterated function systems. If the contractions in the system are conformal mappings, it is called a non-autonomous conformal iterated function system, and its attractor is called a non-autonomous conformal set. In this paper, we study intermediate dimension spectra of non-autonomous conformal sets which provide a unifying framework for Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions. First, we obtain the intermediate dimension spectra formula of non-autonomous conformal sets by using upper and lower topological pressures. As a consequence, we obtain simplified forms of their Hausdorff, packing and box dimensions. Finally, we explore the Hausdorff dimensions of the non-autonomous infinite conformal iterated function systems which consists of countably many conformal mappings at each level, and we provide the Hausdorff dimension formula under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have been widely used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric-type inequalities for Mather's $\beta$-function of convex billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss pointwise spectral rigidity results for several billiard systems (e.g., Birkhoff billiards, symplectic billiards and $4$-th billiards), showing that a single value of Mather's $\beta$-function can determine whether a strongly convex smooth planar domain is a disk (or an ellipse, in the affine-invariant case of symplectic billiards). Evoking the famous question "Can you hear the shape of a billiard?", one could say that circular billiards can be heard by a single whisper! More specifically, we prove isoperimetric-type inequalities comparing the $\beta$-function associated to the billiard map of domain to that of a disk with the same perimeter or area, and investigate what are the consequences of having an equality. Surprisingly, this rigidity fails for outer billiards, where explicit counterexamples are constructed for rotation numbers $1/3$ and $1/4$. The results are framed within Aubry-Mather theory and provide a modern dynamical reinterpretation and extension of classical geometric inequalities for extremal polygons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results.
  Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as patterns of zeros in the multibase expansion. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We give lower bounds in terms of~$n,$ for the number of limit cycles of polynomial vector fields of degree~$n,$ having any prescribed invariant algebraic curve. By applying them when the ovals of this curve are also algebraic limit cycles we obtain a new recurrent property for the Hilbert numbers. Finally, we apply our results to two important families of models: Kolmogorov systems and a general family of systems appearing in Game Theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the complexity of the approximation of nonadmissible curves for nonlinear control-affine systems satisfying the strong H{\"o}rmander condition. Focusing on tubular approximation complexities, we provide asymptotic equivalences, with explicit constants, for all generic situations where the distribution, i.e., the linear part of the control system, is of co-rank one. Namely, we consider curves in step 2 distributions and any dimension. In the 3 dimensional case, we also consider the case of distributions with Martinet-type singularities that are crossed by the curve at isolated points.</description>

Abstract: We give a conditional proof of the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture of Morton and Silverman in the case of polynomials over number fields, assuming a standard conjecture in arithmetic geometry. Our technique simultaneously yields a dynamical analogue of Lang's conjecture on minimal canonical heights for these maps. We obtain similar results for non-isotrivial polynomials over a function field of characteristic zero. When the latter are unicritical of degree at least 5, the results hold unconditionally.</description>

Abstract: For all Zarski dense Anosov subgroups of a semisimple real algebraic group, we prove that their limit sets are Ahlfors regular for intrinsic conformal premetrics. As a consequence, we obtain that a Patterson-Sullivan measure is Ahlfors regular (and hence equal to the Hausdorff measure) if and only if the associated linear form is symmetric. We also discuss several applications, including analyticity of $(p,q)$-Hausdorff dimensions on the Teichm\"uller spaces, new upper bounds on the growth indicator, and $L^2$-spectral properties of associated locally symmetric manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. Our motivating example is the substitution presented in Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku \cite{DBZ}, which features a substitution matrix with non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector encodes the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. The patch frequencies are shown to be uniformly convergent, implying that the corresponding dynamical system is uniquely ergodic. Under mild assumptions, we further prove that the associated expansion constant is always an algebraic integer. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with illegal (partial) overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We provide a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, ensuring that no such illegal tiles emerge. Finally, we construct many intriguing one-dimensional overlapping substitutions and present higher dimensional examples from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>

Abstract: We study the counting function of rational approximations with given bounds on the denominator and satisfying the critical Dirichlet exponent on the sphere $S^d$, $d\geq 3$. We give an effective estimate for this counting function, with an error term of square root order, analogous to the optimal estimate in the Euclidean setting. We also show that the counting function has vanishing third and higher correlations and derive a Central Limit Theorem describing its fluctuations. We prove these results using arguments from homogeneous dynamics on the space of orthogonal lattices, in particular effective multiple equidistribution of all orders, which we establish for spherical averages and which could be useful for other applications.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>
