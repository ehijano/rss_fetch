      <title>Symplectic Homology and 3-dimensional Besse Manifolds with vanishing first Chern class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show that one can use certain types of symplectic homology as an invariant of 3-dimensional Besse manifolds, which are contact manifolds admitting a periodic Reeb flow and hence allow Seifert fibration structure. For simplicity, we will assume our contact structures to be trivial plane bundles. We will also compute Robbin-Salamon indices of periodic Reeb orbits in Besse manifolds and obtain more precise information about the symplectic homology. In the computations, invariants of the Seifert fibration such as the Euler number and the orbifold Euler characteristic play an important role.</description>

      <title>Cartan Geometry and Infinite-Dimensional Kempf-Ness Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pioneer the development of a rigorous infinite-dimensional framework for the Kempf-Ness theorem, addressing the significant challenge posed by the absence of a complexification for the symmetry group in infinite dimensions, e.g, the diffeomorphism group. We propose a novel approach, based on Cartan bundles, to generalize Kempf-Ness theory to infinite dimensions, invoking the fundamental role played by the Maurer-Cartan form. This approach allows us to define and study objects essential for the Kempf-Ness theorem, such as the complex model for orbits and the Kempf-Ness function, as well as establishing its convexity properties and defining a generalized Futaki character. We show how our framework can be applied to the study of various problems in K\"ahler geometry, deformation quantization, and gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fluid computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1991, Moore [20] raised a question about whether hydrodynamics is capable of performing computations. Similarly, in 2016, Tao [25] asked whether a mechanical system, including a fluid flow, can simulate a universal Turing machine. In this expository article, we review the construction in [8] of a "Fluid computer" in dimension 3 that combines techniques in symbolic dynamics with the connection between steady Euler flows and contact geometry unveiled by Etnyre and Ghrist. In addition, we argue that the metric that renders the vector field Beltrami cannot be critical in the Chern-Hamilton sense [9]. We also sketch the completely different construction for the Euclidean metric in $\mathbb R^3$ as given in [7]. These results reveal the existence of undecidable fluid particle paths. We conclude the article with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Floer theory on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop connections between the qualitative dynamics of Hamiltonian isotopies on a surface $\Sigma$ and their chain-level Floer theory using ideas drawn from Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's theory of finite energy foliations. We associate to every collection of capped $1$-periodic orbits which is `maximally unlinked relative the Morse range' a singular foliation on $S^1 \times \Sigma$ which is positively transverse to the vector field $\partial_t \oplus X^H$ and which is assembled in a straight-forward way from the relevant Floer moduli spaces. This provides a Floer-theoretic method for producing foliations of the type which appear in Le Calvez's theory of positively transverse foliations for surface homeomorphisms. Additionally, we provide a purely topological characterization of those Floer chains which both represent the fundamental class in $CF_*(H,J)$, and which lie in the image of some chain-level PSS map. This leads to the definition of a novel family of spectral invariants which share many of the same formal properties as the Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants, and we compute the novel spectral invariant associated to the fundamental class in entirely dynamical terms. This significantly extends a project initiated by Humili\`{e}re-Le Roux-Seyfaddini in arXiv:1502.03834.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to Viterbo's Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a counterexample to Viterbo's volume-capacity conjecture based on Minkowski billiard dynamics. This implies in particular that symplectic capacities differ on the class of convex domains in the classical phase space.</description>

      <title>New and improved bounds on the contextuality degree of multi-qubit configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present algorithms and a C code to reveal quantum contextuality and evaluate the contextuality degree (a way to quantify contextuality) for a variety of point-line geometries located in binary symplectic polar spaces of small rank. With this code we were not only able to recover, in a more efficient way, all the results of a recent paper by de Boutray et al [(2022). Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 55 475301], but also arrived at a bunch of new noteworthy results. The paper first describes the algorithms and the C code. Then it illustrates its power on a number of subspaces of symplectic polar spaces whose rank ranges from 2 to 7. The most interesting new results include: (i) non-contextuality of configurations whose contexts are subspaces of dimension 2 and higher, (ii) non-existence of negative subspaces of dimension 3 and higher, (iii) considerably improved bounds for the contextuality degree of both elliptic and hyperbolic quadrics for rank 4, as well as for a particular subgeometry of the three-qubit space whose contexts are the lines of this space, (iv) proof for the non-contextuality of perpsets and, last but not least, (v) contextual nature of a distinguished subgeometry of a multi-qubit doily, called a two-spread, and computation of its contextuality degree. Finally, in the three-qubit polar space we correct and improve the contextuality degree of the full configuration and also describe finite geometric configurations formed by unsatisfiable/invalid constraints for both types of quadrics as well as for the geometry whose contexts are all 315 lines of the space.</description>
