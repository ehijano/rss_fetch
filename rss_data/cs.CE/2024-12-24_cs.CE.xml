      <title>A Layered Swarm Optimization Method for Fitting Battery Thermal Runaway Models to Accelerating Rate Calorimetry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16367v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium ion batteries is a critical safety concern for the battery industry due to its potential to cause uncontrolled temperature rises and subsequent fires that can engulf the battery pack and its surroundings. Modeling and simulation offer cost effective tools for designing strategies to mitigate thermal runaway. Accurately simulating the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway,commonly represented by systems of Arrhenius based Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), requires fitting kinetic parameters to experimental calorimetry data, such as Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC) measurements. However, existing fitting methods often rely on empirical assumptions and simplifications that compromise generality or require manual tuning during the fitting process. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) offers a promising approach for directly fitting kinetic parameters to experimental data. Yet, for systems involving large search spaces, such as those created by multiple Arrhenius ODEs, the computational cost of fitting can become prohibitive. This work introduces a divide and conquer approach based on PSO to fit N equation Arrhenius ODE models to ARC data. The proposed method achieves accurate parameter fitting while maintaining low computational costs. The resulting fit is analyzed using two distinct ARC datasets, highlighting the methods flexibility. The resulting models are further validated through simulations of 3D ARC and oven tests, showing excellent agreement with experimental data and alignment with expected trends.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Cancer Gene Identification through Graph Anomaly Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for identifying cancer genes in recent studies. However, due to the insufficient modeling of the biological information in PPI networks, more faithfully depiction of complex protein interaction patterns for cancer genes within the graph structure remains largely unexplored. This study takes a pioneering step toward bridging biological anomalies in protein interactions caused by cancer genes to statistical graph anomaly. We find a unique graph anomaly exhibited by cancer genes, namely weight heterogeneity, which manifests as significantly higher variance in edge weights of cancer gene nodes within the graph. Additionally, from the spectral perspective, we demonstrate that the weight heterogeneity could lead to the "flattening out" of spectral energy, with a concentration towards the extremes of the spectrum. Building on these insights, we propose the HIerarchical-Perspective Graph Neural Network (HIPGNN) that not only determines spectral energy distribution variations on the spectral perspective, but also perceives detailed protein interaction context on the spatial perspective. Extensive experiments are conducted on two reprocessed datasets STRINGdb and CPDB, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HIPGNN.</description>

      <title>Context Clues: Evaluating Long Context Models for Clinical Prediction Tasks on EHRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks. However, most existing EHR FMs have context windows of &lt;1k tokens. This prevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events. Recent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g., Mamba) offer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been well-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation of the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer context models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction benchmark. For clinical applications, however, model performance alone is insufficient -- robustness to the unique properties of EHR is crucial. Thus, we also evaluate models across three previously underexplored properties of EHR data: (1) the prevalence of "copy-forwarded" diagnoses which creates artificial repetition of tokens within EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals between EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context window; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which makes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying our EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate negatively with model performance, but that longer context models are more robust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the potential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a case study for identifying new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated by domains outside of natural language. We release our models and code at: https://github.com/som-shahlab/long_context_clues</description>

      <title>Generalizable Representation Learning for fMRI-based Neurological Disorder Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive advances achieved using deep learning for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in tasks such as identifying neurological disorders. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Time Series Data Generation for Healthcare Applications: A PCG Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality medical time series data is essential for advancing healthcare diagnostics and safeguarding patient privacy. Specifically, synthesizing realistic phonocardiogram (PCG) signals offers significant potential as a cost-effective and efficient tool for cardiac disease pre-screening. Despite its potential, the synthesis of PCG signals for this specific application received limited attention in research. In this study, we employ and compare three state-of-the-art generative models from different categories - WaveNet, DoppelGANger, and DiffWave - to generate high-quality PCG data. We use data from the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022. Our methods are evaluated using various metrics widely used in the previous literature in the domain of time series data generation, such as mean absolute error and maximum mean discrepancy. Our results demonstrate that the generated PCG data closely resembles the original datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our generative models in producing realistic synthetic PCG data. In our future work, we plan to incorporate this method into a data augmentation pipeline to synthesize abnormal PCG signals with heart murmurs, in order to address the current scarcity of abnormal data. We hope to improve the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic tools in cardiology, enhancing their effectiveness in detecting heart murmurs.</description>

      <title>DCC: Differentiable Cardinality Constraints for Partial Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Index tracking is a popular passive investment strategy aimed at optimizing portfolios, but fully replicating an index can lead to high transaction costs. To address this, partial replication have been proposed. However, the cardinality constraint renders the problem non-convex, non-differentiable, and often NP-hard, leading to the use of heuristic or neural network-based methods, which can be non-interpretable or have NP-hard complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Differentiable Cardinality Constraint ($\textbf{DCC}$) for index tracking and introduce a floating-point precision-aware method ($\textbf{DCC}_{fpp}$) to address implementation issues. We theoretically prove our methods calculate cardinality accurately and enforce actual cardinality with polynomial time complexity. We propose the range of the hyperparameter $a$ ensures that $\textbf{DCC}_{fpp}$ has no error in real implementations, based on theoretical proof and experiment. Our method applied to mathematical method outperforms baseline methods across various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the identified hyperparameter $a$.</description>

      <title>Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.</description>

      <title>Three-Class Text Sentiment Analysis Based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in public opinion monitoring, market research, and beyond. This paper introduces a three-class sentiment classification method for Weibo comments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to discern positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. LSTM, as a deep learning model, excels at capturing long-distance dependencies in text data, providing significant advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. Through preprocessing and feature extraction from Weibo comment texts, our LSTM model achieves precise sentiment prediction. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% and an F1 score of 98.28%, notably outperforming conventional models and other deep learning methods. This underscores the effectiveness of LSTM in capturing nuanced sentiment information within text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Despite its strengths, the LSTM model faces challenges such as high computational complexity and slower processing times for lengthy texts. Moreover, complex emotional expressions like sarcasm and humor pose additional difficulties. Future work could explore combining pre-trained models or advancing feature engineering techniques to further improve both accuracy and practicality. Overall, this study provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis on Weibo comments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cardiovascular Simulations for In-Vivo Prediction of Cardiac Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-body hemodynamics simulators, which model blood flow and pressure waveforms as functions of physiological parameters, are now essential tools for studying cardiovascular systems. However, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping observations (e.g., arterial pressure waveforms at specific locations in the arterial network) back to plausible physiological parameters remains challenging. Leveraging recent advances in simulation-based inference, we cast this problem as statistical inference by training an amortized neural posterior estimator on a newly built large dataset of cardiac simulations that we publicly release. To better align simulated data with real-world measurements, we incorporate stochastic elements modeling exogenous effects. The proposed framework can further integrate in-vivo data sources to refine its predictive capabilities on real-world data. In silico, we demonstrate that the proposed framework enables finely quantifying uncertainty associated with individual measurements, allowing trustworthy prediction of four biomarkers of clinical interest--namely Heart Rate, Cardiac Output, Systemic Vascular Resistance, and Left Ventricular Ejection Time--from arterial pressure waveforms and photoplethysmograms. Furthermore, we validate the framework in vivo, where our method accurately captures temporal trends in CO and SVR monitoring on the VitalDB dataset. Finally, the predictive error made by the model monotonically increases with the predicted uncertainty, thereby directly supporting the automatic rejection of unusable measurements.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</description>
