      <title>OpenAIs HealthBench in Action: Evaluating an LLM-Based Medical Assistant on Realistic Clinical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of 0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support assistant.</description>

      <title>Treasure Hunt in Anonymous Graphs with Quantum Pebbles by Oblivious Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs using oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum information. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable, and edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on stationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search. However, this classical approach is constrained by limited information transmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not sufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of quantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically emit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to the next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct path by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy enables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$ quantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the starting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log 1/\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success probability in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ where $\delta = \cos^2(\frac{\pi}{2\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a guidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum pebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do so with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Event Detection and Classification for Long Range Sensing of Elephants Using Seismic Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments. Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.</description>

      <title>Programmable Quantum Matter: Heralding Large Cluster States in Driven Inhomogeneous Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom-like emitters in solids are promising platforms for quantum sensing and information processing, but inhomogeneities in the emitter fine structure complicate quantum control. We present a framework that leverages this diversity to reduce the resources for generating optically heralded spin cluster states across $N_q$ emitters from the conventional order $O(N_q)$ to $O(1)$ in ensembles of $N_q \sim 10$-$100$. An optimized pulse sequence simultaneously corrects pulse-length and detuning errors, achieving single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ for errors (normalized relative to the Rabi drive strength) up to 0.3, while maintaining fidelities above $99\%$ for errors as large as 0.4. Applied as a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling protocol to the dominant noise spectrum of silicon-vacancy centers in diamond, it enhances ensemble coherence times by over $7\times$ compared to interleaved bang-bang based CPMG. For state-of-the-art dilution refrigerators, global resonant optimal decoupling across $N_q$ spins sharply reduces heating, addressing the trade-off between the spin coherence and scaling to $N_q \gg 1$. We further introduce a modified single-photon entanglement protocol with an efficient algorithm for deterministic entanglement compilation. Depending on the decoupling time window, our method yields order $O(10^2$-$10^4)$ more entanglement links than bang-bang sequences, with theoretical guarantees of order $\Omega(N_q)$ unique links, improvable by control tuning. Together, these techniques provide scalable tools - including global control, phase denoising, remote entanglement, and compilation - for robust quantum computing architectures with heterogeneous spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>TraceLLM: Security Diagnosis Through Traces and Smart Contracts in Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code, proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover, across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability.</description>

      <title>KIRETT: Knowledge-Graph-Based Smart Treatment Assistant for Intelligent Rescue Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the situation.</description>
