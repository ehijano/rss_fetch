      <title>Higher Witt Groups for 2-Categories I: Centralizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate monoidal, braided, sylleptic centralizers of monoidal, braided, sylleptic 2-functors. We specifically focus on multifusion 2-categories and show that monoidal, braided, sylleptic centralizers are multifusion again, via studying the corresponding enveloping algebras. We provide a characterization of the non-degeneracy condition for monoidal, braided, and sylleptic fusion 2-categories, via vanishing of their centers. Applying Double Centralizer Theorems, we establish the relationship between monoidal, braided, symmetric local modules and free modules. In particular, we obtain factorization properties of non-degenerate monoidal, braided, and sylleptic fusion 2-categories. Main results in this article will be used to study higher Witt equivalences of non-degenerate monoidal, braided, sylleptic 2-categories in the sequential articles.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>

Abstract: We develop a unified theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. We show that condensing a $k$-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an $n$+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ amounts to a $k$-step process. In the first step, we condense $A$ along one of the transversal directions, thus obtaining a $(k-1)$-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which can be further condensed as the second step, so on and so forth. In the $k$-th step, condensing $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction defines a phase transition to a new phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$. Mathematically, a $k$-codimensional defect $A$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. In this case, $\Sigma A$ is naturally a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra, thus it can be further condensed. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ consists of all deconfined topological defects in $\mathsf C^{n+1}$. A $k$-codimensional topological defect is deconfined if and only if it is equipped with a $k$-dimensional $A$-action, which defines an $E_k$-module over $A$. When $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same condensation can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ is determined by the category of $E_2$-modules over $\Sigma^{k-2}A$. When $n=2$, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. The proofs of the most mathematical results will appear in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss some generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our condensation theory such as higher Morita theory, factorization homology and the condensation theory of non-topological defects.</description>

      <title>On t-structures adjacent and orthogonal to weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $t$-structures (on triangulated categories) that are closely related to weight structures.
  A $t$-structure couple $t=(C_{t\le 0},C_{t\ge 0})$ is said to be adjacent to a weight structure $w=(C_{w\le 0}, C_{w\ge 0})$ if $C_{t\ge 0}=C_{w\ge 0}$.
  For a category $C$ that satisfies the Brown representability property we prove that $t$ that is adjacent to $w$ exists if and only if $w$ is smashing (that is, "respects C-coproducts"). The heart $Ht$ of this $t$ is the category of those functors $Hw^{op}\to Ab$ that respect products (here $Hw$ is the heart of $w$); the result has important applications.
  We prove several more statements on constructing $t$-structures starting from weight structures; we look for a strictly orthogonal $t$-structure $t$ on some $C'$ (where $C,C'$ are triangulated subcategories of a common $D$) such that $C'_{t\le 0}$ (resp. $C'_{t\ge 0}$) is characterized by the vanishing of morphisms from $C_{w\ge 1}$ (resp. $C_{w\le -1}$). Some of these results generalize properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions proved in the previous paper, and can be applied to various derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$ that is projective over an affine noetherian one. We also study hearts of orthogonal $t$-structures and their restrictions, and prove some statements on "reconstructing" weight structures from orthogonal $t$-structures.</description>

      <title>Two-sided cartesian fibrations of synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Riehl-Shulman's synthetic $(\infty,1)$-category theory, we present a theory of two-sided cartesian fibrations. Central results are several characterizations of the two-sidedness condition \`{a} la Chevalley, Gray, Street, and Riehl-Verity, a two-sided Yoneda Lemma, as well as the proof of several closure properties.
  Along the way, we also define and investigate a notion of fibered or sliced fibration which is used later to develop the two-sided case in a modular fashion. We also briefly discuss discrete two-sided cartesian fibrations in this setting, corresponding to $(\infty,1)$-distributors.
  The systematics of our definitions and results closely follows Riehl-Verity's $\infty$-cosmos theory, but formulated internally to Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory. All the constructions and proofs in this framework are by design invariant under homotopy equivalence. Semantically, the synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories correspond to internal $(\infty,1)$-categories implemented as Rezk objects in an arbitrary given $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <title>Group actions on monoidal triangulated categories and Balmer spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a left or right rigid monoidal triangulated category ${\mathbf K}$ which has a Noetherian Balmer spectrum. We prove that the Balmer spectrum of the crossed product category of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals of ${\mathbf K}$, give a concrete description of this space, and classify the $G$-invariant thick ideals of ${\mathbf K}$. Under some additional technical conditions, we prove that the Balmer spectrum of the equivariantization of ${\mathbf K}$ by $G$ is also homeomorphic to the space of $G$-prime ideals. Examples of stable categories of finite tensor categories and perfect derived categories of coherent sheaves on Noetherian schemes are used to illustrate the theory.</description>
