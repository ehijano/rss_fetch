      <title>3-dimensional charged black holes in $f({Q})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within the framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity scalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and uncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under which these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a GR counterpart, and thus arising purely from the
  higher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore the geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of multiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR. Additionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal stability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective potentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic non-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical gravitational impulse wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of gravitational waves as explosion and implosion waves as predicted by Weber and Wheeler [{\it Rev. Mod. Phys. {\bf 29} 509 (1957)}] in Einstein and Rosen spacetime, has recently been confirmed following observations by the LIGO-VIRGO scientific team [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 116 } 061102 (2016)}] resulting from the collision of two massive black holes. In this dynamics, we explore a new possibility in the construction of gravitational waves like explosion and implosion waves, the special case of Jordan and Ehlers spacetime, by studying the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations. For this purpose, we use the inverse scattering method of Pomeransky in association with the method of Piran et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. D {\bf 32} 3101 (1985)}] by solving the Einstein field equations in combination with the specific metric derived from Jordan and Ehlers in order to obtain a two-soliton solution with complex conjugate poles that we assimilate to the gravitational wave. Consequently, under certain conditions, we obtain the Einstein and Rosen waves and the Chandrasekhar transcendental waves.</description>

      <title>Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a non-trivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</description>

      <title>Nethotrons: exploring the possibility of measuring relativistic spin precessions, from Earth's satellites to the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By ``nethotrons'', from the ancient Greek verb for to ``spin'', it is meant here a natural or artificial rotating object, like a pulsar or an artificial satellite, whose rotational axis is cumulatively displaced by the post-Newtonian static (gravitoelectric) and stationary (gravitomagnetic) components of the gravitational field of some massive body around which it freely moves. Until now, both relativistic effects have been measured only by the dedicated space-based mission Gravity Probe B in the terrestrial environment. It detected the gravitoelectric de Sitter and gravitomagnetic Pugh-Schiff spin precessions of four superconducting gyroscopes accumulated in a year after about 50 years from conception to completion of data analysis at a cost of 750 million dollars to $0.3$ and $19$ per cent accuracy, respectively. The perspectives to measure them also with long-lived Earth's laser-ranged geodetic satellites, like those of the LAGEOS family or possibly one or more of them to be built specifically from scratch, and pulsars orbiting the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre, yet to be discovered, are preliminarily investigated. The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B is examined as well.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Horizon Segments and Spacetime Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a space-time $(\mathscr{M}, g_{ab})$ admitting a dynamical horizon segment (DHS) $\mathscr{H}$, we show that there are stringent constraints on the Killing fields $\xi^a$ that $g_{ab}$ can admit in a neighborhood of $\mathscr{H}$: Generically, $\xi^a$ can only be a rotational Killing field which, furthermore, leaves each marginally trapped 2-sphere cross-section $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}$ invariant. Finally, if $\xi^a$ happens to be hypersurface orthogonal near $\mathscr{H}$, then, not only the angular momentum but also all spin multipoles vanish on every $\mathcal{S}$; the entire spin structure of these DHSs is indistinguishable from that of spherically symmetric DHSs!</description>

      <title>On the Earth's tidal perturbations. II. LARES 2 satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-ranging satellites have proved their efficiency in high precision testing of General Relativity and constraining modified gravity theories proposed to explain the dark sector and the cosmological tensions. The LARES 2 satellite launched in 2022, is currently providing improved information regarding the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity, as well as the geodesy, thus essentially complementing the data of already existing laser-ranging satellites. The proper knowledge of the Earth's tidal perturbation modes is essential for accurately extracting the sought frame-dragging signal. We present the results of computation of 110 significant modes in Doodson number classification for the parameters of LARES 2 satellite, continuing our previous study on those obtained for the LARES satellite.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of CPT-odd Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the CPT-violating (CPTV) Maxwell equations in curved spacetime using the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. We obtain a semi-analytical solution to the Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime under the assumption that the CPT-odd $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ term exhibits spherical symmetry in the Schwarzschild background. Retaining only terms up to linear order in the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ coefficient, we obtain perturbative solutions by treating the solutions of the Lorentz-invariant Maxwell equations as the zeroth-order approximation and incorporating the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ terms as an additional source term alongside the external charge current. Each resulting NP scalar field can be factorized into two components: the radial component is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, while the angular component is described by spin-weighted spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Variation in the size of the Photon Sphere and Black Hole Shadow in the Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.</description>

      <title>Constraining quadrupole deformations with relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two general relativistic effects - namely, the Shirokov and Shapiro effects - within the framework of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime ($q$-metric), which generalizes the Schwarzschild solution by incorporating a quadrupole moment. By analyzing the geodesic deviation equations, we explore the oscillatory motion of test particles and demonstrate how the source's quadrupole parameter influences the Shirokov effect. Furthermore, we derive an expression for the Shapiro time delay in this deformed spacetime and examine the quadrupole moment's impact on the gravitational time delay experienced by radio waves propagating near a massive object. The first-order approximation reveals a pronounced effect of the quadrupole parameter on the time delay, in contrast to similar recent analyses. These findings deepen our understanding of how deviations from spherical symmetry influence gravitational phenomena, with potential implications for the study of compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and naked singularities or ''black hole mimickers'' that exhibit significant multipolar structures.</description>

      <title>On the use and interpretation of signal-model indistinguishability measures for gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference ("mismatch") between two gravitational-wave (GW) signals is often used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which they will be distinguishable in a measurement or, alternatively, when the errors in a signal model will lead to biased measurements. It is well known that the standard approach to calculate this "indistinguishability SNR" is too conservative: a model may fail the criterion at a given SNR, but not necessarily incur a biased measurement of any individual parameters. This problem can be solved by taking into account errors orthogonal to the model space (which therefore do not induce a bias), and calculating indistinguishability SNRs for individual parameters, rather than the full $N$-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate this approach with the simple example of aligned-spin binary-black-hole signals, and calculate accurate estimates of the SNR at which each parameter measurement will be biased. In general biases occur at much higher SNRs than predicted from the standard mismatch calculation. Which parameters are most easily biased depends sensitively on the details of a given waveform model, and the location in parameter space, and in some cases the bias SNR is as high as the conservative estimate. We also illustrate how the parameter bias SNR can be used to robustly specify waveform accuracy requirements for future detectors.</description>

      <title>Tensor perturbations in higher derivative gravity theories in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tensor perturbations of the ghost-free generic non-local gravity theory constructed infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we present, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>HBAR entropy of Infalling Atoms into a GUP-corrected Schwarzschild Black Hole and equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by a two-level atom freely falling into a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP)-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We derive analytic expressions for the atom's excitation probability with simultaneous emission of a scalar quantum and observe that it satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle when compared to the excitation probability induced by a uniformly accelerating mirror, motivated by studies [10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.071301] and [10.1073/pnas.1807703115]. We further demonstrate that this equivalence persists for a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Adopting an open-quantum-system framework, we then compute the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for the GUP-corrected spacetime and find that it reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, supplemented by universal logarithmic and inverse-area corrections characteristic of GUP effects. These results underline the robustness of thermal radiation processes near horizons and the universality of entropy corrections in quantum-improved black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and entropy uncertainty in black hole quantum atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of Hawking radiation induced by the quantum atmosphere beyond the event horizon, by considering two detectors in Schwarzschild spacetime with the parameterized Hartle-Hawking temperature. \textcolor{black}{We explicitly study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and found that its characteristics are closely correlated with Hawking quantum radiation beyond the event horizon. Namely, its minimal value corresponds to the peak of Hawking radiation.} By virtue of the mutual information, we demonstrate the complementary relationship of the information distribution in the black hole. In addition, we detailedly discuss the influence of distance from the center of black hole to particle, radius of event horizon and Hartle-Hawking constant on the entropy uncertainty in the current scenario, and the results interestingly show that there exists an opposite correlation between the entanglement and the entropy uncertainty. It is believed that our observation could provide a new perspective for understanding the black hole information paradox and black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences. Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes. These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations, thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gauges for quadratic gravity: the extended transverse gauge and the energy-momentum tensor of the massive spin-2 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 4D Einstein-Hilbert action extension based on the square of the curvature tensors. Analyses of gauge and perturbation modes are often done considering the Teyssandier gauge condition. Although this approach can be useful for other higher-order extensions of quadratic gravity, a generalized transverse (or Lorentz) gauge is clear and sufficient for the present case, as explained here. We provide a detailed analysis of the generalized transverse gauge condition, its residual gauge symmetry, the physical modes, the induced energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the massive spin-2 mode (which is gauge-dependent), and a comparison with the Teyssandier gauge. The derivation is valid for any EMT. We also compare the induced EMT in quadratic gravity with the massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli EMT, which is different from the previous cases. The comparison is further developed by considering a spherical isothermal sphere, which works as an approximation to virialized spherical systems.</description>

      <title>Analogous supercritical crossovers in black holes and water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the supercritical crossovers for black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical regime beyond the critical point, where small and large black holes are indistinguishable from the conventional viewpoint. We establish a refined supercritical phase diagram that comprehensively characterizes small, large, and indistinguishable black hole phases, whose boundaries are defined by two supercritical crossover lines. The universal scaling laws of the two crossover lines are fully verified using black hole thermodynamics in both the standard consideration and the extended thermodynamic phase space by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. Remarkable analogies are observed when the supercritical phase diagrams of the two frameworks of black holes are compared to those corresponding to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The present study can be extended to a variety of more complicated black hole backgrounds and provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes and echoes of generalized black hole bounces and their correspondence with shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a family of generalized black bounces interpolating between regular black holes and traversable wormhole solutions according to a single extra parameter $a$. Firstly, working with a generic spherically symmetric space-time with arbitrary radial function and an anisotropic fluid matter source, the general equations for the gravitational waves are obtained. Then, we focus on such particular space-time metric and use the time-domain method to find the evolution of the QNMs with respect to the parameter $a$, finding larger frequencies and damped modes as $a$ grows. Furthermore we find that, for a gap in the values of $a$ for which no horizon is present but several photon spheres are, echoes are produced. Such echoes, which come from trapped modes in the potential well that are eventually leaked off for higher frequencies, appear as repetitions of the original wave but with modulated amplitude and decreased frequencies, and study their evolution with $a$. In addition, at the light of the correspondence recently discussed in the literature between QNMs and black hole imaging, we discuss the relation of the features of such echoes with those features (photon rings and shadows) of optical images from thin accretion disks. Despite working with simplified models and settings, our analysis provides useful insights on the usefulness of the correspondence for both gravitational waves and shadows.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational corrections at third-order curvature, acoustic analog black holes and their quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes for bosonic (scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational) and fermionic field perturbations, radiated from black holes that carry quantum gravitational corrections at third order in the curvature to the Schwarzschild solution, are scrutinized from the propagation of analog transonic sound waves across a de Laval nozzle. The thermodynamic variables, the nozzle geometry, the Mach number, and the thrust coefficient are computed as functions of the parameter driving the effective action for quantum gravity containing a dimension-six local operator beyond general relativity. The quasinormal modes for quantum gravitational corrected analog black holes are also determined for higher overtones, yielding a more precise description of the quantum-corrected ringdown process and the gravitational waveform way before the fundamental mode sets in.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit misalignment and residual eccentricity are evidence that neutron star-black hole mergers form through triple star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}&gt;0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}&lt;0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} &gt; 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}&gt;10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point with neutron-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>EFT Corrections to Charged Black Hole Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of higher-derivative corrections from Effective Field Theory on the quasinormal mode spectrum of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. While previous work has explored corrections to Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes - typically using small-rotation approximations - a comprehensive analysis near extremality remains lacking. We focus on Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes as a tractable model admitting an extremal limit, enabling investigation of the effect of these corrections on the so-called zero damped modes, which dominate in this regime. Specifically, we derive a corrected Moncrief equation governing quasinormal modes and present both analytic and numerical results for the corrected frequencies. This work also offers the first explicit test of the recently proposed "Quasinormal Mode Causality" bound arXiv:2401.05524, which constrains Effective Field Theory coefficients by requiring that quasinormal mode lifetimes do not increase measurably under ultraviolet-complete Effective Field Theory corrections. Using Standard Model contributions - particularly those arising from integrating out the electron - we verify that this bound holds. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between Effective Field Theory, extremal black hole dynamics, and causality in gravitational theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bursts from the very early universe may lead to a detectable signal via the production of positrons, whose annihilation gives an observable X-ray signal. Using the absorption parameters for the annihilation photons of 511 keV, it is found that observable photons would originate at a red-shift around $z\approx$ 200-300, resulting in soft X-rays of energy $\sim$ 2-3 keV at present. Positrons are expected to be absent at these times or red-shifts in the standard picture of the early universe. Detection of the X-rays would thus provide dramatic support for the hypothesis of the bursts, explosive events at very early times. We urge the search for such a signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the ``complexity equals anything" proposal with codimension-one and codimension-zero gravitational observables for multi-horizon black holes, using the Bardeen-AdS class black hole as an example. In particular, we compare the results with the ``complexity equals volume" (CV) proposal and find that the ``complexity equals anything" ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{gen}}$) enables the probing of a more complete black hole interior, that is, all spacetime regions where the blackening factor $f(r)&lt;0$. This is the advantage brought by the flexibility of this holographic complexity conjecture. In addition, we compute the complexity derived from various geometric quantities and show that these constructions can effectively differentiate the distinct interior regions of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Carroll black holes and in particular whether or not one could find a Carrollian analogue of a rotating black hole spacetime. Here we show that every stationary and axisymmetric solution (and thence also a black hole) of Carrollian general relativity in any number of $d\geq 3$ dimensions is necessarily also static. Using this result, we construct a unique stationary and axisymmetric black hole in three dimensions - a static Carroll BTZ black hole. At the same time, we find a Carrollian analogue of an accelerating black hole, showing that Schwarzschild is not the only possible stationary and axisymmetric Carroll black hole in four dimensions. A generalization of the no go theorem to include Maxwell, dilatonic, and axionic matter fields is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) projects have reported various lines of evidence suggesting the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background in their data. One key line of evidence involves a detection statistic sensitive to inter-pulsar correlations, such as those induced by GWs. A $p$-value is then calculated to assess how unlikely it is for the observed signal to arise under the null hypothesis $H_0$, purely by chance. However, PTAs cannot empirically draw samples from $H_0$. As a workaround, various techniques are used in the literature to approximate $p$-values under $H_0$. One such technique, which has been heralded as a model-independent method, is the use of ``scrambling'' transformations that modify the data to cancel out pulsar correlations, thereby simulating realizations from $H_0$. In this work, scrambling methods and the detection statistic are investigated from first principles. The $p$-value methodology that is discussed is general, but the discussions regarding a specific detection statistic apply to the detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves with PTAs. All methods in the literature to calculate $p$-values for such a detection statistic are rigorously analyzed, and many analytical expressions are derived. All this leads to the conclusion that scrambling methods are \emph{not} model-independent and thus not completely empirical. Rigorous Bayesian and Frequentist $p$-value calculation methods are advocated, the evaluation of which depend on the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution. This view is consistent with the posterior predictive $p$-value approach that is already in the literature. Efficient expressions are derived to evaluate the generalized $\chi^2$ distribution of the detection statistic on real data. It is highlighted that no Frequentist $p$-values have been calculated correctly in the PTA literature to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Gromov's celebrated reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian geometry. Alongside this result, we introduce and study a natural concept of isomorphy of normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces. We outline applications to the spacetime reconstruction problem from causal set theory. Lastly, we propose three notions of convergence of (isomorphism classes of) normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces, for which we prove several fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Mode stability for the Teukolsky equations on Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there are no non-stationary (with respect to the Hawking vectorfield) real mode solutions to the Teukolsky equations on all $(3+1)$-dimensional subextremal Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We further prove that stationary solutions do not exist if the black hole parameters satisfy the Hawking-Reall bound and $\left|a\sqrt{-\Lambda}\right|&lt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{20}$. We conclude with the statement of mode stability which preludes boundedness and decay estimates for general solutions which will be proven in a separate paper. Our boundary conditions are the standard ones which follow from fixing the conformal class of the metric at infinity and lead to a coupling of the two Teukolsky equations. The proof relies on combining the Teukolsky-Starobinsky identities with the coupled boundary conditions. In the stationary case the proof exploits elliptic estimates which fail if the Hawking-Reall bound is violated. This is consistent with the superradiant instabilities expected in that regime.</description>

Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves cause freely falling spinning objects to precess, resulting in a net orientation change called gyroscopic memory. In this paper, we will consider isolated gravitational sources in the post-Newtonian framework and compute the gyroscopic precession and memory at leading post-Newtonian (PN) orders. We compare two competing contributions: the spin memory and the nonlinear helicity flux. At the level of the precession rate, the former is a 2PN oscillatory effect, while the latter is a 4PN adiabatic effect. However, the gyroscopic memory involves a time integration, which enhances subleading adiabatic effects by the fifth power of the velocity of light, leading to a 1.5PN memory effect. We explicitly compute the leading effects for a quasi-circular binary system and obtain the angular dependence of the memory on the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of Einstein-Aether Gravity from Barrow Agegraphic and New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy models: Examinations and Observational Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation exploring the theoretical framework of Einstein-Aether gravity theory when combined with two modified cosmological paradigms: the Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (BADE) and its newer variant, the New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (NBADE). Our study focuses on reconstructing the functional form of the Einstein-Aether Lagrangian component $F(K)$ from these phenomenological dark energy models. Model parameters are constrained using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach based on multiple datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon+SH0ES compilation. Using best-fit parameters, we analyze various cosmological diagnostics: Hubble and deceleration parameter evolution, dark energy equation of state $\omega_{DE}$, density parameter trajectories, $\omega'_{DE}$--$\omega_{DE}$ phase space behavior, statefinder diagnostics $(r,s^*)$ and $(r,q)$, and Om(z) trajectories. Both models exhibit late-time acceleration, with the dark energy sector showing a quintessence-like nature in the current epoch and evolving toward a phantom regime in the future. Stability analysis based on the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ highlights partial epoch-dependent stability. While our results demonstrate reasonable agreement with observational data and reveal physically plausible dynamics, the models do not yet offer a fundamentally superior alternative to other dark energy reconstructions. Nonetheless, their behavior under modified entropy assumptions and their flexibility in dynamical diagnostics provide a useful framework for probing non-standard extensions of Einstein-Aether gravity and dark energy phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to Albert Einstein, gravitation is analogous to an optical medium. Building on this idea, various definitions of the gradient-index (GRIN) medium representing curved spacetime have been proposed; often, these approaches demand advanced knowledge of General Relativity (GR) and its associated mathematical methods. This paper introduces an alternative approach for generating the form of GRIN media that reproduces the exact behavior of photon trajectories in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole or about the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole. Our approach is based on Noether's theorem that leads to the optical Fermat principle, leveraging the system's symmetry, resulting in an unrestricted and robust method for finding GRIN media in a flat spacetime that reproduces the behavior of null geodesics in Schwarzschild-like spacetimes, employing only photon trajectories as input. This approach is also valid for massive particles and provides a complementary understanding of GR. For this reason, the method is applied to generate the GRIN medium from the S2 star's trajectory around SgrA*, demonstrating that sufficient precision can be achieved to reproduce the orbit's subtle apsidal precession.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black strings in extended phase space, in which the cosmological constant is interpreted as thermodynamic pressure and the thermodynamic volume is defined as its conjugate. We find the thermodynamic volume, the internal energy, and the Smarr law. We study the thermal stability and show that some of the solutions have positive specific heat, which makes them thermodynamically stable. We find, for the first time, there is a critical point for charged solutions which occurs at the point of divergence of specific heat at constant pressure. This supports the existence of a second-order phase transition analogous to the liquid-gas critical point in Van der Waals fluids. We also study the maximal efficiency of a Penrose process and find that an extremal rotating black string can have an efficiency of up to 50%. We also find the equation of state for uncharged solutions. By comparing with the liquid-gas system, we observe that there is not a critical behavior to coincide with those of the Van der Waals system.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algebraic framework was introduced in our previous works to address the covariance issue in spherically symmetric effective quantum gravity. This paper extends the framework to the electro-vacuum case with a cosmological constant. After analyzing the notion of covariance in the classical theory, we propose an effective Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic field. The effective Hamiltonian together with the effective Hamiltonian constraint of gravity determines an effective dynamical model of gravity coupled to electromagnetic. The resulting model is covariant with respect to both the effective metric and the effective vector potential. By solving the equations of motion derived from the effective Hamiltonian constraint, we obtain several quantum-corrected solutions. Notably, some of these solutions reveal quantum gravity effects manifesting not only in spacetime metrics but also in the electromagnetic field. Finally, the covariance of coupling models with general matter fields is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that $f(Q)$ cosmology with a non-trivial connection, namely the Connection II of the literature, is dynamically equivalent with a quintom-like model. In particular, we show that the scalar field arising from the non-linear $f(Q)$ form, and the scalar field associated to the non-trivial connection, are combined to provide one canonical and one phantom field in the minisuperspace Lagrangian. Hence, the combination of two well-behaved fields appears effectively as a phantom field. This is fundamentally different from the usual approach in phantom and quintom cosmology, in which the phantom field is introduced ad hoc, and thus it may open a new way to handle the phantom fields, namely as effective realizations of the connection-related canonical fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the observational properties of a spherically symmetric, static regular black hole within the framework of asymptotic safety (AS) as proposed by Bonanno et al. The metric resembles the Schwarzschild solution in the classical limit. The departure from Schwarzschild at small scales is controlled by a single free parameter related to the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff of the theory. We investigated null and time-like geodesics around the AS metric, including circular orbits, photon rings and lensing effects. In particular we focused on the optical properties of thin accretion disks in the equatorial plane of the object and compared them with those of accretion disks in the Schwarzschild metric. We found that the radiation flux, luminosity, and efficiency of the accretion disk increase with the value of the free parameter. Using a spacetime generic open-source relativistic ray-tracing code, we simulate the K$\alpha$ iron line profiles emitted by the disk and analyze their deviation from that of the Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>

      <title>Stairway to equilibrium entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <title>A Double-Sine-Gordon Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A solitonic model of the early universe is introduced by employing the Double-Sine-Gordon (DSG) potential. The model predicts the appropriate number of e-foldings ($N_e$) required for favored inflation and is an advantage for the model in addressing the flatness, horizon, and magnetic monopole problems. Compatibility of the model with observations, including the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)} paves the way to estimate the model's free parameters. The results generate acceptable and proper values for the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)}. Correspondingly, a consistent description of the reheating era is obtained, yielding positive reheating number of e-foldings ($N_{\mathrm{reh}}$) and reheating final temperature ($T_{\mathrm{reh}}$) from $10^{-2}$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. Overall, the model seems viable at the inflationary and reheating eras.</description>

      <title>Gravity from AKSZ-Manin theories in two, three, and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeomorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular AKSZ theory.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effective action and particle creation in $D$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation rate in the context of quantum fields in curved spacetimes, by evaluating the imaginary part of the effective action up to second order in the curvatures. For arbitrary metrics in dimensions $D\geq4$, we express the vacuum persistence amplitude in terms of the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor, showing that, up to their second power, no particle creation occurs for conformal fields in conformally flat spacetimes. We pinpoint an analogy with the electromagnetic pair creation, by writing the squared Weyl tensor invariant in terms of its electric and magnetic parts. In addition, we present an alternative expression for the imaginary part of the effective action employing the Cotton tensor. This is particularly useful in $D=3$, where the Weyl tensor trivially vanishes and the Cotton tensor is related to conformal flatness. Finally, we highlight the importance of the threshold for particle creation, a point that has been overlooked in some recent studies.</description>

      <title>New constraints on interacting dark energy from DESI DR2 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In its second data release (DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) publicly released measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from over 13.1 million galaxies and 1.6 million quasars, covering the redshift range $0.295 \leq z \leq 2.330$. In this work, we investigate the impact of this new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by non-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), commonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two frameworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching Interacting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both scenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis, ensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main results indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it to moderate tension approximately $2.7\sigma$. The IDE model shows compatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys, while the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with alternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model, we derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest constraints to date through geometric measurements. This highlights the crucial role that supernova samples can play in refining these constraints. For the S-IDE model, we find mild evidence (over $2\sigma$) for a non-zero coupling, once the PantheonPlus dataset calibrated with Cepheid-based magnitude measurements is included in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data as well as $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background, based on both parametric and realistic scalar field evolutions. Although the realistic model does not allow $w&lt;-1$, the parametrizations do allow it. However even if we allow $w&lt;-1$ the data do not enforce phantom crossing. Thus, the phantom crossing is an artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity observables: observation, algebras, and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The questions of describing observables and observation in quantum gravity appear to be centrally important to its physics. A relational approach holds significant promise, and a classification of different types of relational observables (gravitationally dressed, field relational, and more general) is outlined. Plausibly gravitationally dressed observables are particularly closely tied to the fundamental structure of the theory. These may be constructed in the quantum theory to leading order in Newton's constant, and raise important questions about localization of information. Approximate localization is given by a "standard dressing" construction of a "gravitational splitting." It is also argued that such gravitational dressings give a generalization of the crossed product construction, reducing to this and yielding type II von Neumann algebras in special cases. Gravity therefore introduces a significantly more general alteration of the algebraic structure of local quantum field theory, also with apparent connections to holography, but whose implications have not been fully understood. In particular, properties of the algebra of gravitationally dressed observables suggest a possible role for other non-algebraic structure on the Hilbert space for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>
