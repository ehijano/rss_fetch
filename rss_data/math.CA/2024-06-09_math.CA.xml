      <title>${l}^2$ Decoupling for certain degenerate surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to study decoupling inequality for a specific degenerate hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Inspired by the work of Bourgain--Demeter and Li--Zheng, we consider the hypersurface $\mathcal{S}^3_{4}:=\{(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3,\xi^4_1+\xi^4_2+\xi^4_3):0\leq \xi_j\leq1, \text{for}~j=1,2,3\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and study decoupling estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence guarantees for the mean-field dispersion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dispersion process on the complete graph introduced in the recent work \cite{de_dispersion_2023} under the mean-field framework. In contrast to the probabilistic approach taken in \cite{de_dispersion_2023} and many other related works, our focus is on the investigation of the large time behavior of solutions of the associated kinetic mean-field system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We establish various analytical and quantitative convergence results for the long time behaviour of the mean-field system and related numerical illustrations are also provided.</description>

      <title>Bordered and Framed Toeplitz and Hankel Determinants with Applications to Integrable Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bordered and framed Toeplitz/Hankel determinants have the same structure as Toeplitz/Hankel determinants except in small number of matrix rows and/or columns. We review these structured determinants and their connections to orthogonal polynomials, collecting well-known and perhaps less well-known results. We present some applications for these structured determinants to ensembles of non-intersecting paths and the six-vertex model, with an eye towards asymptotic analysis. We also prove some asymptotic formulae for the probability of non-intersection for an ensemble of continuous time random walks for certain choices of starting and ending points as the number of random walkers tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On sharp variational inequalities for oscillatory integral operators of Stein-Wainger type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $n \geq 2$, we establish $L^p(\R^n)$ inequalities for the $r$-variations of Stein-Wainger type oscillatory integral operators with general radial phase functions. These inequalities closely related to Carleson's theorem are sharp, up to endpoints. In particular, when the phase function is chosen as $|t|^\A$ with $\A\in (0,1)$, our results provide an affirmative answer to a question posed in Guo-Roos-Yung (Anal. PDE, 2020). In pursuit of the objective, we use an approach incorporating the method of stationary phase, a square function estimate derived from Seeger's arguments, Stein-Tomas restriction estimates, and a crucial observation enabling the derivation of useful decay estimates near endpoints. Furthermore, we obtain the restricted weak type estimates for endpoints in the specific case of homogeneous phase functions. As an application of these outcomes, we further extend analogous results to a class of ergodic integral operators.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation of Euler's constant using multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new rational approximants of Euler's constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007) and Rivoal (2009). The approximants are given in terms of certain (mixed type) multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the exponential integral. The dual family of multiple orthogonal polynomials leads to new rational approximants of the Gompertz constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007). Our approach is motivated by the fact that we can reformulate Rivoal's construction in terms of type I multiple Laguerre polynomials of the first kind by making use of the underlying Riemann-Hilbert problem. As a consequence, we can drastically simplify Rivoal's approach, which allows us to study the Diophantine and asymptotic properties of the approximants more easily.</description>

      <title>An FIO-based approach to $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation on $2$-step Carnot groups: the case of M\'etivier groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a homogeneous left-invariant sub-Laplacian on a $2$-step Carnot group. We devise a new geometric approach to sharp fixed-time $L^p$-bounds with loss of derivatives for the wave equation driven by $\mathcal{L}$, based on microlocal analysis and highlighting the role of the underlying sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. A major challenge here stems from the fact that, differently from the Riemannian case, the conjugate locus of a point on a sub-Riemannian manifold may cluster at the point itself, thus making it indispensable to deal with caustics even when studying small-time wave propagation.
  Our analysis of the wave propagator on a $2$-step Carnot group allows us to reduce microlocally to two conic regions in frequency space: an anti-FIO region, which seems not amenable to FIO techniques, and an FIO region. For the latter, we construct a parametrix by means of FIOs with complex phase, by adapting a construction from the elliptic setting due to Laptev, Safarov and Vassiliev, which remains valid beyond caustics. A substantial problem arising here is that, after a natural decomposition and scalings, one must deal with the long-time behaviour and control of $L^1$-norms of the corresponding contributions to the wave propagator, a new phenomenon that is specific to sub-elliptic settings.
  For the class of M\'etivier groups, we show how our approach, in combination with a variation of the key method of Seeger, Sogge and Stein for proving $L^p$-estimates for FIOs, yields $L^p$-bounds for the wave equation, which are sharp up to the endpoint regularity. In particular, we extend previously known results for distinguished sub-Laplacians on groups of Heisenberg type, by means of a more general and robust approach. The study of the wave equation on wider classes of $2$-step Carnot groups via this approach will pose further challenges that we plan to address in subsequent works.</description>
