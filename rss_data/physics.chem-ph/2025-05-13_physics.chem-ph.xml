      <title>Simplified, Physically Motivated, and Universally Applicable Range-Separation Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Range-separated hybrid functionals with ``ionization energy'' and/or ``optimal tuning'' of the screening parameter have proven to be among the most practical and accurate approaches for describing excited-state properties across a wide range of systems, including condensed matter. However, this method typically requires multiple self-consistent calculations and can become computationally expensive and unstable, particularly for extended systems. In this work, we propose a very simple and efficient alternative approach to determine the screening parameter, based solely on the total electron density of the system and the compressibility sum rule of density functional theory (DFT). This effective screening parameter achieves remarkable accuracy, particularly for charge-transfer excitations, surpassing the performance of previously suggested alternatives. Because it relies only on the electron density, the proposed approach is physically transparent and highly practical to automate DFT calculations in large and complex systems, including bulk solids, where ``tuning'' is not possible.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking distinguishable cluster methods to platinum standard CCSDT(Q) non covalent interaction energies in the A24 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent disagreement between state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods, coupled cluster with single, double and perturbative triples excitations and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo, calls for systematic examination of possible sources of error within both methodological approaches. Coupled cluster theory is systematically improvable toward the exact solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, however very quickly is limited by the computational cost of the calculation. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop low-cost methods that are able to reproduce CC results, beyond the CCSD(T) level of theory. Here, the DC-CCSDT and SVD-DC-CCSDT methods are examined for their fidelity to the CCSDT(Q) correlation interaction energies for the A24 dataset and are shown to outperform CCSDT and CCSD(T). Furthermore, with (T)-based corrections of the SVD approximation the SVD-DC-CCSDT method becomes an accurate and relatively low-cost tool for calculation of previously intractable post-CCSD(T) energies in atomic orbital basis sets of unprecedented size.</description>

      <title>Building-Block Aware Generative Modeling for 3D Crystals of Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion (BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database, BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.</description>

      <title>An excitation matched local correlation approach to excited state specific perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a cubic scaling approach to excited-state-specific second order perturbation theory in which the completeness of a local correlation treatment is carefully matched between the ground and excited state. With this matching, the accuracy of the parent method is maintained even as substantial portions of the correlation energy are neglected. Even when treating a long-range charge transfer excitation, cubic scaling is achieved in systems with as few as ten non-hydrogen atoms. In a test on the influence of an explicit solvent molecule on a long range charge transfer, the approach is qualitatively more accurate than EOM-CCSD and reproduces CC3's excitation energies and excited state potential energy surface to within about 0.1 eV and 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Pipeline for Molecular Property Prediction using ChemXploreML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ChemXploreML, a modular desktop application designed for machine learning-based molecular property prediction. The framework's flexible architecture allows integration of any molecular embedding technique with modern machine learning algorithms, enabling researchers to customize their prediction pipelines without extensive programming expertise. To demonstrate the framework's capabilities, we implement and evaluate two molecular embedding approaches - Mol2Vec and VICGAE (Variance-Invariance-Covariance regularized GRU Auto-Encoder) - combined with state-of-the-art tree-based ensemble methods (Gradient Boosting Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM). Using five fundamental molecular properties as test cases - melting point (MP), boiling point (BP), vapor pressure (VP), critical temperature (CT), and critical pressure (CP) - we validate our framework on a dataset from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. The models achieve excellent performance for well-distributed properties, with R$^2$ values up to 0.93 for critical temperature predictions. Notably, while Mol2Vec embeddings (300 dimensions) delivered slightly higher accuracy, VICGAE embeddings (32 dimensions) exhibited comparable performance yet offered significantly improved computational efficiency. ChemXploreML's modular design facilitates easy integration of new embedding techniques and machine learning algorithms, providing a flexible platform for customized property prediction tasks. The application automates chemical data preprocessing (including UMAP-based exploration of molecular space), model optimization, and performance analysis through an intuitive interface, making sophisticated machine learning techniques accessible while maintaining extensibility for advanced cheminformatics users.</description>

      <title>The Open Molecules 2025 (OMol25) Dataset, Evaluations, and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models hold the promise of transforming atomic simulations by delivering quantum chemical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost. Realization of this potential would enable high-throughout, high-accuracy molecular screening campaigns to explore vast regions of chemical space and facilitate ab initio simulations at sizes and time scales that were previously inaccessible. However, a fundamental challenge to creating ML models that perform well across molecular chemistry is the lack of comprehensive data for training. Despite substantial efforts in data generation, no large-scale molecular dataset exists that combines broad chemical diversity with a high level of accuracy. To address this gap, Meta FAIR introduces Open Molecules 2025 (OMol25), a large-scale dataset composed of more than 100 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the $\omega$B97M-V/def2-TZVPD level of theory, representing billions of CPU core-hours of compute. OMol25 uniquely blends elemental, chemical, and structural diversity including: 83 elements, a wide-range of intra- and intermolecular interactions, explicit solvation, variable charge/spin, conformers, and reactive structures. There are ~83M unique molecular systems in OMol25 covering small molecules, biomolecules, metal complexes, and electrolytes, including structures obtained from existing datasets. OMol25 also greatly expands on the size of systems typically included in DFT datasets, with systems of up to 350 atoms. In addition to the public release of the data, we provide baseline models and a comprehensive set of model evaluations to encourage community engagement in developing the next-generation ML models for molecular chemistry.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation Using WO$_3$ Nanoparticle-Decorated Sodium Niobate Microcubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current work studies the electrocatalytic performance of NaNbO$_3$ microcubes decorated with WO$_3$ nanoparticles on Printex L6 at varying concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% by weight) for H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration aiming for future use in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for organic pollutant degradation H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration was studied using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Electrochemical results revealed an improvement in H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration for the NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C materials compared to that achieved with Printex L6 carbon. Notably, the 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalyst exhibited a higher ring current for oxygen reduction reaction and promoted a 2.1-electron transfer, facilitating a higher rate of H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration through the 2-electron mechanism. Also, enhancing oxygen-containing functional groups has shown the capability to thoroughly adjust characteristics and enhance active sites, increasing H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration. These findings suggest that 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalysts hold promise for in situ hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration.</description>

      <title>Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting fine-tuned open-source large language models (LLMs), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem for AI-enhanced computational chemistry. This intelligent assistant is going to be integrated into the Aitomistic Hub and XACS online computing services, with some functionality already publicly available as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fermionic System Simulation on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A potential approach for demonstrating quantum advantage is using quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems. Quantum algorithms for fermionic system simulation usually involve the Hamiltonian evolution and measurements. However, in the second quantization representation, the number of terms in many fermion-system Hamiltonians, such as molecular Hamiltonians, is substantial, approximately $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$, where $N$ is the number of molecular orbitals. Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ Hamiltonian terms into $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of $N$. Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions. Our approach saves a factor of $N^3$ in the overall time for Hamiltonian evolution and measurements, significantly decreasing the time required for quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon, has attracted significant interest for its electronic and mechanical properties, alongside its compatibility with various substrates. In this study, we investigate the structural and elastic characteristics of silicene using molecular dynamics simulations based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian, calibrated to align with density-functional theory calculations. We focus particularly on the material's elastic properties and mechanical stability, analyzing its behavior under extensive compressive and tensile in-plane stresses and across temperatures up to 1000 K. Key properties examined include in-plane area, Si--Si bond length, atomic mean-square displacements, elastic constants, and 2D compression modulus. Our findings reveal a notable reduction in stiffness elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, and compression modulus with increasing temperature. Additionally, we identify mechanical instabilities in the silicene structure at specific compressive and tensile biaxial stresses, signaling the material's stability limits or spinodal points. At the corresponding spinodal pressures, structural and elastic properties exhibit anomalies or divergences.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of IR-Inactive Modes via Vibrational Polaritons: Insights from Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational polaritons, hybrid light-matter states formed between molecular vibrations and infrared (IR) cavity modes, provide a novel approach for modifying chemical reaction pathways and energy transfer processes. For vibrational polaritons involving condensed-phase molecules, the short polariton lifetime raises debate over whether pumping polaritons may produce different effects on molecules compared to directly exciting the molecules in free space or under weak coupling. Here, for liquid methane under vibrational strong coupling, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that pumping the upper polariton (UP) formed by the asymmetric bending mode of methane can sometimes selectively excite the IR-inactive symmetric bending mode. This finding is validated when the molecular system is described using both empirical force fields and machine-learning potentials, also in qualitative agreement with analytical theory of polariton energy transfer rates based on Fermi's golden rule calculations. Additionally, our study suggests that polariton-induced energy transfer to IR-inactive modes reaches maximal efficiency when the UP has significant contributions from both photons and molecules, underscoring the importance of light-matter hybridization. As IR-inactive vibrational modes are generally inaccessible to direct IR excitation, our study highlights the unique role of polariton formation in selectively controlling IR-inactive vibrations. Since this polariton-induced process occurs after the polariton decays, it may impact IR photochemistry on a timescale longer than the polariton lifetime, as observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Computing Moments for Exact Quantum Dynamics: Application to Arbitrary System-Bath Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general procedure for computing higher-order moments of correlation functions in open quantum systems, extending the scope of our recent work on Memory Kernel Coupling Theory (MKCT) [W. Liu, Y. Su, Y. Wang, and W. Dou, arXiv:2407.01923 (2024)]. This approach is demonstrated for arbitrary system-bath coupling that can be expressed as polynomial, $H_{SB} = \hat{V} (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{q} + \alpha_2 \hat{q}^2+ \dots)$, where we show that the recursive commutators of a system operator obey a universal hierarchy. Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings suggest a promising path toward accurate dynamics for complex open quantum systems.</description>
