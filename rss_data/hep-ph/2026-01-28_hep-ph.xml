      <title>Thermoskyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable and topologically non-trivial field configurations that behave like localized particles. They appear in the chiral effective theory for pions, where they correspond to the baryon states, and might also exist in the electroweak theory, in the presence of certain effective interactions. In this paper, focusing on toy models that capture different limits of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM), we show that skyrmions not classically stable at zero temperature can be stabilized by thermal effects. This result motivates the study of skyrmions in the quantum effective action of the SM, potentially implying the existence of dark matter without new physics.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan Production of New Particles at Fixed-Target Experiments: Heavy Neutral Lepton as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the sensitivity of Drell-Yan production processes from deep inelastic scattering in searches for beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics at fixed-target or beam-bump experiments. We take heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) as a case study, produced from the decay of a light vector boson mediator with mass in the range of $2-20$ GeV, which itself is generated via the Drell-Yan process. The produced HNLs subsequently decay into Standard Model final states. We consider several current and future experiments, including SBND, DarkQuest, DUNE Near Detector (ND), and SHiP. Utilizing $\nu\pi^0$ and $\nu e^+e^-$ final states from HNL decays, we find that the Drell-Yan mechanism provides important contributions and significantly enhances the HNL search sensitivity, owing to the production of energetic final-state particles that are more readily detectable over the expected backgrounds. We find that at $90\%$ C.L. sensitivity, for gauge couplings $g_{X} \sim 10^{-2}\ (10^{-3})$ and kinematically accessible mass range, SBND and DarkQuest can probe the HNL flavor mixing $|U_{\ell}| \sim 3\times 10^{-4}\ (10^{-3})$, whereas DUNE ND and SHiP may extend the sensitivity down to the Type-I Seesaw prediction of $|U_{\ell}| \sim 10^{-5}$. Finally, for our chosen benchmark $|U_{\ell}| = 10^{-3}$ outside of the current experimental constraints, with a fixed mass ratio $m_{Z'}/m_N = 2.1$, and working within the $U(1)_{B-L}$, $U(1)_{B-3L_{\tau}}$, and $U(1)_{B}$ parameter spaces, we find that both SBND and DarkQuest can probe $g_{X} \sim 10^{-3}$, DUNE ND can reach $g_{X} \sim 10^{-4}$, and SHiP can probe down to $g_{X}\sim 5\times 10^{-6}$. Our approach provides a powerful new technique to study HNL production at future fixed-target experiments and can readily be extended to other light BSM particle production within a broader class of dark sector models.</description>

      <title>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part II. Weak instabilities and their resonant behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor instabilities in dense neutrino media trigger exponential growth of flavor waves, yet their nonlinear saturation remains poorly understood. We examine a simple proxy for this effect in the form of a single-wave solution of an axially symmetric fast flavor system. When the angular crossing is shallow and the growth rate of the instability correspondingly small, the flavor wave primarily affects resonant neutrinos that move in phase with it. The evolution of these resonant neutrinos becomes periodic, undergoing cycles of full flavor reversal. They feed power into the unstable wave, and subsequently return to their initial state, draining power back out. This new flavor pendulum captures the dynamics of weak, nearly monochromatic fast flavor instabilities. Since weakly unstable distributions always exhibit a narrow range of unstable wavenumbers, our model likely describes the earliest development of a flavor instability when it first appears. When the instability is not weak, the linear phase of a single-wave excitation does not connect to a regular nonlinear solution, unless the angle distribution consists of only two beams.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading power corrections to unpolarized Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) is a key tool for exploring the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions. While leading-power contributions to the SIDIS cross-section are well established, next-to-leading (NLP) of order $1/Q$ and next-to-next-to-leading power (NNLP) corrections of order $1/Q^2$ to the hadronic tensor have only recently begun to be systematically investigated. These corrections are essential for the reliable phenomenology and interpretation of modern high-precision data. In recent papers by one of the authors, NNLP corrections to Drell-Yan process were derived using rapidity factorization formalism. In the present work we extend this approach to SIDIS and obtain analytic expressions for the unpolarized structure functions. We derive NNLP corrections that include convolutions of unpolarized distributions, $f_1$, with unpolarized fragmentation functions, $D_1$, and Boer-Mulders functions, $h_1^\perp$, with Collins fragmentation functions, $H_1^\perp$. We compare our results with previous formulations, provide numerical studies, confront our predictions with HERMES and COMPASS measurements, and present predictions for future experiments at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>One-loop matching of the LEFT to the QCD gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the complete one-loop matching of the baryon- and lepton-number-conserving low-energy effective field theory (LEFT) to the QCD gradient flow. Using Euclidean conventions and the background-field formulation of the gradient flow, we derive the short-flow-time expansion for the full LEFT operator basis up to mass dimension six. The matching is performed in dimensional regularization in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme, including a systematic treatment of evanescent operators and the finite counterterms required to restore chiral symmetry in the spurion sense. Keeping fully generic flavor structures, we verify the cancellation of spurious chiral-symmetry-violating terms with the known finite symmetry-restoring counterterms. This demonstrates that the gradient flow as a gauge-invariant ultraviolet regulator enables an efficient extraction of both divergent and finite counterterms in addition to the matching contributions. We provide the matching coefficients both before and after field redefinitions that remove redundant operators, as well as power-divergent mixings into lower-dimensional operators. Our results establish a consistent perturbative link between continuum LEFT calculations and gradient-flow-based lattice-QCD matrix elements, enabling precision low-energy phenomenology beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Constraining axial non-standard interactions of neutrinos with long baseline experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to a number of neutrino oscillation and Coherent Elastic neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experiments, the vector Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos have been well studied and constrained. We show that the long-sought-after new physics may hide in the ``axial" non-standard interactions rather than in the vector NSI. We then show how by studying neutral current scattering events in the detectors of long baseline experiments, MINOS, MINOS$+$ and DUNE, the impact of the axial NSI can be discovered.</description>

      <title>Probing Lepton Flavor Violation at the ILC and CLIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation in the $\tau\mu$ sector would be a clear sign of Beyond Standard Model physics. We employ the SMEFT framework to study the process $e^+e^-\to\tau\mu$ at the ILC and CLIC. We find that the $e^+e^-$ beam polarizations achievable at these machines allow us to probe the chirality structure of the SMEFT operators. In addition, the high center of mass energy leads to a substantial increase in sensitivity to the four-fermion operators that rivals, and in some cases, surpasses tau decay projections from Belle-II.</description>

      <title>Part II: Low Energy Galactic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low energy galactic neutrinos in the Milky Way under two fundamentally different descriptions of gravity, showing that neutrinos provide a sensitive probe of gravity underlying nature. If gravity is a quantum interaction, its long range character leads to the formation of an atom like bound neutrino structure. We compute its mass distribution and find that, within a radius 292 kpc, the total mass is only ten to the minus 29 of the galaxy dark matter, ruling it out as a dark matter candidate. Nevertheless, experimental confirmation of this structure would constitute direct evidence for gravity as a quantum force mediated by gravitons. If gravity instead arises from spacetime curvature, neutrinos interact only via the short range weak force and are therefore effectively collisionless. In this regime, neutrinos behave as free classical particles orbiting the galaxy and experience no Fermi pressure. We show that such a population can be sufficiently compact to reproduce the Milky Way rotation curve, making neutrinos viable dark matter candidates. The extremely small neutrino antineutrino annihilation cross section further implies near equilibrium between neutrinos and antineutrinos, potentially addressing the matter antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>

      <title>Analysing Toponium at the LHC using Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider indicate the presence of a top-quark pair bound state near the threshold region. We present a way to reconstruct a toponium state at the $t\bar{t}$ threshold region formed at the Large Hadron Collider using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction. We have considered the Non-Relativistic QCD based toponium model implemented in MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO. The final states considered consist of two b-jets, two oppositely charged leptons, and missing energy that arises from two neutrinos. The goal of the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction is to make use of rules that can help resolve combinatorics ambiguity in preparing the decay tree for a given physics event. Additionally, missing energy coming from two neutrinos needs to be resolved in order to reconstruct the event. We apply four different methods within the RestFrames package and compare the reconstruction results resulting from each of the methods. Due to this method, one can also access kinematic variables in the rest frames belonging to intermediate particle states, providing additional means to discriminate the SM $\ttbar$ background from the toponium signal. We propose using two angular variables to enhance sensitivity to the toponium signal. Our preliminary results indicate that the improvement in sensitivity can be as much as 16\% over the current strategy in the LHC's Run 3 configuration. This method may be useful for gaining additional insight into the physics phenomenology in the $\ttbar$ threshold region.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Chiral Phase Transitions: The Role of Polyakov Loop Kinetics Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied a crucial but often oversimplified ingredient in predicting gravitational-wave signals from QCD-type phase transitions: the kinetic term of the Polyakov loop. For the first time, we derive this term from first principles in finite-temperature pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, incorporating a field-dependent renormalization factor--a calculation we also extend to theories with more colors. Employing this derived kinetic term alongside three commonly-used effective potentials (the Haar-measure, polynomial, and quasi-particle models), we demonstrate that it substantially modifies the predicted GW energy spectrum from confinement transitions by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Based on this, we provide the first complete analysis of the chiral transition within the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) framework, described by the quark condensate. Our results reveal a clear dichotomy: while the Polyakov-loop kinetic term critically shapes GWs from confinement transitions, it has a negligible impact on the dynamics of the chiral transition, which is dominated by fermion condensation effects.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from Galactic Diffuse Synchrotron Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of constraining primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$ through Galactic diffuse synchrotron emissions. Due to Hawking radiation, these types of PBHs are expected to be stable sources of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons with energies below $\mathcal{O}(10\,\mathrm{MeV})$. In many CR propagation models with diffusive re-acceleration characterized by a significant Alfv\'{e}n velocity $V_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{km/s}$, the energies of the evaporated electrons/positrons can be further enhanced to $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{MeV}$ through their scattering with the Galactic random magnetic fields. Consequently, the observation of Galactic synchrotron emissions at frequencies above $\sim 20\,\mathrm{MHz}$ can provide useful constraints on the abundance of PBHs. Using the AMS-02 and Voyager-1 data on the boron-to-carbon nuclei flux ratio, we confirm that a significant Alfv\'{e}n velocity $V_a \sim 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$ is favored in several benchmark diffusive re-acceleration models. We show that, in this scenario, the observed low-frequency synchrotron emissions (from 22 MHz to 1.4 GHz) can provide stringent constraints on PBH abundance. The obtained conservative constraints are stronger than those derived from the Voyager-1 all-electron (electron plus positron) data by more than one order of magnitude for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$, and also stronger than our previous constraints derived from the AMS-02 positron data for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 2\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics and CP Violation in $\nu_\tau n \to \Lambda_c \tau^- (\pi^- \nu_\tau)$ and $\bar\nu_\tau p \to \Lambda \tau^+ (\pi^+ \bar\nu_\tau)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the processes $\nu_\tau n \to \Lambda_c \tau^- (\pi^- \nu_\tau)$ and $\bar\nu_\tau p \to \Lambda \tau^+ (\pi^+ \bar\nu_\tau)$, with particular emphasis on the pion energy and angular distributions, as a possible signal for lepton flavor universality violation, and in general of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as well as a sensitive probe of the $\tau$ polarization vector. We work within an effective low-energy extension of the SM with all dimension-six four-fermion operators. In this framework, complex Wilson coefficients which encode new physics can generate CP-violating contributions. We propose an observable that provides a genuine CP-odd signal due to its sensitivity to particular transverse components of the $\tau$ polarization vector. Namely, we show that the asymmetry in the azimuthal-angle distribution of the pion in the decay $\tau^\pm\to \pi^\pm \nu_\tau$ constitutes a smoking-gun prediction of such a beyond the SM scenario. We estimate the strength of this effect extrapolating nucleon-hyperon form factors recently obtained from lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating signals driven by CP symmetry of order 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP4 3HDM is a curious version of the three-Higgs-doublet model built upon a CP symmetry of order 4 (dubbed CP4). When extended to fermions, CP4 leads to unusually tight correlations between the scalar and Yukawa sectors and induces tree-level flavor changing neutral couplings. Still, viable scenarios exist, in which quark flavor changing signals remain within experimental limits. In this work, we extend CP4 to the lepton sector and investigate whether the lepton-Higgs couplings and lepton flavor violating (LFV) signals can also be kept under control. We consider two classes of LFV processes: tree-level lepton decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson and one-loop radiative decay $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$. For each CP4-invariant lepton Yukawa scenario, we perform a focused Yukawa sector scan that uses physical lepton properties as input and suppresses LFV effects. We identify a promising CP4 3HDM scenario compatible with the present-day experimental constraints, show that it can accommodate the recent CMS hint of a 146 GeV scalar decaying to $e\mu$, and argue that this interpretation can be tested at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Predictions of effective Majorana neutrino mass under radiative corrections to $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is currently one of the key objectives in neutrino physics research. The decay rate of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay depends on the effective Majorana neutrino mass $|\langle m \rangle_{ee}|$. In this work we study the numerical prediction of $|\langle m \rangle_{ee}|$ in the scenario of deviation from the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry due to radiative corrections, as an extension of our earlier work \cite{pegu}. In \cite{pegu}, we consider an exact $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry in the light effective Majorana neutrino mass matrix and in the corresponding lepton mixing matrix as well at the seesaw scale. We choose numerical values of all the mixing parameters and neutrino mass eigenvalues at the seesaw scale as inputs and estimate the values of mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to radiative corrections. We find these low energy predictions consistent with global $3\sigma$ oscillation data. In the present work, we compute the effective Majorana neutrino mass $|\langle m \rangle_{ee}|$ using these low energy values at the electroweak scale. We find that the low energy predictions of $|\langle m \rangle_{ee}|$ are consistent with the latest upper bound $|\langle m \rangle_{ee}|&lt;(0.028-0.122)\ eV$ provided by KamLAND-Zen Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Radiative Dirac neutrino masses and dark matter in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) in which Dirac neutrino masses are generated radiatively at the one-loop level through the exchange of new beyond the SM fields. This framework establishes a direct connection between neutrino mass generation and the dark sector, with the stability of the dark matter ensured by a residual discrete $Z_6$ symmetry arising from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$. We investigate the resulting charged lepton flavor violating processes and dark matter phenomenology, saturating relic observations and direct-detection constraints, and analyze the collider signatures of the dark sector at the Large Hadron Collider and at a future muon collider. We have identified excellent prospects for observing the considered dark matter candidates in these colliders, even with lower integrated luminosities than the proposed one.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of radiation from global strings and the relic axion density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</description>

      <title>Event generation with exponential scaling in multiplicity using AmpliCol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of LHC events is hindered by the rapidly rising cost of evaluating QCD matrix elements with increasing multiplicity. We build on a recently proposed two-step strategy in which unweighted events are first generated using the leading-colour (LC) approximation and then reweighted to full-colour (FC) accuracy, utilising the LC integration efficiency while recovering the exact FC prediction. In this work we extend the method to general Standard Model processes and present AmpliCol, a standalone implementation designed for LHC collisions. We benchmark multi-jet, $t\bar{t}$+jets, $ZZ$+jets, and Drell-Yan+jets production, measuring the time required to obtain a fixed number of unweighted events at FC accuracy. Across all processes, the runtime exhibits a stable exponential scaling with multiplicity, far milder than the factorial growth of conventional matrix-element generators. This demonstrates that the AmpliCol code enables efficient event generation at multiplicities that are otherwise computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Probing EFT breakdown in the tails of $W^+ W^-$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we test clipping effective field theory (EFT) simulations as a method of ensuring EFT validity. The procedure imposes that, at the level of the simulation, the invariant mass of a $W^+W^-$ pair $M_{WW}$ is less than the new physics scale $\Lambda$. We compare this to two other methods, comparison bin by bin of dimension-6 and dimension-8 squared contributions and implementing a cut on data. We find that setting $M_{WW} &lt; \Lambda$ is not strict enough to ensure that the hierarchy of EFT operators is respected for dimension-6 and dimension-8 contributions. We also show that, even when using a stricter cut on $M_{WW}$, due to different correlations between $M_{WW}$ and $M_{e\mu}$ at different EFT orders, the bins in $M_{e\mu}$ (the invariant mass of the leptons originating from $W$ decays) used in an EFT fit may not truly be in the regime of EFT validity when performing a dimension-6 fit with $M_{WW} &lt; \Lambda$. We also explore the correlations of three transverse mass observables: $M_{T1}, M_{T2}$ and $M_{T3}$, finding that $M_{T1}$ and $M_{T3}$ follow the $M_{WW}$ distribution more closely than $M_{e\mu}$. We present sensitivity studies using both the $M_{T3}$ distribution and $M_{e\mu}$ distribution. We test implementing an experimental cut on $M_{T3}$ in place of clipping the EFT simulation at $M_{WW} &lt; \Lambda$. We finally comment that adding $M_{WW} &lt; \Lambda$ cuts only to the EFT simulation could be interpreted as modifying the SMEFT expansion by a form factor and could therefore impact the model independence of EFT fits under this procedure.</description>

      <title>Radiative return at NLOPS accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative return, together with the energy scan, is the method used at flavour factories to measure the pion form factor, which is a crucial input for the data-driven dispersive computation of the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We consider the radiative hadronic and leptonic channels of main experimental interest, namely the processes $e^+e^-\to X^+X^-\gamma$, with $X = \{\pi \, , \mu \}$. For such processes, we compute the exact next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections matched to a Parton Shower (PS) to describe exclusive multiple photon emission. All sources of radiative corrections from initial-state and final-state radiation, as well as their interference, are considered according to QED for $e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ and QED$\oplus$F$\times$sQED (Factorised scalar QED) for $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$. We describe in detail the novel features of our PS approach to compute the fixed-order corrections in association with higher-order contributions to $2\to3$ processes, with a hard photon in the final state. We present validation tests and comparisons with NLO predictions available in the literature to cross-check various ingredients of our formulation. We also show numerical results at NLOPS accuracy according to realistic event selection criteria for precision measurements at flavour factories. Our calculation is implemented in an updated version of the Monte Carlo event generator BabaYaga@NLO, which can be used for fully exclusive simulations and data analysis in radiative return experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Neutrino Deficit via Torsion-Induced Flavor Change in f(T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the spacetime torsion can modify neutrino flavor oscillations in f(T) gravity. This offers a probe of modified teleparallel gravity in astrophysical environments. By using the Dirac action in teleparallel geometry, we derive an effective coupling between the torsion vector and neutrino current. In the weak-field limit around a spherical mass, we obtain analytical expressions for torsion-induced phase shifts and effective mass-squared differences. Our results indicate that both vacuum oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in matter are affected by these torsion-based modifications. Using solar neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we constrain the teleparallel model parameters and also the neutrino-torsion coupling.</description>

      <title>How well does NRQCD describe quarkonium production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question how well nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization can describe quarkonium production has been subject to debate since its invention. We review our recent reanalysis of a classic next-to-leading order color octet (CO) long distance matrix element (LDME) fit to large transverse momentum $p_T$ $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ LHC production data. Our analysis differs from previous analyses of this kind not only by implementing for the first time a systematic treatment of scale uncertainties, but also by scrutinizing a much broader range of observables. Surprisingly, $J/\psi$ hadroproduction is well described up to the highest measured values of $p_T$. Potential NRQCD based relations nontrivially lead to a perfect description of $\Upsilon(nS)$ production data. Furthermore, $J/\psi$ production in $\gamma p$ and $\gamma \gamma$ collisions is, contrary to prevailing conceptions, reproduced down to $p_T=1$ GeV, as long as the region of large inelasticity $z$ is excluded. The overall picture is much rosier than usually perceived, the more so as the remaining discrepancies appear in phase space regions where solutions via varying kinds of resummations have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Discriminating QCD Compton and Quark-Antiquark Annihilation Processes in $\gamma$ + Jets Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how effectively final-state jet substructure can discriminate between QCD Compton and quark-antiquark annihilation processes from photon-jet production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Using infrared- and collinear-safe jet observables, multivariate classifiers -- boosted decision trees and multilayer perceptrons -- are trained on labeled quark- and gluon-initiated jets from dijet events and applied to photon-jet samples. Observables probing soft and wide-angle radiation, in particular jet multiplicity and jet girth, dominate the discrimination. The jet mass provides a complementary but weaker contribution, while the jet charge exhibits negligible discriminating power. A comparison of the two classifiers demonstrates that the achievable separation is limited primarily by QCD radiation effects rather than by classifier complexity. These findings quantify the extent to which information about the underlying hard process survives hadronization and realistic jet reconstruction, providing a physics-driven baseline for precision jet measurements in $pp$, $ep/$A, and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>From $B_c$ mesons to the baryon asymmetry: a unified $B$ Mesogenesis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $B$ mesogenesis offers an interesting mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe by converting the CP violation of the Standard Model into a net baryon number asymmetry. In this work we refine and extend the $B$ mesogenesis framework by incorporating all relevant $B$ meson channels active after low-temperature reheating. We first update the known neutral-meson contribution using time-integrated decay rates. While the $B_s^0$ contribution remains essentially unchanged, we find a suppression of the $B_d^0$ term by a factor $\sim 0.4$ with respect to previous analyses, alleviating the tension associated with its expected negative sign.
  We then perform a systematic study of $B_c^+$ decays, which are basically unexplored. We provide branching-ratio predictions using both leading-order factorization and a data-driven approach inspired by $D\to M_1M_2$ decays. These estimates allow us to quantify two $B_c^+$ sources of mesogenesis: the previously discussed $B_c^+ \to B^+ M^0$ channel and a new mechanism introduced in this work, $B_c^+ \to B_q^0 M$, in which the asymmetry is generated by combining direct CP violation with neutral-meson oscillations. Interestingly, in these channels the charm quark decays. Therefore, these decays give access to {\it charm CP violation} in modes with percent level branching ratios. With moderate assumptions, we find that $B_c^+$ mesogenesis can match or exceed the neutral contribution.
  Finally, we combine all three mechanisms and explore their viability in terms of the direct CP asymmetry, neutral-meson mixing parameters and early-universe fragmentation fractions. We find that successful baryogenesis can be achieved in a broad parameter space, showing the viability of $B$ mesogenesis. Future measurements of $B_c^+$ modes are thus highly anticipated to further probe the viability of unified $B$ mesogenesis.</description>

      <title>The leading Lyapunov exponent in the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that small perturbations in the boost-invariant color fields of the glasma exhibit an exponential growth with the square root of time. We interpret this growth rate as a Lyapunov exponent, related to entropy production and the thermalization timescale in the earliest stage of heavy-ion collisions. Working in a regime that is linear in this perturbation, we extract the time dependence of this mode as $\sim \exp(0.4\sqrt{g^2\mu\tau})$ for SU($2$), where $g^2\mu$ is proportional to the saturation scale and the square-root dependence is caused by the boost-invariant expansion of the system. We show that the growth rate of this mode is, unlike its amplitude, remarkably insensitive to the details of how the perturbations are initialized. In particular, we show that the unstable mode couples to all momentum scales present in the initial perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter equation for the lightest scalar glueball (0++) in pure Yang-Mills theory, using the refined Gribov-Zwanziger gluon tree-level propagator as an infrared-complete input. In a minimal ladder truncation with an effective constant kernel strength g_C^2 and the dominant s-wave component, we extract scalar glueball masses in the range 1.7-2.3 GeV for representative values of g_C^2, with a preferred value around 1.9 GeV near g_C^2 = 0.54. The result is consistent with RGZ correlator-based infrared moment analyses and with lattice expectations, providing a cross-check of RGZ-inspired infrared gluodynamics from a bound-state viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and the QCD Axion: Lecture Notes via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a self-contained, graduate-level introduction to the strong $CP$ problem and QCD axion physics from an effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint. We review the construction of the chiral EFT of QCD yielding a $\theta$-dependent potential, from which vacuum alignment, $\theta$ periodicity and branch structure follow. We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $\theta$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $\theta$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Resonances: Imprints of ultralight dark matter at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models where ultralight fields constitute dark matter, the misalignment mechanism leads to coherent, low-amplitude oscillations in fundamental constants. This effect arises from effective operators that couple dark matter to Standard Model fields. We present different models that can induce these effective operators by integrating out a mediator field. For mediator masses within the reach of collider searches, an alternative way to discover ultralight dark matter is to search for a resonance. Due to being a mediator to dark matter, the mass of the mediator oscillates. The resonance therefore, should not appear as a single isolated peak, but is smeared out once data is averaged over an oscillation cycle or more. Remarkably, the oscillation period and amplitude are in the range of current and future collider searches, even though constraints from atomic clocks probing variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron mass are very strong. We recast existing searches and projections from Belle II, LHCb and SHiP for an `oscillating resonance', and discuss how the periodicity of the signal can be used to reconstruct the peak from mass-binned data. We further show that time-stamped data would allow to unfold the signal via a fast Fourier transform and determine the significance of the signal for different background levels. The discovery of an oscillating resonance at a collider, with characteristics as predicted in ultralight dark matter scenarios, would constitute a powerful probe of dark matter's underlying nature.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Effective Field Theory Framework for Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) stands out as a pivotal process for precision tests of the Standard Model electroweak sector, investigations of neutrino properties, and searches for new physics (NP). Recent experimental measurements by COHERENT, CONUS+, and ton-scale xenon detectors--including PandaX-4T and XENONnT--underscore the need for a systematic theoretical framework to bridge high-energy physics scenarios with low-energy observational data. In this work, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end effective field theory (EFT) framework for CE$\nu$NS, encompassing the complete energy scale hierarchy spanning the ultraviolet (UV) regime down to the nuclear sector. We consider the low-energy EFT (LEFT) operators up to dimension 8, incorporating their QCD renormalization group running effects, and employ the systematic spurion method to achieve the matching between these operators and the chiral Lagrangian. A full power counting analysis is performed, extending to nuclear response functions, which evaluates contributions from LEFT operators up to dimension 8 while accounting for the nucleon number enhancement effect intrinsic to CE$\nu$NS. Moreover, we match the relevant LEFT operators for CE$\nu$NS onto operators up to dimension 8 within the Standard Model EFT. By also providing their complete tree-level ultraviolet completions, this procedure establishes a consistent top-down theoretical workflow. Leveraging a broad suite of CE$\nu$NS experimental data, this framework enables a combined analysis to extract constraints on the scales of EFT operators and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful way to test models with feebly interacting particles in the MeV to GeV mass range is through proton beam-dump experiments. In this paper, we compare the current sensitivity of CERN's NA62 experiment running in beam-dump mode with that of a hypothetical experiment using the same detectors in a future CERN ECN3 beam-dump facility. When optimising such an experiment, the geometric setup is particularly relevant for the specific new-physics scenario under study, since different production mechanisms can generate different angular distributions of new particles. We show that even the most minimalistic reconfiguration of the existing NA62 experiment's detectors can already provide a very competitive sensitivity and collect data immediately after the beam is available.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gauge Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal gauge theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. This work extends previous studies, which focused on pure scalar-fermion theories, to all gauge theories coupled to an arbitrary matter sector. Path-integral methods are developed to study ensemble averages and thermal Green's functions of general operators, with an arbitrary number of points, in all interacting gauge theories. These methods cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. Generalized Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) conditions are obtained both in coordinate and in momentum space for operators in general representations of the Lorentz and internal symmetry group. This allows us to obtain all thermal propagators including those of gauge fields and Faddeev-Popov ghosts. By analyzing all interactions in detail, it is shown that, in perturbation theory, only the propagators are affected by the average angular momentum and the chemical potentials, the vertices remain unmodified. The paper presents fully model-independent results and can, therefore, be applied to any specific thermal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the type-A conformal anomaly in $2n$ dimensions follows from standard Stora-Zumino descent, starting from the Euler invariant polynomial for the Euclidean conformal group $SO(2n+1,1)$ in $6d$, thereby placing type-A anomalies on the same footing as ordinary perturbative t Hooft anomalies. We discuss implications for anomaly inflow, and t Hooft anomaly matching for the full conformal group with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In 4d, this enables the construction of a dilaton effective action matching the full type-A $SO(5,1)$ conformal anomaly.</description>

      <title>Q-balls from thermal balls during a first-order phase transition: a numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the Q-ball formation triggered by a cosmological first-order phase transition within the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. By performing lattice simulations, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics throughout the transition, providing a precise description of the Q-ball formation mechanism and the resulting mass spectrum. Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Interpolating conformal algebra in $(1+1)$ dimensions between the instant form and the light-front form of relativistic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the interpolating conformal algebra between the instant form dynamics (IFD) and the light-front dynamics (LFD) in $(1+1)$ dimensions, along with a $4\times4$ interpolating projective spacetime matrix representation. While there are six generators in the $(1+1)$ dimensional conformal algebra, the number of kinematic and dynamic generators dramatically changes in LFD, maximizing (minimizing) the number of kinematic (dynamic) generators to four (two) with respect to two (four) kinematic (dynamic) generators in IFD, as well as in any other forms of dynamics between IFD and LFD. It confirms and signifies the utility of LFD, saving substantial dynamical efforts in solving the $(1+1)$ dimensional quantum field theories. We also present $2\times2$ Pauli matrix representation of $(1+0)$ and $(0+1)$ conformal groups, and creation/annihilation operators of quantum simple harmonic oscillator representations of $(1+0)$ dimensional conformal groups.</description>

      <title>Extracting Nucleon Resonance Transition GPDs from $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the process in which Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) excites a baryon resonance. In particular, we assess, in DVCS leading to the Roper resonance, the relative importance of a "background'' process in which a pion is first emitted by the nucleon, which then undergoes a DVCS event. Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states.</description>

      <title>How transverse momentum conservation breaks azimuthal correlation factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of azimuthal two-particle correlation factorization, quantified by the ratios $r_2$ and $r_3$, serves as a sensitive probe of transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations. While hydrodynamic models predict $r_3 \leq 1$, experimental data from CMS in p-Pb collisions exhibit $r_3 &gt; 1$, presenting a clear puzzle. We show that transverse momentum conservation (TMC) is the key mechanism dictating this factorization breakdown in small systems. We systematically calculate the effect of TMC as a function of the momentum difference between particles across various multiplicity and momentum ranges. Our results are in quantitative agreement with CMS p-Pb data for both $r_2$ and $r_3$. A central finding is a sign rule: under TMC, the deviation $r_n - 1$ follows $\left ( - 1 \right )^{n+1} $, being negative for even and positive for odd harmonic orders $n$. This work establishes an analytical framework to quantify transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations and provides new insights into the origin of collectivity in small colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Octet baryon electroweak form factors in dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity of developing theoretical models for studying the electroweak structure of baryons in a nuclear medium, we apply a covariant quark model to study interactions of baryons with nuclear matter. The electromagnetic and axial form factors of the octet baryons are determined by combining a covariant quark model that takes into account the meson cloud dressing of the baryon cores, developed for free space, with the quark-meson coupling model in the extension to the nuclear medium. We discuss the medium modifications on the electroweak form factors of octet baryons for the range of densities from $\rho=0$ up to $\rho=2 \rho_0$, where $\rho_0= 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ is the normal nuclear matter density. We also study how the shape of the form factors is modified in finite nuclei due to the profile of the nuclear density distributions compared with calculations using the average density of the nucleus</description>

      <title>A self-consistent calculation of non-spherical Bose-Einstein correlation functions with Coulomb final-state interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle correlations and femtoscopy are a rich subfield of high-energy physics. As the experimental data become more precise, there is an increasing need for the theoretical calculations to provide better and more general descriptions of the measurements. One of the important new directions is the investigation of the precise shape of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions utilizing L\'evy-stable distributions. This work is a direct follow-up to our previous study, in which we developed a novel method for calculating Bose-Einstein correlation functions including the Coulomb final-state interaction. In this paper, we present a self-consistent generalization of the previous approach to non-spherical source functions and investigate the validity of the previously applied approximations assuming spherical symmetry. We present a software package that includes the calculation of a fully three-dimensional correlation function including the Coulomb interaction.</description>

Abstract: While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to cosmological data, it fails to address many of the outstanding questions in contemporary cosmology. Chief among these are the Hubble tension and the apparent dynamical nature of dark energy as inferred from the recent DESI DR2 analysis. In this work, we analyze a field-theoretic description of cosmology where both dark energy and dark matter are interacting spin zero fields. We give a thorough study of a wide range of the interaction strength and demonstrate the effect on the dark energy equation of state and the Hubble tension. Using the recent cosmological data, we extract constraints on cosmological parameters including the free parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter and gravitational-wave production in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

      <title>Soft gluon resummation for gluon fusion $ZH$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of soft gluons on Higgs boson production in association with a $Z$ boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing the universal cusp anomalous dimensions and splitting kernels, we analyze effects of soft gluons on the gluon fusion $ZH$ process, focusing on the total production cross-section as well as the invariant mass distribution at the next-to-leading logarithmic level. Additionally, we estimate the next-to-soft effects on this subprocess to the same level of accuracy. A detailed phenomenological analysis is performed for the $13.6$ TeV LHC. Finally, combining these results with those from other subprocesses, we provide comprehensive predictions for the $ZH$ production cross-section and the invariant mass distribution that will be valuable for comparison with experimental data from the upcoming LHC run as well as the future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>RelExt: A New Dark Matter Tool for the Exploration of Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the C++ program RelExt for Standard Model (SM) extensions that feature a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The tool allows to efficiently scan the parameter spaces of these models to find parameter combinations that lead to relic density values which are compatible with the measured value within the uncertainty specified by the user. The code computes the relic density for freeze-out (co-)annihilation processes. The user can choose between several pre-installed models or any arbitrary other model featuring a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, by solely providing the corresponding FeynRules model files. The code automatically generates the required (co-)annihilation amplitudes and thermally averaged cross sections, including the total widths in the $s$-channel mediators, and solves the Boltzmann equation to determine the relic density. It can easily be linked to other tools like e.g.~ScannerS to check for the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, or to BSMPT to investigate the phase history of the model and possibly related gravitational waves signals.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the "nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least in medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessarily the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown regarding such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect of $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Production of $\Xi(1530)$ in the $K^- p$ scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine the production of $\Xi(1530)$ in the $K^- p \to K^{+} \Xi(1530)^{-}$ and $K^- p \to K^{0} \Xi(1530)^{0}$ reactions utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach. To accurately fit the cross sections for both processes, we include nine $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ hyperons and their resonances in both $s$- and $u$-channel processes. Considering the discrepancy of the measured cross sections for $K^- p \to K^+ \Xi(1530)^-$ within the range $\sqrt{s}=[2.087, 2.168]\ \mathrm{GeV}$, we employ two distinct fitting strategies: a uniform weighting scheme (model A) and a different weighting approach (model B). A comparative analysis suggests that model A yields a superior global agreement with experimental data compared to model B. Beyond fitting the cross sections, we also estimate the individual contributions from various intermediate states. Our results reveal that the cross section arising from the $\Sigma(1193)$ intermediate process is dominant. Furthermore, we predict different cross sections for $K^- p\to K^+\Xi(1530)^-$ and $K^- p\to K^0\Xi(1530)^0$ at several representative center-of-mass energies, providing testable predictions for forthcoming J-PARC experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent flow vector decorrelation in p--Pb collisions with a Multi-Phase Transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The event-by-event fluctuations in the initial energy density of the nuclear collisions lead to the decorrelation of second order flow vector, as known as its transverse-momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) dependence as observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Existing measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider shown that these decorrelations are also observed in small collision systems. In this work, a systematic study of the transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent flow vector decorrelation is performed in p--Pb collisions at the 5.02 TeV with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model using different tunings of the initial conditions, partonic and hadronic interactions. It is found that the string-melting version of the AMPT model provides a reasonable description of the measured flow vector decorrelation as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\eta$. We demonstrate that the hadronic scatterings do not have significant impact on decorrelation in p--Pb collisions for different centrality selections, while both initial conditions and partonic interactions influence the magnitude of the decorrelations. In addition, we found that the subtraction of the nonflow, especially the long-range jet correlation, is crucial for the accurate extraction of the flow vector decorrelation in small collision systems. The comparison of data and model presented in this paper provide further insights in understanding the fluctuations of the flow vector with $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\eta$ in small collision systems and has referential value for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Is flavor discrete?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance of the discrete symmetries for explanation of the observed flavor structures in the leptonic sector is considered. Achievements of the "traditional'' discrete symmetry approach and the modular symmetry approach are confronted. Minimal models with small number of parameters do not work. Complication of symmetry prescriptions allow to introduce new free parameters and thus describe the data but simultaneously bring two connected problems: (i) problem of "missing" representations, and (ii) problem of selection of certain point in huge discrete parameter space formed by possible charge assignments. Both problems must be addressed in complete model. Alternatively, one can keep minimal symmetry prescription but extend models introducing new physics unrelated to the original flavor symmetry. The low energy predictions can be "polluted" by additional physics such as effects of coupling to hidden sector, RGE running, decoupling of heavy degrees of freedom, mixing with sterile neutrinos, {\it etc.} The set up with discrete symmetries in the Hidden sector which communicates to the visible one via the neutrino portal and the basis fixing symmetry still looks promising.</description>

      <title>The $1/N_c$ Operator Analysis of the Combined Octet and Decuplet Baryons Contact Interactions in SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the non-derivative four-point interactions for Octet and Decuplet baryons in the SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) framework, and there are 104 coupling constant terms. The non-relativistic expansion of the baryon fields has been considered up to the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) of the three-momentum expansion. We find 28 and 106 Low-Energy Constants (LECs) for Leading Order (LO) and NLO, respectively. Using the Hartree Hamiltonian of the $1/N_c$ expansion of the operator product up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), we can reduce the free parameters (LECs) of the ChEFT from 134 down to 24 up to NLO of the three-momentum expansion. Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the $1/N_c$ sum rules in $\Omega\Omega$ and $\Omega N$ scatterings, where the future results from lattice QCD can be used to test our sum rules.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter Axions via the Quantum Hall Effect in a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for detecting dark matter axions using a resonant cavity coupled with a quantum Hall system. When a sample exhibiting quantum Hall effect is placed inside the cavity and the cavity is tuned to resonance, two-dimensional electrons absorb the amplified radiation, leading to a rise in the sample's temperature. By monitoring this temperature increase, the mass $m_a$ of the axion can be inferred. As an example, consider a GaAs sample with small thickness $d = 1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ and its heat capacity $C_s$ at temperature $T = 20\,\mathrm{mK}$. According to the QCD axion model, because the energy flux of the incoming radiation is $P_{ra}\sim 10^{-18}g_{\gamma}^2\mbox{W cm}^{-2}(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2 (\rho_d/0.3\rm GeV cm^{-3})$ at the resonance with $g_{\gamma}(\rm KSVZ)=-0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\rm DFSZ)=0.37$, the temperature increase $(P_{ra}/C_s)\times t_{ob}$ is approximately $\simeq 0.72(\mbox{mK})(t_{ob}/1\text{s})\,g_{\gamma}^2\,(20\mbox{mK}/T)^3(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2(1\mu \text{m}/d)$, where $t_{ob}$ is the observation time. It must be smaller than a time constant $\tau$ associated with the heat dissipation into thermal bath. Such a large time constant should be realized by making thermal conductance much small.</description>

      <title>Quark, lepton and right-handed neutrino production via inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.</description>

Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <title>Decaying vector dark matter with low reheating temperature for KM3NeT signal and its impact on gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violation: From Muon Decays to Muon Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the unique potential of a high-energy muon collider to probe lepton-flavor-violating signals arising from physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Low-energy, precision searches for charged lepton-flavor violation (LFV) are projected to dramatically improve their sensitivity in the coming years, and could provide the first evidence of new physics. We interpret the sensitivity of these searches in terms of a set of LFV operators in the SM Effective Field Theory. The same operators are then probed at the TeV scale by evaluating the projected reach of a muon collider while accounting for SM backgrounds and using a parameterized detector simulation. We find that for most operators, a muon collider could confirm signals if they are seen at future low energy experiments, whereas for certain flavor combinations it extends the reach to scales well beyond those accessible at lower energies. We also project the sensitivity of a muon collider to lepton flavor-violating decays of the SM Higgs boson and demonstrate improved sensitivity to $h \to e\tau$ and $h \to \mu\tau$ by an order of magnitude compared to the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of having multiple, complementary probes is illustrated by considering both various combinations of operators and relative sizes of flavor-violating transitions between generations under various assumptions for the flavor structure of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs are being measured with higher precision as the Run 3 stage of LHC continues. Models with multiple Higgs doublets allow potential deviations from the SM predictions. For more than two doublets, there are five possible types of models that avoid flavor changing neutral couplings at tree level by the addition of a symmetry. We consider a softly broken Z2xZ2 three-Higgs doublet model with explicit CP violation in the scalar sector, exploring all five possible types of coupling choices and all five mass orderings of the neutral scalar bosons. The phenomenological study is performed using a Machine Learning black box optimization algorithm that efficiently searches for the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings. We identify the model choices that allow a purely pseudoscalar coupling in light of all recent experimental limits, including direct searches for CP-violation, thus motivating increased effort into improving the experimental precision.</description>

      <title>The inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion in soft-virtual approximation at fourth order in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present precise results for the inclusive Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion at the LHC considering state-of-the-art fourth-order results in perturbative QCD arising from the dominant soft and virtual gluon emissions. Utilizing four-loop QCD results for the gluon-form factor, the splitting function and related anomalous dimensions, we study the effects of threshold enhanced soft gluon emissions and estimate their impact on the total cross-section at the fourth order. Our study highlights the role of these higher-order contributions in improving the perturbative convergence and in significantly reducing the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties. The results provide strong evidence for the perturbative stability and reliability of Higgs boson cross-section predictions at the LHC, thereby reinforcing the robustness of theoretical inputs in precision Higgs phenomenology. We also provide cross-section predictions using a large set of available parton distribution functions and show that, together with the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, they cause the largest residual uncertainty for the Higgs boson cross-section in gluon-gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information-theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe to nuclear cluster structure. For $^{20}$Ne, a novel approach is proposed to distinguish between the cluster configurations (5$\alpha$ versus $\alpha + ^{16}$O) in order to gain insight into nuclear structure transitions governed by many-body quantum correlations. Through analytical calculations with the microscopic Brink model and event-by-event simulations using the hydrodynamic framework, we establish the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC (3, 2) and the Pearson coefficient $\rho_2 (v_{2}^{2},\ \delta [p_{\mathrm{T}}])$ as quantitative discriminators to reveal enhanced cluster degrees of freedom in the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. The ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally identify these two competing configurations via these flow correlation observables, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>First Observations of Solar Halo Gamma Rays Over a Full Solar Cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>

      <title>From top quarks to enhanced quantum key distribution: A Framework for Optimal Predictability of Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work examines the application of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to four progressively complex models based on the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework. By incorporating single-particle spacings, pairing correlations, and rotational cranking terms, we evaluate VQE performance against exact diagonalization (ED) benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that while simpler models achieve high precision (errors $&lt;0.005$), the transition to 8-spin-orbital Hamiltonians reveals significant scaling and optimization challenges. Notably, we show that Model IV, which employs a more expressive RealAmplitudes ansatz, successfully captures the qualitative physics of rotational alignment and reduces energy deviations compared to intermediate benchmarks. These results establish a systematic methodological baseline, identifying the breaking points of hardware-efficient ansatz while validating the potential of QVAs to model the complex competition between pairing and rotation in deformed nuclei.</description>

      <title>Event Tokenization and Masked-Token Prediction for Anomaly Detection at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as unsupervised anomaly detectors in particle physics. Using lightweight LLM-like networks with encoder-based architectures trained to reconstruct background events via masked-token prediction, our method identifies anomalies through deviations in reconstruction performance, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. Applied to searches for simultaneous four-top-quark production, this token-based approach shows competitive performance against established unsupervised methods and effectively captures subtle discrepancies in collider data, suggesting a promising direction for model-independent searches for new physics.</description>
