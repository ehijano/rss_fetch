      <title>How Does a Protostar Form by Magnetized Gravitational Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation through the dynamical magnetized collapse remains an active area of astrophysical research. We carry out a comprehensive exploration on the magnetized gravitational collapse of a non-rotating self-gravitating initially spherically symmetric prestellar cloud core using two-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. Our study encompasses a broader range of equations of state (EOSs) in the form of $P(\rho) \propto \rho^{\Gamma}$, with the aim of constraining the choice of EOSs for allowing star formation. Our results reveal that the collapse with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than $4/3$, complemented by magnetized virial theorem, allows the dynamical contraction of the prestellar core to happen continuously where a central point mass forms and steadily builds up its mass from the infalling envelope, with a mass accretion rate of a scale of the order of $c_{\rm s}^3/G$. The choice of an isothermal EOS most naturally facilitates the collapse as a magnetic analog of the inside-out collapse. In addition to that, our study exhibits that the nonisothermal magnetized collapse models with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than 4/3 qualitatively demonstrate similar infall features to those of an isothermal EOS. Furthermore, the collapse models with a $\Gamma$ stiffer than $4/3$ fail to ensure the sufficient cooling to allow the direct mass growth of the central point mass, thus delaying the infall. Our work can offer deeper insights in understanding the significance of EOSs on the magnetized gravitational collapse, enabling star formation.</description>

      <title>Tales of Tension: Magnetized Infalling Clouds and Cold Streams in the CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed star formation and wind outflow rates in galaxies suggest cold gas must be continually replenished via infalling clouds or streams. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of cooling-induced condensation on such gas, which enables survival, mass growth, and a drag force which typically exceeds hydrodynamic drag. However, the combined effects of magnetic fields, cooling, and infall remains unexplored. We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of radiatively cooling infalling clouds and streams in uniform and stratified backgrounds. For infalling clouds, magnetic fields aligned with gravity do not impact cloud growth or dynamics significantly, although we see enhanced survival for stronger fields. By contrast, even weak transverse magnetic fields significantly slow cloud infall via magnetic drag, due to the development of strong draped fields which develop at peak infall velocity, before the cloud decelerates. Besides enhancing survival, long, slow infall increases total cloud mass growth compared to the hydrodynamic case, even if reduced turbulent mixing lowers the rate of mass growth. Streams often result in qualitatively different behavior. Mass growth and hence accretion drag are generally much lower in hydrodynamic streams. Unlike in clouds, aligned magnetic fields suppress mixing and thus both mass growth or loss. Transverse fields do apply magnetic drag and allow streams to grow, when the streams have a well-defined 'head' pushing through the surrounding medium. Overall, regardless of the efficacy of drag forces, streams are surprisingly robust in realistic potentials, as the destruction time when falling supersonically exceeds the infall time. We develop analytic models which reproduce cloud/stream trajectories.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM star clusters at cosmic dawn: stellar densities, environment, and equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe's early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at $z \geq 12$. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and non-virialized systems. Our findings indicate that high-$z$ star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.</description>

      <title>Where do High-Velocity Dark Matter Particles come from in the Milky Way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity particles ( $v&gt;v_\mathrm{esc}$) in the Milky Way are rare but nonetheless important to characterize due to their impact on dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments. We select halos similar in mass to the Milky Way in a large-volume dark matter simulation and measure the incidence of high-velocity particles, finding that an average fraction $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-5}$ of the DM particles have $\Delta v &gt; 600$ km/s within 5-11 kpc of the halo centers. However, some systems have dramatically higher fractions. Milky Way-like systems with high-speed satellites can have high-velocity DM fractions of order $\sim 100\times$ higher than average. The environment also affects high-velocity DM fractions; massive nearby halos ( $&gt;10^{13} M_{\odot}$) can boost high-velocity DM density by $\sim 10\times$, although there is little effect for nearby Andromeda-like systems. We confirm previous predictions from zoom-in simulations that the high-velocity particles in the Milky Way with heliocentric speeds $&gt;700$ km/s primarily originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and provide a table of expected high-velocity DM densities at different heliocentric velocity thresholds.</description>

      <title>Low-Eddington ratio, changing-look active galactic nuclei: the case of NGC 4614</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to be variable sources across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, in particular at optical/ultraviolet and X-ray energies. Over the past decades, a growing number of AGN have displayed type transitions: from type 1 to type 2 or viceversa within a few years or even several months. These galaxies have been commonly referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN). Here we report on a new CLAGN, NGC 4614, which transitioned from a type 1.9 to a type 2 state. NGC 4614 is a nearly face-on barred galaxy at redshift $z = 0.016$, classified as a low-luminosity AGN. Its central black hole has a mass of about $1.6\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio around 1 percent. We recently acquired optical spectra of NGC 4614 at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the data clearly suggest that the broad H$\alpha$ component has strongly dimmed, if not disappeared. A very recent Swift observation confirmed our current optical data, with the AGN weakened by almost a factor of 10 with respect to previous X-ray observations. Indeed, NGC 4614 had been also observed by Swift/XRT 6 times in 2011, when the source was clearly detected in all observations. By fitting the stack of the 2011 Swift observations we obtain a photon index of $\Gamma=1.3\pm0.3$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N_{\rm H}$=$1.2\pm0.3$ $\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that NGC 4614 can be moderately absorbed in the X-rays. Although a significant change in the foreground gas absorption that may have obscured the broad line region cannot be entirely ruled out, the most likely explanation for our optical and X-ray data is that NGC 4614 is experiencing a change in the accretion state that reduces the radiative efficiency of the X-ray corona.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of [Ne V] and [Ne VI] in M83: Evidence for the long sought-after AGN?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detections of [Ne V] 14.3 {\mu}m and [Ne VI] 7.7 {\mu}m at high confidence (S/N&gt;=6) in the nuclear region of the nearby spiral galaxy M83. Emission line maps of these high ionization lines show several compact structures. Specifically, the [Ne VI] emission is located at 140 pc from the optical nucleus and appears as a point source of size ~&lt;18 pc (FWHM =&lt;0.8"). We investigate the possible source of this extreme emission through comparison with photoionization models and ancillary data. We find that photoionization models of fast radiative shocks are able to reproduce the observed high excitation emission line fluxes only for the lowest preshock density available in the library, n =0.01 cm^-3. Additionally, tailored active galactic nuclei (AGN) photoionization models assuming a two-zone structure are compatible with the observed high ionization fluxes. Our simple AGN model shows that the emission at the location of the [Ne VI] source can be the result of a cloud being ionized by the radiation cone of an AGN. We stress, however, that to definitively confirm an AGN as the main source of the observed emission, more complex modeling accounting for different geometries is required. Previously known as a purely starburst system, these new findings of the nuclear region of M83 will require a reassessment of its nature and of objects similar to it, particularly now that we have access to the unparalleled infrared sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Massive Black Hole 0.8 kpc from the Host Nucleus Revealed by the Offset Tidal Disruption Event AT2024tvd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that are spatially offset from the nucleus of their host galaxies offer a new probe of massive black hole (MBH) wanderers, binaries, triples, and recoiling MBHs. Here we present AT2024tvd, the first off-nuclear TDE identified through optical sky surveys. High-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows that AT2024tvd is $0.914\pm 0.010$ arcsec offset from the apparent center of its host galaxy, corresponding to a projected distance of $0.808\pm 0.009$ kpc at $z=0.045$. AT2024tvd exhibits typical properties of nuclear TDEs, including a persistent hot UV/optical component that peaks at $L_{ bb}\sim 6\times 10^{43}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, broad hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, and delayed brightening of luminous ($L_{ X,peak}\sim 3\times 10^{43}\,erg\,s^{-1}$), highly variable soft X-ray emission. The MBH mass of AT2024tvd is $10^{6\pm1}\,M_\odot$, at least 10 times lower than its host galaxy's central black hole mass ($\gtrsim 10^8\,M_\odot$). The MBH in AT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy in a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH ejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known off-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM\,J2150 and EP240222a), which likely involve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the parent galaxies of all three events are very massive ($\sim 10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$). This result aligns with expectations from cosmological simulations that the number of offset MBHs scales linearly with the host halo mass.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Energy Distributions of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy represents the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted across all wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays. The galaxy SED is akin to its fingerprint, and serves as a fundamental tool in modern astrophysics. It enables researchers to determine crucial properties of galaxies, including their star-formation rates, stellar populations, dust content, and evolutionary state. By analyzing galactic SEDs, astronomers can reconstruct the physical processes occurring within galaxies and trace their evolutionary histories. This article explores our current understanding of the components that contribute to galactic SEDs, the observational techniques used to measure them, and their applications in understanding galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of metallicity populations in Omega Centauri using Gaia Focused Product Release and Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Omega Cen is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is also quite a complex object with a large metallicity spread and multiple stellar populations. Despite a number of studies over the past several decades, the series of events that led to the formation of this cluster is still poorly understood. One of its peculiarities is the presence of a metal-rich population which does not show the phenomenon of light-element anti-correlations (C-N, Na-O, Mg-Al), a trait that is considered as characteristic of Galactic Globular Clusters, and is in fact present among more metal-poor Omega Cen stars, leading to speculations that such anomalous population was accreted by the cluster. In this paper, we aim at investigating the kinematics of Omega Cen populations to gain insight on the formation scenario of the cluster. Using the newly released Gaia FPR and DR3 catalogue, we conducted a detailed kinematical analysis of cluster members within Omega Cen. The cluster members were divided into four metallicity populations and their mean proper motion in radial and tangential components were compared with each other. We also performed Gaussian Mixture Model fitting on the metallicity distribution to estimate the number of populations within our sample and an independent analysis of the HST catalogue as confirmation. The mean proper motions (mu_r and mu_t) of the metallicity populations do not show any significant differences. It is also not dependent on the approach chosen to determine the number of metallicity populations. We do find clear signature of rotation in all of the populations (including the metal-rich) with similar velocities.</description>

      <title>The First Chemical Census the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important step in understanding the formation and evolution of the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) is to investigate its chemistry and chemical evolution. Additionally, exploring the relationship of the NSC to the other structures in the Galactic Center and the Milky Way disks is of great interest. Extreme optical extinction has previously prevented optical studies, but near-IR high-resolution spectroscopy is now possible. Here, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 19 elements - more than four times as many as previously published - for 9 stars in the NSC of the Milky Way, observed with the IGRINS spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. This study provides new, crucial observational evidence to shed light on the origin of the NSC. We demonstrate that it is possible to probe a variety of nucleosynthetic channels, reflecting different chemical evolution timescales. Our findings reveal that the NSC trends for the elements F, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, as well as the s-process elements Ba, Ce, Nd, and Yb, generally follow the inner bulge trends within uncertainties. This suggests a likely shared evolutionary history and our results indicate that the NSC population is consistent with the chemical sequence observed in the inner Galaxy (the inner-disk sequence). However, we identify a significant and unexplained difference in the form of higher Na abundances in the NSC compared to the inner-bulge. This is also observed in few Galactic globular clusters, and may suggest a common enrichment process at work in all these systems.</description>

      <title>Termination of bottom-up interstellar aromatic ring formation at C6H5+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aromatic molecule benzene is considered the essential building block for larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in space. Despite benzene's importance in the formation of PAHs, the formation mechanisms of interstellar benzene are not well understood. A single ion-molecule reaction sequence is considered when modeling the formation of benzene in the interstellar medium, beginning with the protonation of acetylene. Although this process has been used to model the initial steps for formation of PAHs, it has not been experimentally measured. To explore this reaction mechanism, we have carried out the first experimental study of sequential ion-molecule reactions beginning with protonation of acetylene at single-collision conditions. Surprisingly, we find that the reaction sequence does not result in benzene and instead terminates at C6H5+, which is unreactive toward both acetylene and hydrogen. This result disproves the previously proposed mechanism for interstellar benzene formation, critically altering our understanding of interstellar PAH formation.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the formation of gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies from the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Reduced) Using the NewHorizon simulation, we have studied ten gas-versus-star counter-rotating galaxies in field environments with a stellar mass of M*~[1-5]x10^10 Msun. For all of them, the retrograde accretion of gas either from gas stripping from a nearby companion or from the circumgalactic medium is the starting point of the formation process. Then follows the co-existence of two distinct disks of gas rotating in opposite directions, the pre-existing one in the inner parts and the accreted gas in the outer parts of the galaxy. The latter progressively replaces the former leading to the final gas-star kinetic misalignment configuration. During the process, the star formation is first enhanced and then progressively decreases. We roughly estimate that a higher fraction of the pre-existing gas is converted into stars rather than being expelled. We also found that the black hole activity (BH) tends to be enhanced during the removal of the pre-existing gas. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the formation of a counter-rotating gas component is always accompanied with the formation of counter-rotating stellar disks. These stellar disks can have diverse properties but host in general a younger and more metal rich population of stars with respect to the main disc, depending on the star formation history and BH activity. The central part of counter-rotating disks tend also to be characterized by a younger population, an enhanced star formation rate and a higher metallicity than their outer parts. The high metallicity comes the progressive metal enrichment of the accreted gas by mixing with the pre-existing gas and by supernovae activity as it sinks toward the center of the galaxy. In case of major mergers, a large amount of accreted stars from the companion would be distributed at large distances from the remnant center due to conservation of the initial orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Dynamical heating of newborn stars driven by accretion-induced orbital tightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we have shown that stars in the Orion and the Lagoon Nebula Clusters, and simulations of collapsing clouds, exhibit constant velocity dispersion as a function of mass, a result described by Lynden-Bell 50 years ago as an effect of a violent relaxation mechanism. In contrast, numerical simulations of turbulent clouds show that newborn massive stars experience stronger dynamical heating than low-mass stars. We analyzed turbulent numerical simulations and found that this effect arises from the fact that, in clouds that are globally turbulence-supported against collapse, massive stars are formed within more massive and denser clumps and in more crowded environments compared to low-mass stars. This allows them to accrete more mass and interact with other stars simultaneously. As they become more massive, their orbits tighten, increasing their velocity dispersion. In contrast, low-mass stars are formed in the periphery of such cores, more separated, and at lower densities. Thus, their velocity dispersion remains lower because they do not accrete as vigorously as massive stars and tend to be more isolated. We call this mechanism "accretion-induced orbital tightening." Our results and previous findings about violent relaxation provide a key observational diagnostic of how to distinguish the dynamic state of star-forming molecular clouds through the kinematics of their newborn stars.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Identifying Open Star Cluster Members in {\it Gaia} DR3: Integrating MST and GMM Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for identifying members of open star clusters using Gaia DR3 data by combining Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) techniques. Our method employs a three-step process: initial filtering based on astrometric parameters, MST analysis for spatial distribution filtering, and GMM for final membership probability determination. We tested this methodology on 12+1 open clusters of varying ages, distances, and richness. The method demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing cluster members from field stars, particularly in regions with overlapping populations, as evidenced by its application to clusters like NGC 7790. By effectively reducing the number of probable field stars through MST analysis before applying GMM, our approach enhances both computational efficiency and membership determination accuracy. The results show strong agreement with previous studies while offering improved precision in member identification. This method provides a robust framework for analyzing the extensive datasets provided by Gaia DR3, addressing the challenges of processing large-scale astronomical data while maintaining high accuracy in cluster membership determination.</description>

      <title>DDO68-C: HST confirms yet another companion of the isolated dwarf galaxy DDO 68</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of the dwarf galaxy DDO 68-C, proposed as possibly associated with the isolated peculiar dwarf DDO 68. The new data resolve for the first time the stars of DDO 68-C down to well below the tip of the Red Giant Branch (RGB), revealing a low mass (M$_{*}$ $\sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$) star forming galaxy with a backbone of old stars. By means of a fully homogeneous analysis and using the RGB tip as a standard candle, we find that DDO 68 and DDO 68-C lie at the same distance from us, within the uncertainties (D = 12.6 $\pm$ 0.3 Mpc and D = 12.7 $\pm$ 0.4 Mpc, respectively), thus confirming that the two dwarfs are physically associated. While paired dwarf galaxies with mutual projected distance similar to DDO 68 and DDO 68-C are not exceptional in the Lynx-Cancer Void where they live, DDO 68 remains a unicum as, in addition to the newly confirmed companion, it records the evidence of at least two other satellites.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal filaments and AGN recurrent activity in the galaxy group Nest200047: a LOFAR, uGMRT, MeerKAT, VLA radio spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.</description>

      <title>Water Nucleation via Transient Bonds to Oxygen Functionalized Graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study the initial stages of ice growth on pristine and oxygen-functionalized highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (O-HOPG), combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) and machine-learning structural searches. LT-STM images show that oxygen atoms act as nucleation sites for ice growth, and that the size, structure and porosity of the nanometer-sized ice clusters depend strongly on the growth temperature. Machine learning-assisted structural searches and first-principles energy calculations confirm that clusters of water molecules are likely to bind to chemisorbed oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonding. During the early stages of the cluster growth clusters of water molecules are likely to be immobilized by binding to more than one chemisorbed oxygen atom through hydrogen bonding. However, the energy gain by hydrogen bond formation of a molecule, upon incorporation into smaller clusters only bound to a single oxygen atom, is large enough to induce cluster diffusion and favor the growth of larger ice clusters. Our results demonstrate that the mobility of water molecules is significantly lowered in the presence of defects on the surface. The observed lower mobility on defected carbon presented here offers an enhanced understanding of macroscopic anti-icing properties observed for functionalized HOPG under ambient conditions and provides insight into the early stages of ice growth on dust grain surfaces in interstellar space.</description>

      <title>High-velocity outflows in [OIII] emitters at z=2.5-9 from JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify galaxies hosting ionised-gas high-velocity outflows from the complete sample of medium resolution (R1000) JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). From a total sample of 1087 [OIII]5007 emitters we identify 40 galaxies with a blue-side broadened [OIII]5007 line at z=2.5-9. Of these, 34 are strong outflow candidates whilst 6 sources have broadening potentially driven by rotating clumps. Our outflow candidate sample is mainly composed of star-forming galaxies, including ~65 starbursts, which span the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)=7.5-11.0. It also includes two candidate type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a 'little red dot' (LRD). We report a median outflow velocity of 531(+146)(-159) km/s and an overall incidence rate of 3.4%. These values are significantly higher and lower respectively than recent similar works, which we accredit to the limiting resolution of the R1000 spectroscopy and a stricter outflow selection criterion. We find no correlation between the outflow velocity and the galaxy stellar mass or star-formation rate. The median ratio between outflow velocity and escape velocity is 0.77(+0.36)(-0.32), indicating that most outflows cannot escape the galaxy gravitational potentials. We do find an anti-correlation between mass loading factor and stellar mass up to M* ~(10^10)Msun, with most lowest stellar-mass M*&lt;(10^9)Msun galaxies reaching values well above unity, as is the case for local starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galactic foreground emissions randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized plasma dominated by magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology in the frames of distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations in the frames of the distributed chaos notion.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundance ratios for the bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present abundance ratio estimates of individual elements, namely C, N, Na, and the so-called alpha elements, Mg, O, Si, Ca, and Ti, for the bulge of M31. The analysis is based on long-slit, high-quality spectroscopy of the bulge, taken with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC). Abundance ratios, [X/Fe]s, are inferred by comparing radially binned spectra of M31 with different state-of-the-art stellar population models, averaging out results from various methods, namely full-spectral, full-index, and line-strength fitting, respectively. For the bulk of the bulge, we find that O, N, and Na are significantly enhanced compared to Fe, with abundances of about 0.3dex, followed by C, Mg, and Si, with [X/Fe] about 0.2dex, and lastly, Ti and Ca, mostly tracking Fe ([X/Fe]&lt;0.1dex), within the error bars. Performing the same analysis on SDSS stacked spectra of early-type galaxies with different velocity dispersion, we find that the abundance pattern of the M31 bulge is very similar to that of most massive galaxies, supporting a scenario where most of the bulge formed in a fast and intense episode of star-formation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts $z\sim$0.2--0.5 with JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 $\mu m$ aromatic and 3.4 $\mu m$ aliphatic C--H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts $z$$\sim$0.2--0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies ($L_{\rm IR}\gtrsim10^{11}~L_\odot$) at $z\lesssim0.1$, we probe 200 galaxies down to $L_{\rm IR}$$\sim$$10^{8.5}$--$10^{10}~L_\odot$ well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 $\mu m$ emission is detected at $\geq$3-$\sigma$ in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 $\mu m$-to-IR luminosity ratio ($L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR}$) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of $L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR}$ by a factor of $\gtrsim10$ at 12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.4--8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 $\mu m$ emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 $\mu m$-to-3.3 $\mu m$ luminosity ratio ($L_{3.4}/L_{3.3}$) spanning from $\sim$0.05 to $\sim$0.58 (median $\sim$0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of $\sim$0.78%--8.3% (median $\sim$2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While $L_{3.4}/L_{3.3}$ does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>SHAM-OT: Rapid Subhalo Abundance Matching with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is widely used for connecting galaxies to dark matter haloes. In SHAM, galaxies and (sub-)haloes are sorted according to their mass (or mass proxy) and matched by their rank order. In this work, we show that SHAM is the solution of the optimal transport (OT) problem on empirical distributions (samples or catalogues) for any metric transport cost function. In the limit of large number of samples, it converges to the solution of the OT problem between continuous distributions. We propose SHAM-OT: a formulation of abundance matching where the halo-galaxy relation is obtained as the optimal transport plan between galaxy and halo mass functions. By working directly on these (discretized) functions, SHAM-OT eliminates the need for sampling or sorting and is solved using efficient OT algorithms at negligible compute and memory cost. Scatter in the galaxy-halo relation can be naturally incorporated through regularization of the transport plan. SHAM-OT can easily be generalized to multiple marginal distributions. We validate our method using analytical tests with varying cosmology and luminosity function parameters, and on simulated halo catalogues. The efficiency of SHAM-OT makes it particularly advantageous for Bayesian inference that requires marginalization over stellar mass or luminosity function uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Low Universal Equilibrium Black Hole Spin in Luminous Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic collimated outflows, or jets, provide a crucial mode of active galactic nucleus feedback. Although the jets extract their energy from the black hole (BH) rotation, their effect on the BH spin is poorly understood. Because the spin controls radiative and mechanical BH feedback, lack of first-principles models for BH spin evolution limits our ability to interpret observations, including the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA spin constraints. Particularly important are luminous disks, which rapidly grow and strongly torque their BHs. Jet-less and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks spin-up their BHs to near-maximum dimensionless spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$. However, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk to enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently extract BH rotational energy and significantly spin-down the BH. Indeed, Lowell et al. 2024 found that non-radiative MADs spin-down their BHs to very low $a_\text{eq,MAD}^\text{nr}=0.07$. Moreover, their analytic model predicted that luminous MADs also spin-down their BHs to low $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\sim0.3-0.5$. To test this prediction, we perform 3D general relativistic (radiation) magnetohydrodynamic (GR(R)MHD) simulations of MADs across a wide range of BH spin ($-0.9\le{}a\le0.99$) and disk dimensionless thickness ($0.03\le{}h/r\le0.3$, which corresponds to Eddington ratio, $0.35\le{}\dot{m}/\dot{m}_\text{Edd}\le\infty$). We find that luminous MADs spin-down their BHs to a low universal equilibrium spin value, $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\simeq0.3$ for $0.03\le{}h/r\le0.1$. Moreover, we find evidence for quadratic convergence, $a_{eq,MAD}\simeq0.31-2.71(h/r)^2\to0.31$ as $h/r\to0$. We attribute this to disk thermodynamics becoming irrelevant as the cooling becomes more aggressive and magnetic forces start to dominate. We finish by discussing the astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with One Galaxy: Auto-Encoding the Galaxy Properties Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations like CAMELS and IllustrisTNG characterize hundreds of thousands of galaxies using various internal properties. Previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to infer the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ from the internal properties of even a single randomly selected simulated galaxy. This ability was hypothesized to originate from galaxies occupying a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional galaxy property space, which shifts with variations in $\Omega_m$. In this work, we investigate how galaxies occupy the high-dimensional galaxy property space, particularly the effect of $\Omega_m$ and other cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the putative manifold. We achieve this by using an autoencoder with an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB), a neural layer with adaptive compression, to perform dimensionality reduction on individual galaxy properties from CAMELS simulations, which are run with various combinations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that for an autoencoder trained on the fiducial set of parameters, the reconstruction error increases significantly when the test set deviates from fiducial values of $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$, indicating that these parameters shift galaxies off the fiducial manifold. In contrast, variations in other parameters such as $\sigma_8$ cause negligible error changes, suggesting galaxies shift along the manifold. These findings provide direct evidence that the ability to infer $\Omega_m$ from individual galaxies is tied to the way $\Omega_m$ shifts the manifold. Physically, this implies that parameters like $\sigma_8$ produce galaxy property changes resembling natural scatter, while parameters like $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$ create unsampled properties, extending beyond the natural scatter in the fiducial model.</description>

      <title>The arc-shaped radio source at the center of NGC 6334A: Is it a colliding wind region of two young massive stars or the bow shock of a runaway star?</title>

Abstract: New multi-wavelength Karl G. Jansky VLA observations of CKR02A, the compact radio source in the center of the compact HII region NGC 6334A, are presented. The observations were carried out in five epochs and included the frequency ranges 8.0 - 12.0 GHz (X-band), 18.0 - 26.0 GHz (K-band), and 29.0 - 37.0 GHz (Ka-band). The source is detected and resolved in all the observed epochs and in all bands. The source shows a clear arc-shaped structure consistent with a bow shock. The analysis of the spectral index maps indicates that its spectral index is $\alpha=-0.68\pm0.17$, suggesting that the emission is non-thermal. Two astronomical objects can explain the emission nature and morphology of the source: a colliding wind region of two massive stars or the bow shock of a massive runaway star. However, no massive stars are reported so far in the center of NGC 6334A, though its presence is also suggested by the free-free radio emission of the C-HII region itself. Using ancillary VLA data, we measured a preliminary proper motion of $19\pm6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to a velocity of $120\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$. A detailed discussion of the implications of both scenarios is provided. Finally, a list of compact radio sources in the vicinity of NGC 6334A is given and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Search for new Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars using Gaia DR3. I. Candidate selection and the follow-up of the bright sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR3, released in June 2022, included low-resolution XP spectra that have been used for the classification of various types of emission-line objects through machine-learning techniques. The Gaia Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Emission-Line Stars (ESP-ELS) algorithm identified 565 sources as potential Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Over half of them were already known as WR stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. This study aimed to utilize Gaia DR3 data to identify new Galactic WR stars. We extracted all sources classified as WC or WN type stars by the ESP-ELS algorithm from the Gaia catalog. By applying judicious 2MASS color selection criteria, leveraging Gaia H$\alpha$ measurements, and filtering out objects already cataloged in various databases, we selected 37 bright candidates ($G \leq $ 16 mag) and 22 faint candidates ($G &gt; $ 16 mag). Spectroscopic follow-up observations of these candidates were conducted using the 2SPOT facilities in Chile and France, as well as 1-m C2PU's Epsilon telescope at the Calern Observatory. This paper focuses on the brighter sample. Among the 37 targets, we confirmed 17 and 16 new Galactic WC and WN type WR stars, respectively. Three of them were recently reported as new WR stars in an independent study. The Gaia mission provides a valuable resource for uncovering WR stars missed in earlier surveys. While this work concentrated on a relatively small starting sample provided by the ESP-ELS algorithm, our findings highlight the potential for refining selection criteria to identify additional candidates not included in the outputs of the algorithm. Furthermore, the observation program underscores the utility of small telescopes in acquiring initial spectral data for sources with magnitudes up to $G \sim 16$ mag.</description>

      <title>Erosion of a dense molecular core by a strong outflow from a massive protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 observations of N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) and CH$_3$CN (5-4), as well as Band 7 observations of the H$_2$CO molecular line emissions from the protostellar system GGD 27-MM2(E). Through position-velocity diagrams along and across the outflow axis, we study the kinematics and structure of the outflow. We also fit extracted spectra of the CH$_3$CN emission to obtain the physical conditions of the gas. We use the results to discuss the impact of the outflow on its surroundings. We find that N$_2$H$^+$ emission traces a dense molecular cloud surrounding GGD 27-MM2(E). We estimate that the mass of this cloud is $\sim$13.3-26.5 M$_\odot$. The molecular cloud contains an internal cavity aligned with the H$_2$CO-traced molecular outflow. The outflow, also traced by $\mathrm{CH_3 CN}$, shows evidence of a collision with a molecular core (MC), as indicated by the distinctive increases in the distinct physical properties of the gas such as excitation temperature, column density, line width, and velocity. This collision results in an X-shape structure in the northern part of the outflow around the position of the MC, which produces spray-shocked material downstream in the north of MC as observed in position-velocity diagrams both along and across of the outflow axis. The outflow has a mass of 1.7-2.1 M$_\odot$, a momentum of 7.8-10.1 M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$, a kinetic energy of 5.0-6.6$\times 10^{44}$ erg, and a mass loss rate of 4.9--6.0$\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The molecular outflow from GGD 27-MM2(E) significantly perturbs and erodes its parent cloud, compressing the gas of sources such as MC and ALMA 12. The feedback from this powerful protostellar outflow contributes to maintain the turbulence in the surrounding area.</description>

      <title>Stellar weak rates of the $rp$-process waiting points: Effects of strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating microscopic nuclear-structure information into the discussion of bulk properties of astronomical objects such as neutron stars has always been a challenging issue in interdisciplinary nuclear astrophysics. Using the $rp$-process nucleosynthesis as an example, we studied the effective stellar $\beta^+$ and electron capture (EC) rates of eight waiting-point (WP) nuclei with realistic stellar conditions and presence of strong magnetic fields. The relevant nuclear transition strengths are provided by the projected shell model. We have found that, on average, due to the magnetic field effect, the $\beta^+$ and EC rates can increase by more than an order of magnitude for all combinations of density and temperature, as well as in each of WPs studied. We relate the onset field strength, at which the weak rates begin to increase, to nuclear structure quantities, $Q$ value or electronic chemical potential $\mu_e$. The enhanced weak rates may change considerably the lifetime of WPs, thereby modifying the current understanding of the $rp$-process.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of the first stars can be determined via the 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the first stars and the subsequent population of X-ray binaries represents a fundamental transition in the state of the Universe as it evolves from near homogeneity to being abundant in collapsed structures such as galaxies. Due to a lack of direct observations, the properties of these stars remain highly uncertain. By considering the impact of the first stars and their remnant X-ray binaries on the cosmological 21-cm signal, we demonstrate that upcoming observations have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of these objects. We find a 25 mK sensitivity measurement of the 21-cm global signal by a wide-beam radiometer, such as REACH, or 3,000 hours of foreground avoidance observations of the 21-cm power spectrum by SKA-Low, could provide three-sigma constraints on the mass distribution of the first stars. Such measurements will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the early Universe and aid in interpreting high-redshift galaxy observations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Pulsating Variables and Eclipsing Binaries in NGC 2126 using Ground and Space-based Photometry, Astrometry, Spectroscopy and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsating variables are prevalent in the classical {\delta} Scuti instability strip of intermediate-age open star clusters. The cluster membership of these stars facilitates a comparative analysis of their evolution in analogous environments. In this study, we integrate ground-based observations, TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs), and Gaia DR3 data to investigate variable stars in the intermediate-age open star cluster NGC 2126. We performed ground-based time-series observations of NGC 2126 to identify variable stars within its vicinity. Next, we determined the membership of these stars using parallax and the proper motions from Gaia DR3 archive. Then, we searched the TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs) for counterparts to the variables identified above and performed their frequency analysis and classification. Finally, we modeled the light curves (LCs) of detected eclipsing binaries (EBs), including V551 Aur, which has a pulsating component. We found 25 members and 85 field variable stars. In TESS FFIs, we found LCs for 11 known variables and a new rotational variable. We determined that the pulsating EB V551 Aur is a member of the cluster. The low- and medium-resolution spectra revealed the line profile variation and the basic parameters for the star, respectively. Simultaneous modeling of the eclipses and the embedded pulsations resulted in improved orbital parameters for the binary system. We also report the determination of orbital parameters for the previously uncharacterized EB system UCAC4 700-043174.</description>

      <title>Variable stars in Galactic globular clusters II. Population II Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identified a sample of 88 bona fide Population II Cepheids (henceforth referred to as Cepheids) and 44 candidates in Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Seventy-eight of the Cepheids in the sample align within $2\,\sigma$ of the period-luminosity relation for Milky Way Type II Cepheids (T2CEPs). Nine align with the period-luminosity relation for fundamental-mode anomalous Cepheids (ACEPs), and only one (BL Bo\"otis) follows the relation for first-overtone ACEPs, as determined from observations of ACEPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud. For sources in common between our catalog and the OGLE catalog, the classification agrees in 94% of cases. In comparison, for sources shared between the Gaia Specific Object Study (SOS) and OGLE, the agreement is 74%. In the dense environments of GCs, our analysis shows that the completeness of the Gaia catalogs for Cepheids is 64% for the SOS and 74% for the classifier of variable stars. We determined the red and blue edges of the instability strip for T2CEPs using linear MESA-RSP models. We find that the best-fit models, with $M = 0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and Z = 0.0003, are able to fit $90%$ of the stars in our sample. This percentage is the same for helium abundances $Y = 0.220$ and $0.245$. Higher values of $Y$ lower this percentage, and the same effect is observed with lower values of $Z$. In the future, combining the sample of T2CEPs with the precise parallaxes obtained from GCs will strengthen the geometric calibration of a distance ladder based on Population II stars. This will be useful for determining distances within the Milky Way and for cross-checking distances to Local Group galaxies determined through other methods.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2002-BLG-360: a dusty anomaly among red nova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OGLE-2002-BLG-360 is an example of a Galactic red nova, the aftermath of a non-compact stellar merger. The dusty nature of the circumstellar environment makes observations of this particular source difficult, meaning the properties of the central star and its surrounding environment are poorly understood. We aim to establish the parameters of the merger remnant, as well as of the dusty environment and its structure. We attempt to establish similarities with other Galactic red novae and try to understand how such an environment has been formed. We use optical, infrared, and sub-millimetre observations to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 um and 1.27 mm for an epoch 15-21 years after the red nova eruption. We use various radiative transfer codes to model the SED and retrieve the physical properties of both the central star and the surrounding dust. We show that the SED is best replicated by a spherically symmetric model consisting of an M-type supergiant surrounded by 0.012 Msun of dust concentrated within two spherical shells. The dust extends out to a maximum distance of 9500 AU from the central source, whilst the inner shell extends out to 1000 AU. The dust composition is dominated by iron grains (58%), but also contains olivine silicates (25%) and alumina dust (17%), which are both required to reproduce the profile of the observed 10 um absorption feature. The inner shell likely originates from merger and post-merger ejecta, whilst the outer shell consists of material lost much earlier, before the merger event occurred. Evolution of the SED indicates continued dust formation within the expanding inner shell, which may be analogous to winds of red supergiants. The object is extremely dusty compared to other red nova remnants.</description>

      <title>The evolution of galaxy morphology from redshift z=6 to 3: Mock JWST observations of galaxies in the ASTRID simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with $3 \leq z \leq 6$. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-$M_{20}$) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.</description>

      <title>Rising from the Ashes: A Metallicity-Dependent Star Formation Gap Splits the Milky Way's alpha-Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elemental abundance distribution of stars encodes the history of the gas-phase abundance in the Milky Way. Without a large, unbiased sample of highly precise stellar ages, the exact timing and nature of this history must be inferred from the abundances. In the two-dimensional plane of [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H], it is now clear that two separate populations exist -- the low-alpha and high-alpha sequences. We propose that a brief (~300 Myr) halt in star formation within a narrow metallicity bin can lead to a bimodal [alpha/Fe] distribution at that metallicity, assuming a rapidly declining gas phase [alpha/Fe]. Using simulations of an idealized setup of a high-z galaxy merger, we show that the merger with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus satellite at z~2 is one possible way to trigger such a gap in the Milky Way. This mechanism may also operate in non-merger scenarios. We predict a ~300 Myr gap in stellar ages at a fixed [Fe/H] where the alpha-bimodality is prominent ([Fe/H]&lt;~-0.2)</description>

      <title>Constraining SN Ia Progenitors from the Observed Fe-peak Elemental Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of iron-peak elements in the red giants of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) are among the best diagnostics in the cosmos to probe the origin of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). We incorporate metallicity-dependent SN Ia nucleosynthesis models for different progenitor masses in our inhomogeneous galactic chemical evolution model, {\tt{i-GEtool}}, to recreate the observed elemental abundance patterns and their spread in a sample of UFD and dSph galaxies with different average metallicities and star formation histories. Observations across different environments indicate that [Mn/Mg] increases on average with metallicity while [Ni/Mg] remains nearly constant. The average dispersion of [X/Mg] from our UFD model ranges between $0.20$ and $0.25$ for iron-peak elements, with the exception of [Sc/Mg] that has $\sigma \approx 0.39$. Chemical evolution models assuming Chandrasekhar mass (M$_{\text{Ch}}$) SN Ia progenitors produce similar [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] abundance patterns to those observed in the examined UFD and dSph galaxies, without the need to invoke a substantial fraction of sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitors that change across different environments, as claimed by some previous chemical evolution studies. Sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitors in our dSph models under produce both [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] abundance patterns, with the $1\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ model explaining a number of outliers in [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H], while the outliers in [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] require higher sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitor masses.</description>

      <title>RUBIES Reveals a Massive Quiescent Galaxy at z=7.3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=7.29\pm0.01$, just $\sim700\,$Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at $z&gt;6$, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning $0.9-18\,\mu m$) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log$(M_*/M_\odot)=10.23^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ before $z\sim8$, and ceased forming stars $50-100\,$Myr prior to the time of observation, resulting in $\log(\rm{sSFR/Gyr}^{-1})&lt;-1$. We measure a small physical size of $209_{-24}^{+33}\,{\rm pc}$, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of $\log(\Sigma_{*,\rm e}/M_\odot\,kpc^{-2})=10.85_{-0.12}^{+0.11}$ comparable to the highest densities measured in quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2-5$. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at $z&gt;7$. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at $z\sim7$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Characterization of M51 supernova remnants with the imaging spectrometer SITELLE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of a detailed 3D study of supernova remnants in the nearby spiral M51 using data from the SIGNALS survey obtained with the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Data cubes covering the entire galaxy were gathered in three spectral ranges: SN3 (647-685 nm, R = 5000), SN2 (482-513 nm, R = 600) and SN1 (363-386 nm, R = 1000). The spectral resolution of the SN3 cube allows a precise, spatially resolved measurement of the velocity dispersion of each object. While most of the SNRs were known from previous surveys based on imagery and long-slit spectroscopy, we now provide 2D line flux and kinematic maps for all of them and found 20 new candidates. Most of the SNRs show velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) in the range 30-80 km/s, which is typical for middle-aged SNRs. Finally, we compare the properties of SNRs with those of thousands of HII regions included in the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Progenitor diversity in the accreted stellar halos of Milky Way-like galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing large stellar spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way seek to reconstruct the major events in the assembly history of the Galaxy. Chemical and kinematic observations can be used to separate the contributions of different progenitor galaxies to the present-day stellar halo. Here we compute the number of progenitors that contribute to the accreted stellar halos of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies as a function of radius (the radial diversity) in three suites of models: Bullock &amp; Johnston, Aquarius and Auriga. We show that there are significant differences between the predictions of these three models, beyond the halo-to-halo scatter expected in $\Lambda$CDM. Predictions of diversity from numerical simulations are sensitive to model-dependent assumptions regarding the efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies. We compare, at face value, to current constraints on the radial diversity of the Milky Way's accreted halo. These constraints imply that the halo of our Galaxy is dominated by $\sim2$ progenitors in the range $8-45\,\mathrm{kpc}$, in contrast to averages of $7$ progenitors in the Bullock &amp; Johnston models, $3.5$ in Aquarius and $4.2$ in Auriga over the same region. We additionally find that the models with radial diversity most similar to that of the Milky Way are predominantly those with ongoing merger events. The Milky Way therefore appears unusual in having an accreted stellar halo dominated by a small number of progenitors accreted at very early times.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra of JWST Images of Local Galaxies: Searching for Disk Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns. These slopes for one-dimensional PS are consistent with the PS slopes observed elsewhere using HI and dust emission. They are likely related to turbulence, but they may also be viewed as a hierarchical distribution of objects having a size-luminosity relation and size distribution function. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the mid-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could also be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.</description>

      <title>Signatures of simulated spiral arms on radial actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the various implications of the spiral arms, it has been observed in the Milky Way disc that the distribution of radial actions from the Gaia Data Release 3 exhibits structures that may be related to the spiral arms. Our goal is to investigate the relationship between regions of low radial action identified in simulated discs and the location of the spiral arms, such as that suggested in Palicio et al. (2023) for the Galaxy. For a sample of 23 simulated spiral galaxies, we modelled the axisymmetric component of their gravitational potential to compute the radial action of their stellar particles using the Staeckel fudge. The spatial distribution of the radial action was then compared to the location of the spiral arms, identified as overdensities in the stellar surface density using a kernel density estimator. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the radial action distribution and the spiral arms in 18 of 23 simulated galaxies. However, notable discrepancies are observed in the remaining five, since they are profoundly out-of-equilibrium systems, such as galaxies influenced by external interactions or spiral arms still in the process of winding up. We have confirmed that, in general, there is a tendency of spatial correlation between spiral arms and stellar populations featuring low values of the radial action, as discussed in Palicio et al. (2023). However, discrepancies between features in the radial action distribution and the spiral structure can be interpreted as signatures of recent disturbances, a scenario applicable to the Milky Way. Furthermore, populations at least as old as 3 Gyr trace the spiral arms with no significant misalignment across age bins. A linear relation between the maximum value of the radial action of the spiral arms and the vertical scale-length is found, which is also satisfied by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Investigating chemical variations between interstellar gas clouds in the Solar neighbourhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is a fundamental component of the Milky Way. Studying its chemical composition and the level of its chemical diversity gives us insight into the evolution of the Milky Way and the role of gas in the Galactic environment. In this paper, we use a novel simulation technique to model the distribution of total hydrogen between gas components, and therefore derive new constraints on the dust depletion and metallicity. We study individual gas components along the lines of sight towards eight bright O/B stars within 1.1 kpc of the Sun using high-resolution HST/STIS absorption spectra (R sim 114 000). We measure the level of dust depletion for these individual components and find components with higher levels of dust depletion compared to Milky Way sightlines in the literature. We find large ranges in the level of dust depletion among components along lines of sight, up to 1.19 dex. Although it is not possible to directly measure the metallicity of individual components due to the saturated and damped Ly-alpha line, we investigate possible metallicity ranges for individual gas components by exploring many different distributions of the total hydrogen gas between components. We select possible combinations of these gas fractions which produce the minimum metallicity difference between components, and for these cases we determine individual metallicities to accuracies that range between sim 0.1 to 0.4 dex. This work shows that full line-of-sight analyses wash out the level of diversity along lines of sight, and that component-by-component studies give a more in-depth understanding of the chemical intricacies of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Improved SED-Fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-Out Quenching at $z\sim0.5$ and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star-formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multiband flux profiles measured from Hubble Space Telescope images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.5$ of stellar masses $10^{10}-10^{11.5}\ M_{\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. The latter results in star formation rate and $A_V$ profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and $A_V$ profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at $z\sim1.3$ are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.9$, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 - 0.08~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at $z\sim0.9$ and quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. The former are shallower at all masses by $\sim0.1~\textrm{dex}~\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, at $z\sim0.9-1.3$, galaxies quench at all radii simultaneously, and at $z\sim0.5-0.9$, they quench from the inside-out.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of observable distributions for galaxies classified in the Projected Phase Space Diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of galaxy populations classified according to their kinematic behaviours and dynamical state using the Projected Phase Space Diagram (PPSD) are affected by misclassification and contamination, leading to systematic errors in determining the characteristics of the different galaxy classes. We propose a method to statistically correct the determination of galaxy properties' distributions accounting for the contamination caused by misclassified galaxies from other classes. Using a sample of massive clusters and galaxies in their surroundings taken from the MultiDark Planck 2 simulation combined with the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG, we compute the confusion matrix associated to a classification scheme in the PPSD. Based on positions in the PPSD, galaxies are classified as cluster members, backsplash galaxies, recent infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. This classification is determined using probabilities calculated by the code ROGER, along with a threshold criterion. By inverting the confusion matrix, we are able to get better determinations of distributions of galaxy properties such as colour. Compared to a direct estimation based solely on the predicted galaxy classes, our method provides better estimates of the mass-dependent colour distribution for the galaxy classes most affected by misclassification: cluster members, backsplash galaxies, and recent infallers. We apply the method to a sample of observed X-ray clusters and galaxies. Our method can be applied to any classification of galaxies in the PPSD, and to any other galaxy property besides colour, provided an estimation of the confusion matrix. Blue, low-mass galaxies in clusters are almost exclusively recent infaller galaxies that have not yet been quenched by the environmental action of the cluster. Backsplash galaxies are on average redder than expected.</description>

      <title>Impact of merger histories on the timing argument estimate of the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing argument (TA) aims to find the total mass of the Local Group (LG) from the relative motions of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda Galaxy (M31). However, the classical TA always overestimates the LG mass, presumably because it does not account for the hierarchical scenario and other interactions such as that with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We focus on the impact of the recent major merger at M31 by using three merger models to find the peculiar motion of M31 within the simple two-body and point-mass scenario of TA. We found that the merger correction may affect the TA mass by either plus or minus 10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large uncertainties. If we consider a M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA mass by 10-15% to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as reported in the literature, the TA mass would be found consistent with the LG mass from Hubble-Lemaitre flow. Galaxies are expected to experience about 16 major mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers have similar impact on the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass would be $0.85^{+0.65}_{-0.37}$ and such a TA mass is consistent with all the LG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with the findings using LG analogues in the cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited by the hierarchical scenario, since it not possible to track the progenitors of both MW and M31 through so many mergers. We conclude that the MW-M31 dynamical system is far too complex to be modelled as a simple two-body point mass system.</description>

Abstract: Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation &gt;1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (&gt;1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.</description>

      <title>The Effects of AGN Feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Flux Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of AGN feedback on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts ($z&lt;1$) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers ($1.5\times10^{-3}&lt;k&lt;10^{-1}$ s/km) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at $z \lesssim 1.0$. At higher redshifts ($z&gt;2.0$), AGN feedback has a $2\%$ effect on the P1D for $k&lt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km and an $8\%$ effect for $k&gt;5\times10^{-2}$ s/km. We show that the small scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the $z&gt;2$ Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.</description>

Abstract: We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB ($\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\sim$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies indicates a possible steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-5 GHz range. Optical observations performed with the LBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\sim$1 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with SFR $\sim 1 M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\sim10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>NLTE abundances of Eu for a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic Halo and Metal-poor Disk with 1D and &lt;3D&gt; models</title>

Abstract: Accurate measurements of europium abundances in cool stars are essential for an enhanced understanding of the r-process mechanisms. We measure the abundance of Eu in solar spectra and a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and metal-poor disk, with the metallicities ranging from \GG{$-2.4$} to $-0.5$ dex, using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation. We compare these measurements with Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models to \GG{explore the impact of the NLTE corrections on the contribution of r-process site in Galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we use NLTE line formation, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic and spatial averages of 3D hydrodynamical ($&lt;$3D$&gt;$) model atmospheres to measure the abundance of Eu based on both the Eu II 4129 \AA\ and Eu II 6645 \AA\ lines for solar spectra and metal-poor stars. We find that \GG{for Eu II 4129 \AA\ line the NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.04 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and higher (0.07 dex) in \GG{$&lt;$3D$&gt;$} NLTE while} NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.01 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and lower (0.03 dex) in \GG{$&lt;$3D$&gt;$} NLTE for Eu II 6645 \AA\ line. Although the NLTE corrections for the Eu II $\lambda$ 4129 \AA\ and Eu II $\lambda$ 6645 \AA\ lines are opposite, the discrepancy between the abundances derived from these individual lines reduces after applying NLTE corrections, highlighting the critical role of NLTE abundance determinations. By comparing these measurements with Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, we find that the \G{amount of NLTE correction does not require significant change of the parameters for Eu production} in the GCE models.</description>
