      <title>Facile Synthesis and On-Chip Color Tuning of CsPbBr$_{3}$@CsPbBr$_{3-x}$TFA$_{x}$ Nanoplatelets via Ion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive optoelectronic materials because of high fluorescence quantum yield, broad color tunability, and excellent color purity. However, the ionic nature of MHPs makes them susceptible to polar solvents, leading to defect-induced nonradiative recombination and photoluminescence (PL) quenching. Here, we present a combined in-synthesis ($\textit{in situ}$) and post-synthesis ion engineering to suppress nonradiative recombination and integrate multicolor MHP arrays on-chip through a perovskite-compatible photolithography process and $\textit{in situ}$ vapor-phase anion exchange. CsPbBr$_{3}$@CsPbBr$_{3-x}$TFA$_{x}$ nanoplatelets were grown on-chip via a single-step solution process incorporating trifluoroacetate (TFA$^{-}$) pseudohalides. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that TFA$^{-}$ passivate uncoordinated Pb$^{2+}$ ions on nanoplatelet surface and suppresses the formation of metallic lead (Pb$^{0}$). This decreases the non-radiative recombination centers and yields a PL peak at 520 nm with a linewidth of 14.56$\% \pm$ 0.5 nm. The nanoplatelets were patterned via a top-down photolithography process and selectively masked with a PMMA/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ stack to enable vapor-phase anion exchange. The PL peak shifted in the unmasked regions from 520 nm to 413 nm, resulting in distinct green and blue emission arrays. Our method enables the scalable fabrication of highly luminescent, two-color MHP arrays with tailored optical properties, advancing their integration into next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of mirror-odd and mirror-even spin texture in ultra-thin epitaxially-strained RuO2 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of &lt;10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts</description>

      <title>Prediction of Li3Fe8B8 compound with rapid one-dimensional ion diffusion channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a computational crystal structure search in the Li-Fe-B ternary system, we predict a stable phase of Li3Fe8B8, featuring 1D channels that enable rapid Li-ion transport. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the Li-ion diffusion coefficient in Li3Fe8B8 surpasses that of common electrode and conductive additive materials by several orders of magnitude. The high diffusion in Li3Fe8B8 can be explained by the Frenkel-Kontorova model, which describes an incommensurate state between the Li diffusion chain and the periodic potential field caused by the FeB backbone structure. The favorable lithium-ion diffusivity and mechanical properties of Li3Fe8B8 make it a promising conductive additive for battery materials. Its itinerant ferromagnetism also offers a platform for exploring correlated-electron magnetism and spin-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Melting point depression of charge density wave in 1T-TiSe$_2$ due to size effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nucleation theory predicts size-dependent nucleation and melting due to surface and confinement effects at the nanoscale. In correlated electronic states, observation of size-dependent nucleation and melting is rarely reported, likely due to the extremely small length scales necessary to observe such effects for electronic states. Here, using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) charge density wave (CDW) system, we perform in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K and observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs. Specifically, we observe a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, we estimate a zero-temperature correlation length of 10--50 nm, which matches the reported CDW domain size for 1T-TiSe$_2$. As the flake size approaches the correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and thereby lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size is close to the correlation length, we also observe absence of CDWs, as predicted by the model. We thus show that an electronic phase transition follows classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Ductile fracture of HDPE thin films: failure mechanisms and tuning of fracture properties by bonding a rubber layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) thin films, while inherently ductile, exhibit poor flaw tolerance. Our experiments show that they fail prematurely not at the point of maximum stretch, but at the boundary of a necked region or notch-tip plastic zone. This study investigates this counter-intuitive failure mechanism and demonstrates how an elastomeric interlayer can mitigate it to enhance toughness. Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched, pure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and HDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that failure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion. Instead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that depends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain. This damage localizes initially at the notch or neck center, but migrates into a "hotspot" at the neck/plastic zone boundary, matching the observed crack initiation site. The addition of a soft SEPS interlayer fundamentally alters this behavior by suppressing the ductile damage, causing the failure mechanism to switch from being damage-driven at the neck/plastic zone boundary to being stretch-driven at the notch tip. This switch enhances flaw tolerance and stretchability by relocating and delaying fracture initiation in both defect-free and notched geometries. This work exposes the failure mechanism in HDPE thin films and provides a mechanistically-grounded framework for toughening ductile polymers by manipulating the competition between damage and stretch localization.</description>

      <title>pyRMG: A Python Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell Real-Space MultiGrid DFT Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.</description>

      <title>Selective photocatalyitic CO2 reduction to acetic acid on chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply.Although acetic acid can be produced by prhotocatalytic CO2 redcution. Among other multicarbon products, it is typically a low-yieleded product due to competing reaction pathways and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 umolg-1h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3%. The yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity. The remarkable The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic cooperation between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on (102) crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction that could enable the synthesis and scalable production of various multicarbon products.</description>

      <title>Spin PN Junctions: Giant Magnetoresistance, Tunable Circular Polarization, and Spin Zener Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that spin PN junctions-magnetic semiconductor homojunctions with spin splitting-induced band offsets-fundamentally redefine carrier transport via spin-dependent recom bination probabilities. By integrating this mechanism into the Shockley model, we predict
  a near 100 enhancement in magnetoresistance sensitivity under small forward bias, where exponen tial modulation of recombination lifetimes by magnetic fields amplifies resistance changes.
  Angular momentum conservation enables magnetically tunable circularly polarized luminescence:
  exclusive conduction-band or valence-band splitting in both neutral regions achieves near-half po larization, while global splitting degrades emission coherence. Furthermore, we propose
  a "spin Zener filter" exploiting 1eV valence band splitting in (Ga, Mn)As, where spin-dependent
  barrier heights generate near 100% spin-polarized tunneling currents within a voltage-selective win dow. These results establish spin PN junctions as a universal design paradigm for magnetically
  amplified electronics, polarization-programmable optoelectronics, and voltage-gated spin injection
  without ferromagnetic contacts.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of Lead halide Janus layers -- A theoretical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials offer a promising route for efficient heat-to-power conversion. In search of materials functional at high and low operating temperatures, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional lead halide Janus layers (JLs) using density functional theory. The electronegativity difference between halides in JLs significantly modulates the electronic structure, particularly the strong Pb-F bonding in PbIF JLs leads to pronounced band curvature and a unique direct bandgap. Estimated through three-phonon interactions, the lattice thermal conductivity is intrinsically low, primarily due to acoustic phonon contributions and suppressed optical phonon transport. The thermoelectric coefficients are enhanced with carrier doping, resulting in figures of merit as high as 8.94 at room temperature and upto 36.31 at elevated temperatures. These findings establish two-dimensional lead halide Janus layers as exceptional candidates for thermoelectric conversion, and the insights into their elemental and electronic characteristics offer a valuable basis for the future design of high-performance lead-based thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic nonreciprocity of light emission in CuB$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity of light emission, when the radiation intensity differs for two opposite propagation directions, is a rare phenomenon in solids because it requires a violation of the crystal symmetry with respect to time-reversal. Such violation via time-reversal symmetry breaking can occur either due to an applied magnetic field or due to a magnetic ordering. We perform a detailed theoretical and experimental study of the photoluminescence (PL) nonreciprocity in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal antiferromagnet CuB$_2$O$_4$, where this effect reaches 80\% below the N\'eel phase transition temperature of $T_N = 20$~K. The effect is observed for three sets of extremely narrow exciton and exciton-magnon PL lines, associated with Frenkel excitons on the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the magnetic $4b$ subsystem. A strong manifestation of the nonreciprocity of emission is found in certain geometries for the commensurate antiferromagnetic phase, as well as in other phases with incommensurate spin ordering. In accordance with the magnetic symmetry of CuB$_2$O$_4$, the nonreciprocity of emission is observed for light propagation along certain directions within the easy (001) plane. A rigorous quantum-mechanical analysis of the wave functions of the initial and final states of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions responsible for the PL is performed for various experimental geometries of the crystallographic axes and the applied magnetic field. The analysis confirms that the nonreciprocity of emission from Frenkel excitons in CuB$_2$O$_4$ is due to the interference of magnetic-dipole and electric-dipole transitions of antiferromagnetically ordered $4b$ spins of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions, in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

In contrast to the lamellar structure of standard hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) covering the metal ingot, the current synthetized BN shell is composed of many triangular bulk crystallites, of submillimeter size, predominantly in the rhombohedral phase, with only weak traces of hBN detected by high resolution X-ray diffraction. The low-temperature photoluminescence emission confirms the excellent quality of the rhombohedral stacking with unprecedented width for all phonon replicas at the band edge. The Raman spectra are characterized by the absence of any low-energy modes at $\sim50$ cm$^{-1}$, the presence of an extended band around $800$ cm$^{-1}$ and an asymmetric high energy mode at $1366$ cm$^{-1}$. These observations are in very good agreement with the phonon dispersion calculated for the rhombohedral primitive cell with $C_{3v}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Influence of carbon dioxide and water concentration on terbium thin films produced by Molecular Plating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terbium and thulium thin films were produced by Molecular Plating under controlled conditions to elucidate a possible influence of water and carbon dioxide present in the plating solution. Platings were made in a glovebox with variable concentration of residual water and \ce{CO2} in a controlled inert atmosphere to study the impact on the quality of the produced thin films and on deposition yields. The morphology of the thin films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The deposition yield was determined by neutron activation analysis at the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. Chemical analysis of the deposited layers was conducted using a combination of infrared, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Raman and IR spectra reveal the formation of hydroxides, oxides and carbonates. Water in the plating solution affects the quality of the thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-\%. The presence of \ce{CO2} leads to an increased carbonate content, which negatively influences the film quality</description>

      <title>$\texttt{DiffSyn}$: A Generative Diffusion Approach to Materials Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose $\texttt{DiffSyn}$, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using $\texttt{DiffSyn}$-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant absolute quantification of electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystalline solids, including the familiar electric dipole density in ferroelectrics and the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, are of central importance for our understanding of ordered phases in matter. However, determining the magnitude of these quantities has proven to be conceptually and technically difficult. Here we present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including Landau order parameters.</description>

      <title>Protection of metal interfaces against hydrogen-assisted cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling a hydrogen economy requires the development of materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). More than 100 years of research have led to several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to hydrogen-induced interfacial failure</description>

      <title>Magnetically Enhanced Thermoelectric Effect Driven by Martensitic Transformation in the Weak Itinerant Ferromagnet Co$_2$NbSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler alloy Co$_2$NbSn, which exhibits a martensitic transformation at 240 K. Magnetization measurements reveal weak itinerant ferromagnetism in the martensitic phase, which is well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory. The characteristic spin fluctuation parameters were estimated to be T_0 = 1.0$\times$10^3 K and T_A = 7.2$\times$10^3 K. Seebeck coefficient measurements under magnetic fields up to 9 T show complex temperature and field dependence, which we decomposed into electron diffusion, spin fluctuation drag, and magnon drag components. A significant magnon-drag contribution was identified in both austenite and martensitic phases. Remarkably, this contribution is strongly enhanced in the martensitic phase compared to the austenite phase, despite a smaller magnetic moment. These findings provide evidence for robust low-energy spin excitations and highlight the potential of martensitic transformation in enhancing the thermoelectric performance of itinerant ferromagnetic alloys.</description>

      <title>Tracking four-dimensional atomic evolutions of single nanocatalysts throughout the life cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural changes induced by chemical reactions critically determine the catalytic performance and mechanism. However, precise tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic nanocatalysts remains challenging. Here we develop four-dimensional electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles by electrocatalytic reactions. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a model system, we capture the atomic evolution of single nanocatalysts throughout electrocatalytic cycles. We observe two stages of evolutions: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, which are corroborated with the voltage-dependent behaviors probed by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. We identify chemical short-range order at atomic level and further reveal anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into the rational design of functional nanocatalysts in the future.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Curie Temperature of Magnetic Materials with Machine Learning: Descriptor Engineering, Graph Neural Networks, and the Role of Curated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of magnetic materials is crucial for advancing applications in data storage, spintronics, and sensors. We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ using a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement, with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$ score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing $T_\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to 0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials. Our curated dataset is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Delta-Doped Diamond via in-situ Plasma-Distance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Measurements and scaling of X-ray total scattering from single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement protocol and a data reduction workflow for obtaining single-crystal X-ray total-scattering datasets that capture both Bragg-peak and diffuse scattering intensities on an absolute (electrons2/atom) scale. We further demonstrate that the intensity scale factor derived from crystallographic refinements using Bragg peaks is in close agreement with that obtained by matching the scattering function, computed via spherical integration of the 3D total scattering signal, to the theoretical coherent baseline, calculated as the spherical average of the Debye-Waller factor. The latter approach can be applied to diffuse scattering without including Bragg peaks. Our results set the ground for structural refinements using large atomic configurations while simultaneously fitting Bragg intensities and diffuse scattering from a single crystal. Moreover, with the convergence between the two scaling methods, the Bragg and diffuse components can be obtained from the same total-scattering dataset, as achieved in this work, or measured independently.</description>

      <title>Melanin-Based Compounds as Low-Cost Sensors for Nitroaromatics: Theoretical Insights on Molecular Interactions and Optoelectronic Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are used in various industrial applications including dyes, inks, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives. Due to their toxicity and environmental persistence, reliable detection and monitoring methods are required. Hybrid organic--inorganic structures have shown potential for NAC sensing; however, their complex synthesis, high processing costs, and limited reproducibility hinder practical implementation, highlighting the need for simpler and more accessible materials. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to evaluate the electronic, optical, and reactive properties of two melanin-based oligomeric systems, aiming to assess their potential use as NAC detectors. Our results indicate the potential of these materials to detect a series of nitroaromatic compounds such as 2,4-DNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, TNP, and TNT by electrical and infrared optical measurements. Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations reveal the thermal stability of the adsorption process, confirming effective substrate--analyte interaction under different temperature conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this compound has not been proposed for sensing applications. Its low cost and facile synthesis make it a promising candidate for the development of environmentally friendly organic NAC sensors.</description>

      <title>Design, synthesis, and physical properties of the intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$. Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} = 29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Spin-Seebeck Signatures of Spin Chirality in Kagome Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 4%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.</description>

Abstract: This work explores the role of oxygen in industrial methane oxidation. Oxygen, a well-known oxidizing agent, drives CH$_4$ conversion to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. We report how oxygen influences oxidation on single Pd and PdO clusters supported on CeO$_2$(111). Oxygen is introduced by (1) lattice O in PdO and (2) O$_2$ adsorption on an isolated Pd atom, forming PdO$_x$ clusters. Density-functional theory (DFT) mapped multiple reaction pathways on the Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111) surface; both Pd and PdO clusters were found to thermodynamically favour methane activation. The computed barrier for CH$_4$ activation is 0.63 eV on PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111). A single Pd atom markedly accelerates O$_2$ dissociation to PdO$_2$, and the presence of lattice oxygen lowers this barrier by 0.36 eV relative to an oxygen-deficient surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Reaction selectivity, coverage-dependent production rates, degree of rate control (DRC), and intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) were quantified through steady-state microkinetic modelling. The simulations predict full conversion of CH$_4$ to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O above 600 K, whereas partial-oxidation intermediates dominate at lower temperature and high O coverage. Rate constants for all elementary steps were derived via the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression method, yielding a concise predictive expression based on charge, coordination number, and key Pd-O/C-H distances. These combined DFT-microkinetic-SISSO results clarify oxygen's mechanistic participation and provide practical guidelines for designing Pd/CeO$_2$ catalysts with improved activity toward methane oxidation, a reaction of pressing environmental and industrial importance.</description>

      <title>How Realistic are Idealized Copper Surfaces? A Machine Learning Study of Rough Copper-Water Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper is a highly promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO2RR) since it is the only pure metal that can form highly added-value products such as ethylene and ethanol. Since the CO2RR takes place in aqueous solution, the detailed atomic structure of the water-copper interface is essential for unraveling the key reaction mechanisms. In this study, we investigate copper-water interfaces exhibiting nanometer-scale roughnesses. We introduce two molecular dynamics protocols to create rough copper surfaces, which are subsequently brought into contact with water. From these interfaces, we sample additional training configurations from machine-learning-interatomic-potential-driven molecular dynamics simulations containing hundreds of thousands of atoms. An active learning workflow is developed to identify regions with high spatially resolved uncertainty and convert them into DFT-feasible cells through a modified amorphous matrix embedding approach. Finally, we analyze the local environments at the interface using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. Unique environments emerge on the rough copper surfaces absent from model systems, including stacking-fault-induced configurations and undercoordinated corner atoms. Notably, corner atoms consistently feature chemisorbed water molecules in our simulations, indicating their potential importance in catalytic processes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach to Predict Curie Temperature in Binary Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the Curie temperature in binary alloys, specifically focusing on the Fe-Pt, Fe-Ni, Fe-Pd, and Co-Pt compounds within a concentration range of 10 to 90 atomic percent. The optimal mathematical algorithm for this task is the Voting Ensemble algorithm, which combines the predictions from multiple individual models to produce a final prediction. The results are validated against classical methods for calculating Curie temperatures. The experimental findings indicate that factors such as external pressure, atomic ordering, and alloy composition have a significant influence on the Curie temperatures in all examined binary systems. These factors can be leveraged to design alloys with specific Curie temperatures. Moreover, the proposed features, feature analysis algorithms, and computational methods pave the way for advancements across various materials, including ternary alloys, bulk materials, and nanomaterials, inspiring innovation in the field.</description>

      <title>The Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) Dataset and Models for Solid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/\r{A}, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Direct identification of local doping effects in Barium-hexaferrite by electron vortex beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate atomic-scale mapping of local magnetic moments and doping effects in Ti-doped barium hexaferrite (BaFe11TiO19) using atom-sized electron vortex beams (EVBs) with controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) in a scanning transmission electron microscope. By measuring electron energy loss magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) at the Fe-L2,3 edges, we directly resolve the spatial distribution of antiparallel-aligned magnetic sublattices and quantify the impact of non-magnetic Ti4+ substitution. The EMCD signal, detected from single atomic Fe columns, reveals a marked reduction and sign reversal in the magnetic moment at Ti-rich 4f2 sites, corroborated by inelastic scattering simulations and density functional theory calculations that indicate induced Fe2+ formation and modified exchange interactions. Our results show that EVBs enable direct, element-specific, and atomically resolved magnetic characterization, opening new avenues for investigating local magnetic phenomena and dopant effects in nano-structured magnetic materials, such as those used in spintronic devices. This method paves the way for detailed studies of complex spin textures, magnetic interfaces, and dynamic processes at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>MIM-Diode-Like Rectification in Lateral 1T/1H/1T-MoS$_2$ Homojunctions via Interfacial Dipole Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral two-dimensional (2D) tunnel diodes that reproduce metal-insulator-metal (MIM)-diode-like rectification without using dissimilar contacts are attractive for scalable nanoelectronics. MoS$_2$ can exist in both the semiconducting 1H phase and the metallic 1T phase, enabling phase-engineered homojunctions within a single material. First-principles electronic structure and quantum transport calculations show that phase-engineered 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ homojunctions exhibit pronounced MIM-diode-like rectification originating from interfacial charge transfer at asymmetric 1T/1H interfaces. The charge transfer establishes interface dipole steps that impose a built-in potential drop across the 1H barrier, thereby generating a trapezoidal tunnel barrier at zero bias. In contrast, symmetric 1T/1H interfaces do not form interface dipoles and show no rectification. To clarify the microscopic origin, a lateral graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene junction is analyzed as a minimal MIM diode analogue with a simple interface and well-defined barrier, confirming that interface-induced dipoles, rather than work-function difference, enable the effect. The mechanism operates entirely within a single monolayer material system and does not rely on out-of-plane stacking, highlighting compatibility with phase patterning in 2D semiconductors. These results establish lateral 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ as a fully 2D, single-material platform for MIM-diode-like rectification and position interface-dipole engineering as a general strategy for ultrathin in-plane diodes, high-frequency detectors, and energy-harvesting tunnel devices.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-Pulsed Nanocalorimetry: A Scalable Approach for Ultrasensitive Heat Capacity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nanocalorimetric technique based on microsecond-pulsed heating (\mu s-PHnC) that enables high-sensitivity, quasi-isothermal heat capacity measurements on nanoscale samples. Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetic and Electronic Properties of Double Perovskite La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$ double perovskite series serves as an effective platform for investigating the evolution of magnetic and electronic properties as a function of chemical pressure (doping) or hydrostatic pressure due to the interplay between the electrons correlation and spin-orbit coupling. In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure.First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\% for $x =$ 0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways.</description>

      <title>Estimating Energy Release in Metallized Composite Explosives Using the Taylor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales. The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used. Qualitative agreement is observed between the model and previously published experiments.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Rashba response in ferroelectric polarized PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) with spintronic emitters as a source have revealed distinct signatures of the Rashba effect. This effect, which arises from the breaking of inversion symmetry in low-dimensional materials, has been recently investigated in CoFeB/PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$-based heterostructures [S. Massabeau et al., APL Mater. 13, 041102, 2025 ]. The observed phenomena are at the source of the generated THz far-field emission, typically through mechanisms such as spin-to-charge conversion triggered by the absorption of ultrafast optical pulses. In this work, we employ first-principles simulations to quantify the Rashba effect at PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$ interfaces, expanding the traditional understanding of spin transport by incorporating the orbital degree of freedom. Moreover, we quantify the degree of control on the THz emission depending on the polarization direction of LiNbO$_3$. In order to achieve this, we analyze the accumulation of both spin and orbital components using linear response theory, revealing distinct behaviors. These findings are crucial for a deeper understanding of the physical processes governing angular momentum-to-charge conversion and THz emission. Moreover, they may provide broader insights into various experimental outcomes, including those related to spin-orbit torque.</description>

      <title>Joint commensuration in moir\'e charge-order superlattices drives shear topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional moir\'e systems has revolutionized the exploration of phenomena arising from strong correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, a moir\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been realized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability, resulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena including electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds promise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such functionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence, and amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these questions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced dynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under intense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain locked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\'e periodicity while the moir\'e potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the configuration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of previously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we developed an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the amplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding to one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and electron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum- and time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of shear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the unique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform for optical moir\'e engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through topological defect control.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable chiral spin mode in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e superlattices</title>

Abstract: The interplay between many-body and spin-orbit effects (SOC) can lead to novel phenomena in solids. Chiral spin modes (CSM) are collective spin excitations that arise from such interplay and connect states with opposite chirality, which, however, have been rarely observed. Here, we report a gate-tunable CSM that occurs between conduction SOC-split minibands in near-0{\deg}-twisted WSe2/WS2 bilayers. This mode manifests as a sharp resonance with giant Raman efficiency in the pseudovector-symmetry channel of the Raman spectra. By varying fillings, the CSM transitions from chiral spin exciton to excitonic polaron. The spin-flip nature is directly confirmed by the Zeeman effect. Moreover, the filling dependence compellingly evidences a charge-transfer insulator at filling of one. Our results demonstrate transition-metal-dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices as a fertile platform for exploring exotic low-lying collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Insights into the Switching Mechanisms of RRAM Devices</title>

Abstract: The growing energy demands of information and communication technologies, driven by data-intensive computing and the von Neumann bottleneck, underscore the need for energy-efficient alternatives. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have emerged as promising candidates for beyond von Neumann computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, offering voltage-history-dependent switching that mimics synaptic and neural behaviors. Atomic-scale mechanisms, such as defect-driven filament formation and ionic transport, govern these switching processes. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of Tantalum Oxide based RRAM devices featuring both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient switching layers. We analyze the dominant conduction mechanisms underpinning resistive switching and systematically evaluate how oxygen stoichiometry influences device behavior. Leveraging a bottom-up design methodology, we link material composition to electrical performance metrics-such as endurance, cycle-to-cycle variability, and multilevel resistance states-providing actionable guidelines for optimizing RRAM architectures for energy-efficient memory and computing applications.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Atomistic Learning for "Clusters-to-Bulk" Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Much ado about MOFs: Metal-Organic-Frameworks as Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. Particularly for magnetism, their modular chemistry enables extensive control over magnetic interactions, spin magnitudes, lattice geometries, and even light-responsiveness, making them a uniquely adaptable platform. However, despite their promise, their low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we believe that MOFs and particularly {\it magnetic} MOFs offer a vast and largely untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Low-Noise Nanoscale Vortex Sensor for Out-of-Plane Magnetic Field Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a vortex sensor based on a nanoscale (sub-100 nm) magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with a strong shape anisotropy, designed for sensitivity to the out-of-plane magnetic field component ($H_z$). The sensor comprises a free layer with a vortex configuration and a perpendicularly magnetized reference layer, which provides a reproducible and linear response when excited by a perpendicular magnetic field. Experimental measurements and micromagnetic simulations were combined to systematically assess the influence of structural parameters, specifically aspect ratio and defect landscape, on key sensor performance metrics, including dynamic range, sensitivity, and detectivity. The out-of-plane vortex sensor demonstrates a significantly improved dynamic range exceeding 200 mT, compared to the 40-80 mT typical of conventional in-plane vortex sensors. Frequency-dependent noise measurements reveal that the sensor exhibits low intrinsic noise, along with improved detectivity and resolution. This performance is ascribed to the field-dependent expansion and contraction of the vortex core, which reduces Barkhausen-type noise caused by defect-induced pinning potentials. Moreover, the sub-100\,nm lateral dimensions of the sensor enable scalable array integration, providing further enhancements in noise and detectivity through collective averaging. These results underscore the potential of this sensor architecture for advanced magnetic field sensing applications requiring a wide dynamic range and high measurement accuracy at the same time.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck effect in two-sublattice ferrimagnets in the vicinity of $T_{\rm C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin Seebeck effect refers to the magnonic thermal spin injection from a magnet into the adjacent heavy metal. A ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the material most studied for the spin Seebeck effect. Here, to account for a convex downward temperature dependence of the spin Seebeck effect observed in YIG/Pt system near the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin Seebeck effect in two-sublattice ferrimagnets. We find that only when we take into account the ``N\'{e}el coupling'', i.e., interfacial exchange coupling between the N\'{e}el order parameter of YIG and spin accumulation of Pt, the convex downward temperature dependence is explained. The present result sheds light on the importance of the N\'{e}el coupling in ferrimagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum metric of 3D topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is the Berry curvature, which controls electric frequency doubling via a higher order moment, called Berry curvature triple. In addition to the Berry curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport. However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed in 3D topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that is independent of temperature and disorder below 30 K and is thus of intrinsic geometrical origin. Our measurements demonstrate the existence of quantum geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide strategies for designing novel functionalities in topological devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fresnel Wave Surfaces: Off-Shell Photonic Density of States and Near-Fields in Isotropy-Broken Materials with Loss or Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fresnel wave surfaces, or isofrequency light shells, provide a powerful framework for describing electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic media, yet their applicability is restricted to reciprocal, lossless materials and far-field radiation. This paper extends the concept by incorporating near-field effects and non-Hermitian responses arising in media with loss, gain, or non-reciprocity. Using the Om-potential approach to macroscopic electromagnetism, we reinterpret near fields as off-shell electromagnetic modes, in analogy with off-shell states in quantum field theory. We show that photonic density of states (PDOS) distributions near Fresnel surfaces acquire Lorentzian broadening in non-reciprocal media, directly linking this effect to the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law of exponential attenuation or amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Abraham and Minkowski momenta, locked to light shells in the far field, naturally shift to characterize source structures in the near-field regime. This unified treatment bridges the gap between sources and radiation, on-shell and off-shell modes, and reciprocal and non-reciprocal responses. The framework provides both fundamental insight into structured light and practical tools for the design of emitters and metamaterial platforms relevant to emerging technologies such as 6G communications, photonic density-of-states engineering, and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Functions of the Gr{\"u}neisen Ratio near Quantum Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gr\"uneisen ratio, defined as $\Gamma_g \equiv (1/T) (\partial T/\partial g)_S$, serves as a highly sensitive probe for detecting quantum critical points (QCPs) driven by an external feild $g$ and for characterizing the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). Near a QCP, the Gr\"uneisen ratio displays a universal divergence which is governed by a universality-class-dependent scaling function stemming from the scale invariance. In this work, we systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Gr\"uneisen ratio in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems, including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\"uneisen ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature refrigeration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encapsulation protects functional layers, ensuring structural stability and improving the quality of assembled van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we develop a model that describes lattice relaxation in twisted bilayers accounting for encapsulation effects, incorporated via a single parameter characterizing rigidity of encapsulation material interfaces. By analysing the twist-angle dependence of weak-to-strong lattice relaxation transition in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers, we show that increasing interface rigidity raises the crossover twist angle between the two relaxation regimes. Furthermore, tuning this rigidity parameter allows to achieve a good agreement with existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Topical review: the nature of the ground state and possibility of a quantum spin liquid in 1T metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Nitric Oxide in Trigeminal Neuralgia Rats with a Cerium Single-Atom Nanozyme Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Same-group element replacement enhances superconductivity in clathrate-like YH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: H3S, LaH10, and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of Yttrium (Y) by Scandium (Sc), Lanthanum (La), and Zirconium (Zr). Pure YH4, stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature (Tc) of 84-95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases Tc to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed Tc of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y-H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance Tc in hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>The Roadmap of New Capabilities of High-Intensity Lasers in Material Design and Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the current trends of laser applications in material science is using high-intensity lasers to provide fast and efficient surface or volume modifications for achieving controllable material properties, synthesis of novel materials with desired functionalities, and upscaling laser technologies with industry-demanded throughputs. Depending on the parameters, lasers can offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step, high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared) semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users high-intensity beam time, will be given.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Electrostatics and Boundary Charges in Continuum Limits of Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials are of significant technological interest due to their exceptional properties and broad applicability in engineering. The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable configurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of multiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at larger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and near-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant spatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density field -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell -- is used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly oscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are much larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling.
  In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the charge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of problems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the continuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much smaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing. These limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms of the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further, we demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of polarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total electrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding energy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined.</description>

Abstract: Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

Abstract: Unusual magnetotransport behaviors, such as temperature-dependent negative magnetoresistance (MR) and bowtie-shaped MR, have puzzled us for a long time. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, the absence of comprehensive quantitative calculations has made these explanations less convincing. In our work, we introduce a methodology to study magnetotransport behaviors in magnetic materials. This approach integrates the anomalous Hall conductivity induced by the Berry curvature, with a multi-band ordinary conductivity tensor, employing a combination of first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our method also incorporates the temperature dependence of the relaxation time and the anomalous Hall conductivity, as well as the field dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity. We initially test this approach on models, obtaining distinct behaviors of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity across several types of magnetic materials, and then apply it to a Weyl semimetal, Co3Sn2S2. The results, which align well with experimental observations in terms of magnetic field and temperature dependencies, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This methodology provides a comprehensive and efficient means to understand the underlying mechanisms of the unusual complex behaviors observed in magnetotransport measurements in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Complex field-, temperature-, and angle-dependent Hall effects from intrinsic Fermi surface revealed by first-principles calculations</title>

Abstract: The Hall effect, ever intriguing since its discovery, has spurred the exploration of its phenomena, intensified by advances in topology and novel materials. Differentiating the ordinary Hall effect from extraordinary properties like the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is challenging, especially in materials with topological origins. In our study, we leverage semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and first-principles calculations within the relaxation time approximation to analyze Hall effects comprehensively. We have found that the complex magnetic field dependence of ordinary Hall effect, including the sign reversals, appearing of plateau and nonlinearity, can be understood and reproduced by our approach both for multiband models and realistic topological materials of ZrSiS and PtTe2. The Hall resistivity versus temperature and magnetic fields can be well scaled, similar to Kohler's rule for longitudinal resistivity. This methodology can also accurately model the angular dependent Hall effects such as planar Hall effects of bismuth. These findings indicate that the dependencies of various Hall effects and magnetoresistance on magnetic fields are mainly determined by the details of Fermi surface and the relaxation time. The intrinsic Fermi surface determines the carriers' density, type, and velocity, while the later is mostly influenced by extrinsic factors, such as quality of sample with defects, impurities, and domains. This insight might simplify the understanding of several seemingly complex transport phenomena in nonmagnetic materials, with no need for hypotheses of other sophisticated mechanisms, such as magnetization-induced AHE, Lifshitz transition-induced changes in carrier type, exotic orders like charge density wave, or some delicate scattering of carriers with chiral or nonreciprocal dependence. Finally, we also discussed the Hall effects contribute from the Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Point defect design in (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ -- an insight on agglomeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10467v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of the monolayer MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.</description>

      <title>Experimental Exchange Interaction Dataset for Magnetic Materials: Spin Waves to MC Simulations</title>

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) provides direct insights into microscopic magnetic interactions in crystalline materials, making it a valuable experimental technique in condensed matter physics and materials science. These interactions can be extracted by fitting spin wave dispersions to Heisenberg Hamiltonians using spin wave theory. However, such datasets are scattered across the literature and lack a standardized format, which limits their accessibility, reproducibility, and utility. In this work, we compile and standardize exchange interaction data obtained from INS experiments on nearly 100 magnetic materials. The resulting dataset includes exchange parameters expressed in a unified Heisenberg model format, visualizations of crystal structures with annotated exchange pathways, and Monte Carlo simulation files generated using the ESpinS code. We use these experimentally derived exchange interactions to compute magnetic transition temperatures ($T_c$) via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the $(S+1)/S$ correction in the simulations and find it improves agreement with experimental $T_c$ values in most cases. All data and related resources are openly available through a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17532v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</description>

Abstract: We present a first-principles study based on density functional theory (DFT) on the electronic and structural properties of Ta2NiSe5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide that has been considered as a possible candidate for an excitonic insulator. Our systematic DFT results however provide a non-excitonic mechanism for the experimentally observed electronic and structural phase transitions in Ta2NiSe5, in particular explaining why sulfur substitution of selenium reduces the distortion angle in the low-temperature phase and potassium dosing closes the gap in the electronic structure. Moreover, the calculations show that these two effects couple to each other. Further, our first-principles calculations predict several changes in both the crystal structure and electronic structure under the effects of uniform charge dosing and uniaxial strain, which could be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to high remnant polarization compared with Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 and doped-HfO2 material systems, as well as their fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As AlScN films are thinned to 10 nm thickness, coercive field has been shown to substantially increase, which hinders low voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase with scaling and improves ferroelectric performance. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, the difference in dynamic switching behavior over a decade of frequency was evaluated by applying the KAI model. At frequencies lower than 16.7 kHz, the capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents of 0.030 and 0.028, indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent of 0.063, indicating a stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.030, suggesting a lower frequency dependence during faster switching scenarios. The Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction technique was selected to measure the strain difference in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, providing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain and switching behavior in ultra-thin film systems.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>Modeling phase transformations in Mn-rich disordered rocksalt cathodes with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mn-rich disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials exhibit a phase transformation from a disordered to a partially disordered spinel-like structure ($\delta$-phase) during electrochemical cycling. In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously suggested. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures at low voltage. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.</description>

By combining double-pulse excitation and time-resolved second harmonic generation techniques under high-density electronic excitation in a 2D layered material, WTe$_{2}$, we demonstrate that the lattice symmetry switching from the Weyl semimetallic T$_{d}$ to the semimetallic 1T$^{\prime}$ phases is independent of the amplitude of the coherent interlayer shear phonons after the arrival of the second pump pulse. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms for symmetry switching that electronic excitation-driven shear sliding plays a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Elemental Frequency-Based Supervised Classification Approach for the Search of Novel Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The machine learning based approaches efficiently solve the goal of searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have verified the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property screening of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Pristine and transition metal doped 2D AlSb as high performance electrocatalyst for selective CO2 reduction: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Fe-Ni phase diagram and the Earth's inner core structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fe-Ni alloy is believed to be the main component of Earth's core. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of phase equilibria near the melting point of this alloy under core conditions is still lacking, leaving the effect of nickel inconclusive. Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological wire in a topological vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>X-ray free-electron laser observation of giant and anisotropic magnetostriction in $\beta$-O$_{2}$ at 110 Tesla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where a considerable magnetostriction is expected. However, the microscopic observation of the magnetostriction above 100 T has been hindered due to the short pulse duration of $\mu$-seconds and the coil's destruction. Here, we report the observation of the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim 1$ % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal, $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the newly developed portable 100 T generator (PINK-02). The very soft and anisotropic response of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ should originate in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, and also the frustration of spin and lattice on the triangular network. The XFEL experiment above 100 T using PINK-02 enables microscopic investigations on materials' properties at high magnetic fields, providing insights into how spins contribute to the stability of crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims, while operationalizing feasibility assessment as a temporally-filtered claim verification task using backtesting. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.</description>

      <title>PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. The tool is also highly interactive and customizable, allowing the user to perform deployment simulations of kirigami structures under different environmental setups and material properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>CbLDM: A Diffusion Model for recovering nanostructure from pair distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Exciton Magnetic Moment: Interaction and Topological Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum phenomena and is emerging as a platform for quantum information science. Yet, the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in semiconductors, remains incomplete due to insufficient treatment of electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene, for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.</description>
