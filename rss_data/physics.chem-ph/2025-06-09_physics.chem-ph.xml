      <title>A neural network-based four-body potential energy surface for parahydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an isotropic ab initio (para-H$_2$)$_4$ four-body interaction potential energy surface (PES). The electronic structure calculations are performed at the correlated coupled-cluster theory level, with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. They use an atom-centred augmented correlation-consistent double zeta basis set, supplemented by a $(3s3p2d)$ midbond function. We use a multilayer perceptron to construct the PES. We apply a rescaling transformation to the output energies during training to improve the prediction of weaker energies in the sample data. At long distances, the interaction energies are adjusted to match the empirically-derived four-body dispersion interaction. The four-body interaction energy at short intermolecular separations is net repulsive. The use of this four-body PES, in combination with a first principles pair potential for para-H$_2$ [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 12551 (2015)], and an isotropic ab initio three-body potential for para-H$_2$ [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 044301 (2022)], is expected to provide closer agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Path-integral Monte Carlo simulations of solid parahydrogen using two-body, three-body, and four-body ab initio interaction potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present path integral Monte Carlo simulation results for the equation of state of solid parahydrogen between $ 0.024 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $ and $ 0.1 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $ at $ T = 4.2 \, $ K. The simulations are performed using non-additive isotropic ab initio two-body, three-body, and four-body potential energy surfaces (PES). We apply corrections to account for both the finite size simulation errors and the Trotter factorization errors. Simulations that use only the two-body PES during sampling yield an equation of state similar to that of simulations that use both the two-body and three-body PESs during sampling. With the four-body interaction energy, we predict an equilibrium density of $ 0.02608 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $, very close to the experimental result of $ 0.0261 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $. The inclusion of the four-body interaction energy also brings the simulation results in excellent agreement with the experimental pressure-density data until around $ 0.065 \, {\r{A}}^{-3} $, beyond which the simulation results overestimate the pressure. These PESs overestimate the average kinetic energy per molecule at the equilibrium density by about $ 7 \% $ compared to the experimental result. Our findings suggest that, at higher densities, we require five-body and higher-order many-body interactions to quantitatively improve the agreement between the pressure-density curve produced by simulations, and that of experiment. Using the four-body PES during sampling at excessively high densities, where such higher-order many-body interactions are likely to be significant, causes an artificial symmetry breaking in the hcp lattice structure of the solid.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Phase Transition: The Heartcore of Modern Energy Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk electrochemical phase transitions (EPTs) are the cornerstone of most modern electrochemical technologies, underlying many energy storage and electrocatalytic systems. Nonetheless, the fundamental mechanisms governing EPTs remain only partially understood because they involve complex interactions between phase transitions and electrochemical reactions. In this perspective, we first introduce the thermodynamics of EPTs based on the general framework of phase transitions and mixtures, followed by a discussion of their electrochemical kinetics. Finally, using recent insights from the Ni(OH)2 and LiFePO4 electrode materials, we highlight reaction hysteresis and asymmetry that challenge conventional electrochemical models. This perspective aims to inspire new fundamental research into EPTs and a fresh outlook on solid-state electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in Hydrothermal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter overviews sulfur chemical speciation and behavior in different types of hydrothermal fluids across the lithosphere, spanning from active geothermal systems to basinal brines, to metamorphic and magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The information on sulfur in these fluids stems from a wide range of recent analytical, experimental and computational methods whose advantages and limitations are discussed. A special emphasis is given to in situ approaches that have enabled unprecedented insights into the fascinating sulfur chemistry in hydrothermal fluids. These insights motivated a critical review of the chemical speciation of key base, precious, and critical metals whose behavior is intimately linked to sulfur. The results allow the role played by the different sulfur ligands on hydrothermal transport of metals and ore deposit formation to be evaluated. An outline of major challenges and emerging perspectives for sulfur-related research in geological fluids ends up this chapter.</description>

      <title>The influence of multi-dimensionality and off-diagonal non-Markovian friction coupling on coarse-grained dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-graining complex molecular systems to lower-dimensional reaction coordinates is a powerful approach for capturing their effective dynamics. The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) provides an exact framework for modeling coarse-grained dynamics, and is particularly useful when non-Markovian effects are significant. While one-dimensional GLE models are commonly used, many systems require multi-dimensional reaction coordinates to account for coupled dynamics. Here, we study the GLE formalism for multi-dimensional reaction coordinates, incorporating a memory matrix to quantify non-Markovian frictional coupling between coordinates, and a multi-dimensional potential. Using the GLE model, in conjunction with a multi-dimensional Markovian embedding scheme, we investigate different systems that are characterized by two-dimensional reaction coordinates, namely the dihedral dynamics of pentane and alanine dipeptide, obtained from molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. We identify significant off-diagonal friction couplings arising from intramolecular and hydrodynamic interactions. Unlike previous studies, our results highlight the critical role of different terms in the multi-dimensional GLE in accurately capturing key dynamical properties, including mean first-passage times and mean-squared displacements, particularly in systems with coupled non-Markovian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Redundant parameter dependencies in truncated classic and quantum Linear Response and Equation of Motion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting molecular properties from a wave function can be done through the linear response (LR) formalism or, equivalently, the equation of motion (EOM) formalism. For a simple model system, He in a 6-31G basis, it is here shown that calculated excitation energies depend on the specifically chosen orbitals, even when the ground-state is the FCI solution, if the LR is truncated to a singles expansion. This holds for naive, projected, self-consistent, and state-transfer parametrizations of the LR operators. With a focus on the state-transfer parameterization, this problem is shown to also hold for more complicated systems, and is also present when the LR is truncated to singles and doubles. This problem can be alleviated by performing a ground-state constrained trace optimization of the Hessian matrix before performing the LR calculation. It is finally shown that spectra can be further improved for small LR expansions by targeting only a few states in the constrained trace optimization using constrained state-averaged UCC.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Reaction Dynamics of O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature atom exchange and dissociation reaction dynamics of the O($^3$P) + O$_2(^3\Sigma_g^{-} )$ system are investigated based on a new reproducing kernel-based representation of high-level multi-reference configuration interaction energies. Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) simulations find the experimentally measured negative tempe-rature-dependence of the rate for the exchange reaction and describe the experiments within error bars. Similarly, QCT simulations for a recent potential energy surface (PES) at a comparable level of quantum chemical theory reproduce the negative $T-$dependence. Interestingly, both PESs feature a ``reef" structure near dissociation which has been implicated to be responsible for a positive $T-$dependence of the rate inconsistent with experiments. For the dissociation reaction the $T-$dependence correctly captures that known from experiments but underestimates the absolute rates by two orders of magnitude. Accounting for an increased number of accessible electronic states reduces this to one order of magnitude. A neural network-based state-to-distribution model is constructed for both PESs and shows good performance in predicting final translational, vibrational, and rotational product state distributions. Such models are valuable for future and more coarse-grained simulations of reactive hypersonic gas flow.</description>

      <title>Reaction Dynamics for the [NNO] System from State-Resolved and Coarse-Grained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics for the NO($X^2 \Pi$) + N($^4$S) $\leftrightarrow$ N$_{2}(X^{1}\Sigma_{g}^{+}$) + O($^{3}$P) reaction was followed in the $^3$A' electronic state using state-to-state (STS) and Arrhenius-based rates from two different high-level potential energy surfaces represented as a reproducing kernel (RKHS) and permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs). Despite the different number of bound states supported by the RKHS- and PIP-PESs the ignition points from STS and Arrhenius rates are at $\sim 10^{-6}$ s whether or not reverse rates are from assuming microreversibility or explicitly given. Conversion from NO to N$_2$ is incomplete if Arrhenius-rates are used but complete turnover is observed if STS-information is used. This is due to non-equilibrium energy flow and state dynamics which requires a state-based description. Including full dissociation leads asymptotically to the correct 2:1 [N]:[O] concentration with little differences for the species' dynamics depending on the PES used for the STS-information. In conclusion, concentration profiles from coarse-grained simulations are consistent over 14 orders of magnitude in time using STS-information based on two different high-level PESs.</description>

      <title>Modified Marrone-Treanor dissociation model: formulation and verification for diatom/atom mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified Marrone-Treanor (MMT) model for dissociation with rate parameters derived exclusively from quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). Analysis of the QCT dataset for reactant O2 and N2 diatoms sampled from Boltzmann internal energy distributions over a wide (T,Tv)-range indicates that a modified version of the classical Marrone-Treanor two-temperature model captures the most relevant physics of shock-heated dissociating diatomic species very well. We find that simple correction factors account for non-Boltzmann depletion effects observed in direct molecular simulations (DMS) employing the same PESs. The concentration-dependent functional form proposed for these correction factors ensures that depletion effects vanish at chemical equilibrium. Based on comparisons in isothermal and adiabatic heat baths we verify that the resulting MMT model accurately reproduces all major features observed in DMS, while remaining computationally inexpensive enough for large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.</description>

      <title>Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acid solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydride induced embrittlement (HIE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HIE effect, we propose an "HIE-mediated synthesis" approach, where bulk metal foils serve as precursors and oleic/sulfuric acid act as hydrogen donors under solvo/hydrothermal conditions, enabling the synthesis of 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH$_2$, ScH$_2$, YH$_2$, LaH$_2$, LaH$_{2.3}$, SmH$_2$, LuH$_2$, TiH$_2$, $\delta$-ZrH$_{1.6}$, $\epsilon$-ZrH$_2$, HfH$_{1.7}$, HfH$_2$, VH$_{0.8}$, VH$_2$, NbH, NbH$_2$, Ta$_2$H, and TaH). Integrated high-pressure experiments and first-principles calculations, the concept of equivalent chemical pressure ($\Delta$Pc) was introduced to elucidate the mechanism of synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides in an acidic environment. This mechanism predicts the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH. Our approach successfully converts HIE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>BO-graphane and BO-diamane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adsorption of boron and oxygen atoms onto mono- and multi-layer graphene leads to the formation of a buckled graphene layer (BO-graphane) and a 2D diamond-like structure (BO-diamane) sandwiched between boron monoxide layers per DFT calculations. BO-graphane has a calculated Young's modulus ($\it{E}$) of 750 GPA and BO-diamane 771 GPa, higher than the calculated $\it{E}$ of -F,-OH, and -H diamanes; this is due to the presence of B-O bonds in the functionalizing layers. Electronic band structure calculations show BO-graphane and BO-diamane are wide band gap semiconductors with an indirect band gap up to a thickness of three layers (3L). Phonon dispersion and $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm dynamic and thermal stability, maintaining structural integrity at 1000 K. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of BO-graphane and BO-diamane is found to be 879 W/m.K and 1260 W/m.K, respectively, surpassing BeO (385 W/m.K), MgO (64 W/m.K), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (36 W/m.K); and F-diamane (377 W/m.K), and comparable to H-diamane (1145-1960 W/m.K), suggesting them as candidates for thermal management in applications.</description>

      <title>pH-Dependent Zeta Potential Induces Diffusiophoretic Focusing in an Acid-Base Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusiophoresis of charged particles in the presence of electrolytes has been extensively studied in the literature. However, in these setups, particles typically move in a single direction, either up or down the electrolyte gradient. Here, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which a particle can reverse its diffusiophoretic direction within the same setup, leading to the formation of a focusing band under steady-state concentration gradients. Using multi-ion diffusiophoresis calculations, we simulate particle transport in an acid-based reaction system where salt is added alongside the acid. For a range of salt concentrations, particles focus within the channel. Our analysis reveals that a pH-dependent zeta potential is necessary for this focusing to occur, and determines where the particles focus, i.e., on or off the acid-base reaction front. We report qualitative agreement with prior experimental observations and derive analytical conditions governing particle focusing, highlighting the delicate balance between concentration gradients and zeta potential variations. The work elucidates the crucial physics of pH-dependent zeta potential and opens new avenues for exploring diffusiophoresis in acid-base systems, with implications for microfluidic design and biophysical transport processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>

Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of a QAOA sequence to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of our QAOA sequence over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark our QAOA sequence against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe superior performance, especially under noisy conditions. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the applicability of our QAOA sequence beyond two-qubit registers, specifically for polychromatic excitation of delocalized LLS in a six-proton system.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Advancements of the FHI-aims Software Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.</description>
