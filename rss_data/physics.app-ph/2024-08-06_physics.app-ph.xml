      <title>Electrical excitation of color centers in phosphorus-doped diamond Schottky diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust quantum light source operating upon electrical injection at ambient conditions is desirable for practical implementation of quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution or metrology. Color centers in diamond are promising candidates as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated temperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been demonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex diamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we demonstrate the emission of color centers under electrical pumping in a novel Schottky diode configuration based on hydrogen passivated n-type diamond, which holds promise for integrated single-photon emitting devices based on color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Revelation of the Best Performing Single Hetero-junction Thermophotovoltaic Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed to explore the highest performing single-heteronunction thermophotovoltaic cell. Initially, traditional homo junction TPV cells have been explored using ML methodologies for the optimal material combinations. ML methods have notably been devoted to analyze the importance of each parameter in the model, thereby improving the comprehension of the system's behavior and facilitating design optimization. Following this investigation, it has been found that Ge emerged as the most effective emitter layer when paired with the optimal base layer, InGaAsSb compound that possesses a direct bandgap of 0.53 eV. Subsequently, a p-Ge/n-InGaAsSb single-heterojunction TPV cell is introduced executing a device transport model featuring a p-n structure. This cell operated at black body (TBB) and cell temperatures of 1578 K and 300 K, respectively. Through meticulous optimization efforts, the performance of the TPV cell is significantly enhanced resulting in an impressive efficiency of 16.50%. This efficiency is accompanied by a short circuit current, JSC=15.53 A/cm2, an open-circuit voltage, VOC=0.47 V, and a fill factor FF=79.5%. These findings suggest that this structural configuration holds considerable promise for the development of high-performance TPV cells.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Oxide-Ion Synaptic Transistor for Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware facilitates rapid and energy-efficient training and operation of neural network models for artificial intelligence. However, existing analog in-memory computing devices, like memristors, continue to face significant challenges that impede their commercialization. These challenges include high variability due to their stochastic nature. Microfabricated electrochemical synapses offer a promising approach by functioning as an analog programmable resistor based on deterministic ion-insertion mechanisms. Here, we developed an all-solid-state oxide-ion synaptic transistor employing $\text{Bi}_2\text{V}_{0.9}\text{Cu}_{0.1}\text{O}_{5.35}$ as a superior oxide-ion conductor electrolyte and $\text{La}_\text{0.5}\text{Sr}_\text{0.5}\text{F}\text{O}_\text{3-$\delta$}$ as a variable resistance channel able to efficiently operate at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics. Our transistor exhibits essential synaptic behaviors such as long- and short-term potentiation, paired-pulse facilitation, and post-tetanic potentiation, mimicking fundamental properties of biological neural networks. Key criteria for efficient neuromorphic computing are satisfied, including excellent linear and symmetric synaptic plasticity, low energy consumption per programming pulse, and high endurance with minimal cycle-to-cycle variation. Integrated into an artificial neural network (ANN) simulation for handwritten digit recognition, the presented synaptic transistor achieved a 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, illustrating the effective implementation of our device in ANNs. These findings demonstrate the potential of oxide-ion based synaptic transistors for effective implementation in analog neuromorphic computing based on iontronics.</description>

      <title>YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ Josephson diode operating as a high-efficiency ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a focused He$^+$ beam for nanopatterning and writing of Josephson barriers we fabricated specially shaped Josephson junctions of in-line geometry in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ thin film microbridges with an asymmetry ratio of critical currents of opposite polarities (non-reciprocity ratio) $\approx 7$ at optimum magnetic field. Those Josephson diodes were subsequently used as ratchets to rectify an applied ac current into a dc voltage. We also demonstrate the operation of such a ratchet in the loaded regime, where it produces a nonzero dc output power and yields a thermodynamic efficiency of up to $75\,\mathrm{\%}$. The ratchet shows record figures of merit: an output dc voltage of up to $212\,\mathrm{\mu V}$ and an output power of up to $0.2\,\mathrm{nW}$. The device has an essential area $\approx 1\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$. For rectification of quasistatic Gaussian noise, the figures of merit are more modest, however the efficiency can be as high as for the deterministic ac drives within some regimes. Since the device is based on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, it can operate at temperatures up to $\sim40\,\mathrm{K}$, where more noise is available for rectification.</description>

      <title>Magnetodynamics of few-nanoparticle chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. Cryo-EM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from cryo-EM and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning $10^{9}$ in time and how switching develops from individual particles to entire chains. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast tunable photonic integrated Pockels extended-DBR laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-agile lasers that can simultaneously feature low noise characteristics as well as fast mode hop-free frequency tuning are keystone components for applications ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR, to coherent optical communication and gas sensing. The hybrid integration of III-V gain media with low-loss photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has recently enabled integrated lasers with faster tuning and lower phase noise than the best legacy systems, including fiber lasers. In addition, lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) PICs have enabled to exploit the Pockels effect to demonstrate self-injection locked hybrid lasers with tuning rates reaching peta-hertz per second. However, Pockels-tunable laser archetypes relying on high-Q optical microresonators have thus far only achieved limited output powers, are difficult to operate and stabilize due to the dynamics of self-injection locking, and require many analog control parameters. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging an extended distributed Bragg reflector (E-DBR) architecture to demonstrate a simple and turn-key operable frequency-agile Pockels laser that can be controlled with single analog operation and modulation inputs. Our laser supports a continuous mode hop-free tuning range of over 10 GHz with good linearity and flat actuation bandwidth up to 10 MHz, while achieving over 15 mW in-fiber output power at 1545 nm and kHz-level intrinsic linewidth, a combination unmet by legacy bulk lasers. This hybrid laser design combines an inexpensive reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) with an electro-optic DBR PIC manufactured at wafer-scale on a LNOI platform. We showcase the performance and flexibility of this laser in proof-of-concept coherent optical ranging (FMCW LiDAR) demonstration, achieving a 4 cm distance resolution and in a hydrogen cyanide spectroscopy experiment.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques. In the chemical etching technique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% of hydrofluoric acid solutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters of MNFs range is 0.34 {\mu}m - 1.4 {\mu}m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 {\mu}m - 0.53 {\mu}m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Nano-Particles with Customized Properties using Self-Assembly of Block-Copolymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significant attention as a promising application in various fields, including sensor, smart coating, drug delivery, and more. Here, we propose a novel mechanism assisted by machine-learning workflow to accurately predict phase diagram of NPs, which elegantly achieves tunability of shapes and internal structures of NPs using self-assembly of block-copolymers (BCP). Unlike most of previous studies, we obtain onion-like and mesoporous NPs in neutral environment and hamburger-like NPs in selective environment. Such novel phenomenon is obtained only by tailoring the topology of a miktoarm star BCP chain architecture without the need for any further treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the BCP chain architecture can be used as a new strategy for tuning the lamellar asymmetry of NPs. We show that the asymmetry between A and B lamellae in striped ellipsoidal and onion-like particles increases as the volume fraction of the A-block increases, beyond the level reached by linear BCPs. In addition, we find an extended region of onion-like structure in the phase diagram of A-selective environment, as well as the emergence of an inverse onion-like structure in the B-selective one. Our findings provide a valuable insight into the design and fabrication of nanoscale materials with customized properties, opening up new possibilities for advanced applications in sensing, materials science, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Scientific Exploration with Expert Knowledge (SEEK) in Autonomous Scanning Probe Microscopy with Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Microscopy techniques have played vital roles in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology, offering high-resolution imaging and detailed insights into properties at nanoscale and atomic level. The automation of microscopy experiments, in combination with machine learning approaches, is a transformative advancement, offering increased efficiency, reproducibility, and the capability to perform complex experiments. Our previous work on autonomous experimentation with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) demonstrated an active learning framework using deep kernel learning (DKL) for structure-property relationship discovery. This approach has demonstrated broad applications in various microscopy techniques. Here, to address limitations of workflows based on DKL, we developed methods to incorporate prior knowledge and human interest into DKL-based workflows and implemented these workflows in SPM. By integrating expected rewards from structure libraries or spectroscopic features, we enhanced the exploration efficiency of autonomous microscopy, demonstrating more efficient and targeted exploration in autonomous microscopy. We demonstrated the application of these methods in SPM, but we suggest that these methods can be seamlessly applied to other microscopy and imaging techniques. Furthermore, the concept can be adapted for general Bayesian optimization in material discovery across a broad range of autonomous experimental fields.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive imaging assisted CFD simulation of 4D multi-modal fluid flow using In-situ adaptor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to recover the true surfaces of fluid channels and fed to simulation tool (ANSYS) to create accurate cyber environment. The simulation tool also receives CT-assisted multiphase fluid profiles (belonging to the instance just before the flow starts) as an initial condition.
  This unique methodology is made possible by using a novel in-situ compact adaptor design is used to create fluid channels that can be placed inside any industrial X-ray CT and fulfill the above objective. It is integrated with an android based App to control the flow once placed inside CT. It is portable and compact enough: (a) to be placed inside various experimental environments, and (b) modular enough to be mounted with multi-modal systems simultaneously.
  Two key parameters, (a) spatial distribution and (b) the air volume fraction, are measured using two different non-invasive imaging modalities: (a) Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and (d) X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Simulated outcomes are correlated with the experimental outcomes from both EIT and X-ray CT, showing an agreement of 85 to 98 percent, respectively. Time-averaged electrically conductive fluid flow profile obtained by EIT shows a match with mass mass-attenuated fluid profile obtained by X-ray CT, justifying the utility of an in-situ adaptor. CT assistance for CFD studies can be replaced by EIT assistance as former techniques: (a) scanning time may be relatively slower than the latter, (b) it does not require rotations, (c) economical, and (d) fluid channels need not be placed inside of shielded compartment thus improving practicality. The data of analysis is shared in this work.
  Multimodal non-invasive imaging provides multiphase flow information, it also differentiates conductive, and mass-attenuated multiphase profiles at common cross-sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets are crucial for ultra-compact spintronics. However, so far, no vdW crystal has exhibited tunable above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in the 2D ultrathin regime. Here, we report the tunable above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin vdW crystal Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ ($x$ = 0 and 0.3). By increasing the Fe content, the Curie temperature (TC) and room-temperature saturation magnetization of bulk Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ crystals are enhanced from 354 to 376 K and 43.9 to 50.4 emu/g, respectively. Remarkably, the robust anomalous Hall effect in 3-nm Fe$_{3.3}$GaTe$_2$ indicate a record-high TC of 340 K and a large room-temperature perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy of 6.6 * 10^5 J/m$^3$, superior to other ultrathin vdW ferromagnets. First-principles calculations reveal the asymmetric density of states and an additional large spin exchange interaction in ultrathin Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ responsible for robust intrinsic ferromagnetism and higher Tc. This work opens a window for above-room-temperature ultrathin 2D magnets in vdW-integrated spintronics.</description>

      <title>Simple and effective mechanical cloaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that essentially perfect elastostatic mechanical cloaking of a circular inclusion in a homogeneous surrounding medium can be achieved by means of a simple cloak comprising three concentric annuli, each formed of a homogeneous isotropic linear elastic material of prescribed shear modulus. Importantly, we find that the same combination of annuli will cloak any possible mode of imposed deformation or loading, for any randomly chosen admixture of imposed compression, pure shear and simple shear, without the need to re-design the cloak for different deformation modes. A full range of circular inclusions can be cloaked in this way, from soft to stiff. In consequence, we suggest that an inclusion of any arbitrary shape can also be cloaked, by first enveloping it in a stiff circle, then cloaking the combined structure with three annuli as described. Given that a single inclusion can be fully cloaked in this way, even at near field close to the cloaking perimeter, it also follows that multiple such neutral inclusions arranged with arbitrarily high packing fraction in a surrounding medium can also be cloaked. We confirm this by direct simulation. This indicates a possible route to fabricating composite materials with the same global mechanical response as a counterpart homogeneous material, and with uniform strain and stress fields outwith the cloaked inclusions.</description>

      <title>Reemergence of Trampolining in a Leidenfrost Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The levitating Leidenfrost (LF) state of a droplet on a heated substrate is often accompanied by fascinating behaviors such as star-shaped deformations, self-propulsion, bouncing, and trampolining. These behaviors arise due to the vapor flow instabilities at the liquid-vapor interface beneath the droplet at sizes typically comparable to the capillary length scale of the liquid. Here, we report on the spontaneous bouncing, trampolining, and hovering behavior of an unconstrained LF water droplet. We observe that the water droplet exhibits an increase in bouncing height at specific radii with intermittent reduction in the height of bounce leading to a quiescent LF state. The reemergence of the trampolining behavior from the quiescent hovering state without any external forcing is observed at sizes as low as 0.1 times the capillary length. We attribute the droplet bouncing behavior to the dynamics of vapor flow beneath the LF droplet. We propose that the trampolining behavior of the droplet at specific radii is triggered by harmonic and subharmonic resonance between the natural frequency of the vapor layer and Rayleigh frequency of the droplet. This proposed mechanism of resonance-driven trampolining of LF droplets is observed to be applicable for different liquids irrespective of the initial volume and substrate temperatures, thus indicating a universality of the behavior. We attribute the intermittent trampolining events to the change in the natural frequency of the droplet and the vapor layer due to evaporative mass loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the design and simulation of strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces aimed at improving resonant coupling and photon routing efficiency. In our design, the guided mode is confined within a plane by a high-index thin film and is loosely confined laterally by a lower index strip. Using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) strip, titanium dioxide core, and silicon dioxide substrate, we optimise the waveguide dimensions for maximum lateral confinement of light. Specifically, we propose a polymer-based Bragg grating cavity and ring resonator that achieve near-optimal mode volumes and high Q-factors. Our simulations suggest that a cavity with a mode volume of V_{\text{eff}} \approx 7.0 \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^3 and a Q-factor of 7000 can produce photons with 97% indistinguishability at 4K. Additionally, we investigate directional couplers for efficient photon routing, comparing photonic and plasmonic material structures. While pure photonic structures demonstrate lower loss and improved quality factors, they face practical limitations in terms of bending radius. Conversely, plasmonic structures offer shorter bending radii but higher propagation losses. This research lays the groundwork for future nanophotonic designs, aiming to enhance photon generation and routing capabilities for quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards atom counting from first moment STEM images: methodology and possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a simulation-based study we develop a statistical model-based quantification method for atomic resolution first moment scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. This method uses the uniformly weighted least squares estimator to determine the unknown structure parameters of the images and to isolate contributions from individual atomic columns. In this way, a quantification of the projected potential per atomic column is achieved. Since the integrated projected potential of an atomic column scales linearly with the number of atoms it contains, it can serve as a basis for atom counting. The performance of atom counting from first moment STEM imaging is compared to that from traditional HAADF STEM in the presence of noise. Through this comparison, we demonstrate the advantage of first moment STEM images to attain more precise atom counts. Finally, we compare the integrated intensities extracted from first-moment images of a wedge-shaped sample to those values from the bulk crystal. The excellent agreement found between these values proves the robustness of using bulk crystal simulations as a reference library. This enables atom counting for samples with different shapes by comparison with these library values.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Optically Determined Solar Cell Current Transport Efficiency Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently suggested reciprocity relation states that the current transport efficiency from the junction to the cell terminal can be determined by differentiating luminescence images with respect to the terminal voltage. The validity of this relation is shown experimentally in this paper, by comparison with simultaneously measured electrical currents and simulations. Moreover, we verify that the method is applicable under various light concentrations and applied voltages, which allows us to investigate the cell in relevant conditions. Results evidence several kind of series resistances affecting the current transport efficiencies. We show that the relative contribution of those different resistances to the loss in current collection is a function of the illumination intensity.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Engineering of Wurtzite Ferroelectrics: Unveiling Phase Transition and Ferroelectric Switching in ScAlN Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of extreme device miniaturization and the exploration of novel physical phenomena have spurred significant interest in crystallographic phase control and ferroelectric switching in reduced dimensions. Recently, wurtzite ferroelectrics have emerged as a new class of functional materials, offering intriguing piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, CMOS compatibility, and seamless integration with mainstream semiconductor technology. However, the exploration of crystallographic phase and ferroelectric switching in reduced dimensions, especially in nanostructures, has remained a largely uncharted territory. In this study, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the crystallographic phase transition of ScAlN nanowires across the full Sc compositional range. While a gradual transition from wurtzite to cubic phase was observed with increasing Sc composition, we further demonstrated that a highly ordered wurtzite phase ScAlN could be confined at the ScAlN/GaN interface for Sc contents surpassing what is possible in conventional films, holding great potential to addressing the fundamental high coercive field of wurtzite ferroelectrics. In addition, we provide the first evidence of ferroelectric switching in ScAlN nanowires, a result that holds significant implications for future device miniaturization. Our demonstration of tunable ferroelectric ScAlN nanowires opens new possibilities for nanoscale, domain, alloy, strain, and quantum engineering of wurtzite ferroelectrics, representing a significant stride towards the development of next-generation, miniaturized devices based on wurtzite ferroelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, high composition (&gt;35%) thick (&gt;30 nm) barrier AlGaN/AlN/GaN HEMT structure grown on a sapphire substrate with ultra-low sheet resistivity (&lt;250 \Omega / \Box ) is reported. Optimization of growth conditions, such as reduced growth rate, low carbon incorporation, and thickness optimization of different epitaxial layers allowed to grow a crack-free high composition and thick AlGaN barrier layer HEMT structure. A significantly high two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density of 1.46 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2} with a room temperature mobility of 1710 cm^{2}/V.s is obtained by Hall measurement using the Van-Der-Pauw method. These state-of-the-art results show great potential for high-power Ga-polar HEMT design on the sapphire substrate.</description>

Abstract: In this work, elastic fractal higher-order topological states are investigated. Bott index is adopted to characterize the topological property of elastic fractal structures. The topological corner and edge states of elastic waves in fractal structures are realized theoretically and experimentally. Different from traditional two-dimension (2D) high-order topological insulators based on periodic structures, the high-order topological states based on elastic fractal structures in this work support not only abundant topological inner corner states and edge states, but also topological outer corner states. The richness of corner states is much higher than that of topological insulators based on periodic structures. The strong robustness of the topological corner states in the fractal structure are verified by introducing disorders and defects. The topological phenomenon of elastic fractal structures revealed in this work enriches the topological physics of elastic systems and breaks the limitation of that relies on periodic elastic structures. The results have important application prospects in energy harvesting, information transmissions, elastic energy acquisitions and high-sensitivity detections.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states associated with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Si-doped Al-rich thin regrown Al(Ga)N films on AlN on sapphire templates with $\gt10^{15}/cm^3$ free carrier concentration using close-coupled showerhead MOCVD reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin Si-doped Al-rich (Al&gt;0.85) regrown Al(Ga)N layers were deposited on AlN on Sapphire template using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The optimization of the deposition conditions such as temperature, V/III ratio, deposition rate, and Si concentration resulted in a high charge carrier concentration (&gt;$10^{15}/cm^{3}$) in the Si-doped Al-rich Al(Ga)N films. A pulsed deposition condition was employed to achieve a controllable Al composition greater than 95% and to prevent unintended Ga incorporation in the AlGaN material deposited using the close-coupled showerhead reactor. Also, the effect of unintentional Si incorporation on free charge carrier concentration at the regrowth interface was observed by varying the thickness of the regrown Al(Ga)N layer. A maximum charge carrier concentration of $4.8\times 10^{16}/cm^3$ and $7.5\times 10^{15}/cm^3$ were achieved for Al0.97Ga0.03N and AlN films with thickness &lt;300 nm compared to previously reported n-Al(Ga)N films with thickness $\ge$400 nm deposited using MOCVD technique.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric actuation for integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent decades have seen significant advancements in integrated photonics, driven by improvements in nanofabrication technology. This field has developed from integrated semiconductor lasers and low-loss waveguides to optical modulators, enabling the creation of sophisticated optical systems on a chip scale capable of performing complex functions like optical sensing, signal processing, and metrology. The tight confinement of optical modes in photonic waveguides further enhances the optical nonlinearity, leading to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena such as optical frequency combs, second-harmonic generation, and supercontinuum generation. Active tuning of photonic circuits is crucial not only for offsetting variations caused by fabrication in large-scale integration, but also serves as a fundamental component in programmable photonic circuits. Piezoelectric actuation in photonic devices offers a low-power, high-speed solution and is essential in the design of future photonic circuits due to its compatibility with materials like Si and Si3N4, which do not exhibit electro-optic effects. Here, we provide a detailed review of the latest developments in piezoelectric tuning and modulation, by examining various piezoelectric materials, actuator designs tailored to specific applications, and the capabilities and limitations of current technologies. Additionally, we explore the extensive applications enabled by piezoelectric actuators, including tunable lasers, frequency combs, quantum transducers, and optical isolators. These innovative ways of managing photon propagation and frequency on-chip are expected to be highly sought after in the future advancements of advanced photonic chips for both classical and quantum optical information processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electroluminescence device for on-demand single photon generation at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research focused on single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by layered semiconductors, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has revealed a promising alternative to quantum dots (QDs) for generating single, indistinguishable photons. hBN-based SPEs offer lower material costs, room temperature emission, and easy integration into potential optoelectronic devices due to the layered structure of the host crystal. This work presents compact hybrid electroluminescence devices, in which GaN laser diodes (LDs) are used for bottom-to-top excitation of hBN nanoflakes deposited on the laser facets. Our approach circumvents the issue of electroluminescence generation from hBN and provides access to the SPE's signal without optical driving by an external laser. Using laser diodes upgraded with Bragg reflectors a room-temperature generation of single photons from hBN is confirmed by an 80%-dip in their g(2) second-order correlation. The on-demand emission of single photons at room temperature is demonstrated by driving the laser diodes in pulsed operation, with confidence supported by a measured g(2)(0) value of 0.37.</description>
