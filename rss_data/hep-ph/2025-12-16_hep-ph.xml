      <title>Dynamical study of hidden-strange pentaquarks as analogs of the hidden-charm states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent BESIII experiment~\cite{BESIII:2024muk} searching for hidden-strange exotic hadrons, we perform a systematic theoretical study of the hidden-strange pentaquark system within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model (QDCSM) and the resonating group method (RGM). Our results demonstrate that the channel coupling effect plays a decisive role in the formation of bound and resonance states. It not only significantly enhances the short-range attraction but also induces essential attractive contributions from pion exchange. We predict three bound states with masses of $1759$ MeV, $2000$ MeV, and $2407$ MeV. Furthermore, we report the existence of a hidden-strange pentaquark resonance state, $\Xi K^{\ast}$, with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1/2^{-})$. This resonance is identified in the $S$-wave scattering phase shifts of the $\Lambda\eta_{s}$ and $\Lambda \phi$ open channels, with a predicted mass in the range of $2204\text{--}2208$ MeV. By accounting for both the scattering width from channel coupling and the intrinsic decay width of the constituent $K^{\ast}$, the total decay width is estimated to be $55\text{--}63$ MeV. These theoretical predictions provide important guidance for future experimental searches for such exotic states at facilities like BESIII.</description>

      <title>From DGLAP to Sudakov: Precision Predictions for Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations in the distribution of energy produced in collider experiments provide a snapshot of the microscopic dynamics of QCD, and its evolution from asymptotically free quarks and gluons, to confined hadrons. There has recently been considerable progress in the interpretation and precision calculation of these correlations, using a specific class of observables called energy correlators (EECs). These observables are most cleanly studied in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where they can be measured over their full angular range. Of particular interest are kinematic limits of the correlator, both collinear, and back-to-back, where the correlator exhibits scaling behaviors governed by specific operators in QCD. Resolving these scalings requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, which can be achieved by performing measurements on tracks (charged particles). In this paper we perform the first calculation of the track-based EEC over its entire kinematic range, achieving a record precision of of NNLL (collinear) + NNLO (fixed order) + NNNNLL (back-to-back) for the track-based EEC, and additionally incorporate the leading non-perturbative corrections and their resummation, including the Collins-Soper kernel computed using lattice QCD. We describe the breadth of physics probed by this observable, and highlight the impact of different components of our factorization theorem on the final distribution. Combined with recent measurements of the track-based EEC with archival LEP data, our calculation initiates the precision study of track-based observables at LEP, which will lead to new insights into the dynamics of QCD, and the precision extraction of its underlying parameters.</description>

      <title>Directional dead-cone effect in QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of heavy quarks through a dense, hydrodynamically flowing QCD medium, representative of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Working in the high-energy limit, we identify two novel mass-dependent effects arising from the heavy quark coupling to the local medium flow. The first is the emergence of a tensorial jet transport coefficient, $\hat{q}_{ij}$, which encodes the directional structure of transverse-momentum broadening. The second, named the directional dead-cone effect, corresponds to an anisotropic suppression of medium-induced radiation aligned with the hydrodynamic flow. We discuss how these effects manifest in jet observables and identify distinctive signature of heavy quark dynamics in an evolving medium.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Evolution for In-medium Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analysis of the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC) in light-quark and gluon jets propagating through nuclear matter. Our work focuses on the analytic structure of the RG equations in the thin-medium regime, highlighting how collinear emissions in the presence of a dense QCD medium reshape the EEC observables. We work in the opacity expansion of the SCET$_{\rm G}$ formalism, where the propagating quarks and gluons interact with the medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. We compute the corresponding one-loop jet functions using the medium-induced splitting kernels at first order in opacity and perform resummation at leading logarithmic (LL) order. In particular, we identify an experimentally accessible regime of jet energies and EEC angles where one can directly investigate the medium-induced scale evolution and extract the corresponding opacity-one correction to the anomalous dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically, using the method of regions, the Coulomb-logarithmic enhancement regulated by plasma screening for EEC. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data in $p$-Pb collisions and make projections for O-O collisions to test whether energy correlators could serve as sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics in small collision systems, offering a robust and model-independent avenue for constraining jet evolution in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Axion Portal in the LUXE-NPOD Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical dump at the LUXE experiment has the potential to create a large flux of $\mathcal{O}({\rm GeV})$ photons that can be used to look for new physics when directed at a solid material dump. The LUXE-NPOD extension of LUXE, which focuses the hard photons onto a slab of tungsten, offers two interaction points (laser-electron and photon-tungsten), making it well-suited to test theories containing two or more new particles. We examine the dark axion portal, a scenario involving both dark photons (DPs) and axion-like particles (ALPs) and their mutual interactions, and its implications on the phenomenology at LUXE-NPOD. To simulate the spectra of particle populations generated at the electron-laser interaction point, we solve a set of extended 1D cascade equations. We recover a photon spectrum consistent with previous analyses and present previously unconsidered DP and ALP spectra. We derive the overall sensitivity of LUXE-NPOD to various parameters of the new particles, and show that it is capable of probing previously uncharted regions in the dark axion parameter space. For ALPs in the $10$-$500$ MeV mass range and DPs either heavier ($\sim{\rm GeV}$) or significantly lighter $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18}$-$10^{-13})$ eV, we obtain novel constraints on DP kinetic mixing parameters smaller than $10^{-2}$ and on $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}$-$10^{-3})$ GeV$^{-1}$ ALP-photon couplings. We find that restrictions on $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$ kinetic mixing can be extracted for arbitrarily small DP masses. Our discussion aims to be systematic and demonstrates a practical method of analyzing constraints on multi-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Melting LHC detectors: a novel search for stopped long-lived particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles at the TeV scale with lifetimes of a year or longer could have been abundantly produced at the LHC yet escaped detection because of backgrounds, and could still be trapped within detector materials. With gluinos in split-supersymmetry as a working example, we show that these trapped particles can be recovered from detector materials once prepared in liquid form, for example, by melting silicon detectors, extracting liquid argon from the electromagnetic calorimeter, or constructing a large water pool near ATLAS or CMS. These liquid samples can then be processed using iterative centrifugation followed by mass spectrometry, enabling single-particle sensitivity in macroscopic samples. This method can potentially discover gluinos up to 3 TeV in mass at the HL-LHC. It can also improve upon existing limits for other long-lived particles. For example, it can discover the stop up to 2 TeV, and will also be sensitive to integer-charged particles in the TeV range.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scotogenic generation of the Linear and Inverse seesaws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an economical model in which the tiny active neutrino masses arise from an interplay of linear and inverse seesaw mechanisms. The Standard Model is extended by a local $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and discrete $\mathbb{Z}_{3}\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ symmetries, together with gauge-singlet scalars and neutral leptons. Owing to the preserved discrete symmetries after spontaneous symmetry breaking, the linear and inverse seesaw mechanisms are dynamically generated at the two-loop level, while the same symmetries ensure the stability of both scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. One of the distinctive features of the model is a fermionic dark matter candidate whose mass is generated at one loop, whereas scalar dark matter masses arise at tree level. The model satisfies current constraints from neutrino oscillation data, dark matter direct detection, invisible Higgs decays, $Z'$ searches, and charged lepton flavor violation, in addition we also discuss predictions for muonium states. The outcome of our analysis is that the inverse seesaw contribution dominates over the linear one, suggesting that atmospheric neutrino mass squared splitting arises from the inverse seesaw mechanism, whereas the solar one is generated from the linear seesaw. Finally, our model offers an explanation of the hierarchy between the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass squared splittings, in addition to the smallness of active neutrino masses, feature not presented in many low-scale seesaw models. In addition, our parameter-space scan shows a slight preference for the normal neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Implications of asymptotic safety in two minimal Z-prime models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the implications of asymptotic safety on two U(1) gauge extensions of the standard model that are minimal in the sense that anomaly cancellation only requires the presence of right-handed neutrinos. We study the UV fixed points of the gauge couplings taking into account kinetic mixing between hypercharge and the new U(1) gauge field. We consider the possibility that the top-bottom mass splitting originates from the effect of differing gauge charges on the nontrivial fixed point values of their respective Yukawa couplings and assess the impact of the extended gauge symmetry on the viability of this picture.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter with magnetic resonance force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) search for axion dark matter around 1 GHz. The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings.</description>

      <title>Azimuth Quadrupole Spectra derived from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb PID Differential $v_2(p_t)$ Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $v_2(p_t)$ data are intended to estimate the amplitude of an azimuth component of particle spectra interpreted as representing elliptic flow of a dense QCD medium. As defined, $ v_2(p_t)$ is a ratio with a single-particle spectrum appearing in its denominator. Its numerator represents a spectrum Fourier component arising from a boosted particle source. The Cooper-Frye (CF) formalism may be used to describe emission from a boosted source. CF analysis reveals that the $v_2(p_t)$ numerator includes a factor $ p_t$ in the boost frame with major consequences for data interpretation. A unique quadrupole $p_t$ spectrum may be isolated from $v_2(p_t)$ data and compared directly with the single-particle spectrum in the $v_2$ denominator and with hydro theory. A monopole boost (aka radial flow) value may be estimated from $v_2(p_t)$ data. Several novel results emerge via the Cooper-Frye analysis.</description>

      <title>Neutral and charged pion Form Factors in the intermediate-energy region from double-dilaton HQCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Form Factors of both neutral and charged pion using a non-perturbative running of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ obtained using a double-dilaton Holographic QCD model. These form factors remain poorly understood in the intermediate-energy region, which marks the transition between low- and high-energy physics. In particular, experimental data for the neutral pion Form Factor exhibits a deviation from the expected asymptotic behavior, and the charged pion form factor remains comparatively less explored. To address these issues, we employ the pion distribution amplitude formalism to investigate the Form Factor behavior in this intermediate regime. Our results suggests that non-perturbative physics of the strong interaction is relevant even at energy scales traditionally considered perturbative, implying that the perturbative regime could occur at higher energies than previously thought. Finally, our approach allows us to study isospin-breaking effects through the quadratic pion mass difference.</description>

      <title>New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.</description>

      <title>Probing the Core of Nuclear Structure through the $\pi N$ Scattering at an Electron-Positron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range correlation pairs (SRCs) -- core of nuclear structure, composed of highly off-shell nucleons -- are mostly studied via electron-nucleon scattering, leaving a gap in meson-based probes. We propose probing SRC off-shell nucleons via quasielastic $\pi^+$-bound proton scattering ($\pi^+ p \to \pi^+ p$) at electron-positron colliders, of which the beryllium-based ($^{9}$Be) beam pipe of the BESIII experiment operating at BEPCII, addresses a key gap and enables meson-beam investigations of SRCs. We point out that off-shellness of SRC nucleons yields measurable signatures: accumulated missing energy ($\sim0.1$\,GeV), shifted proton effective mass (0.7-0.8\,GeV), and cross-section differences from free scattering or with only Fermi motion. As an estimate, we find that BESIII's high luminosity and $\pi^+$ yield support $\sim10^4$ scattering events, while STCF ($50\times$ higher luminosity) will greatly enhance this number. This first meson-beam SRC study at an electron-positron collider fills $^{9}$Be research gaps and advances understanding of nuclear structure core and nonperturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of $J^{PC} = 0^{\pm\pm}$ Gluonic Hidden-Charm Tetraquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states composed of two valence quarks, two valence antiquarks and an explicit valence gluon. In the color configuration $[\bar{3}_c]_{c q}\otimes[8_c]_{G}\otimes[3_c]_{\bar{c}\bar{q}}$, a complete set of eight interpolating currents is constructed for states with quantum numbers $^{PC}=0^{++}$, $0^{-+},$ $0^{--}$, and $0^{+-}$. The corresponding mass spectra are systematically analysed within the QCD sum rule framework, including nonperturbative condensate contributions up to dimension eight. Our numerical analysis indicates the possible existence of six gluonic hidden-charm tetraquark states exhibiting stable behaviour in the adopted Borel windows. By replacing the charm quark with the bottom quark, masses for the corresponding hidden-bottom partners are also estimated. Possible production mechanisms and dominant decay channels are discussed, providing phenomenological guidance for experimental searches. These predicted states may be accessible at current and forthcoming facilities, including Belle II, PANDA, SuperB and LHCb, and thus offer an opportunity to probe explicit gluonic degrees of freedom in multiquark systems and deepen our understanding of nonperturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Gluon Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton Confronted with Lattice Data II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon gravitational form factors of the $\pi$, $N$, $\rho$, and $\Delta$ using lattice QCD data at $m_\pi \approx 450 \text{MeV}$ and $m_\pi \approx 170 \text{MeV}$. We base the analysis on fits to a simple $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, supplemented by a polynomial background term. The fitted residues agree with predictions from dilaton effective theory, in which the $\sigma$-meson acts as the dilaton, the pseudo Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. We derive new dilaton-based predictions for the $\rho$- and $\Delta$-gravitational form factors, and comment on the $\eta_{c}$- and $\eta_b$-form factors in the context of the dilaton interpretation. These results reinforce our earlier findings, based on lattice total (quark and gluon) gravitational form factors, and provide further evidence that QCD dynamics may be governed by an infrared fixed point.</description>

      <title>Interference Effects in Resonant Standard Model di-Higgs Production and Decay into $4b$ Final States: the Role of Machine Learning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final state with four $b$-quarks has generally the largest event rate in Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs ($h_{\rm SM}$) pair production, but also the largest backgrounds. We study such a final state using the $gg\to h_{\rm SM}h_{\rm SM}$ production mechanism and Benchmarks Points (BPs) derived from the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) in the boosted case, leading to two (fat) 'Higgs jets'. To suppress the backgrounds we use a combination of both kinematical cuts and jet substructure features exploiting Machine Learning (ML) analysis. We simulate the signal BPs both with and without the interference of the resonant $s$-channel diagram with the non-resonant topologies emerging from both the SM and NMSSM. The ML architecture of choice here is based on a multi-modal Transformer, which performs significantly better than traditional ML algorithms, in two respects: firstly, it enables to achieve higher significances and, secondly, it adapts better to the analysis dataset with interferences even if it was trained on one without these. However, neglecting the effect of the latter in experimental searches could lead to grossly mistaken results.</description>

      <title>The Entropic Skin Spatial Entanglement from the QCD Confinement Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations into High-Energy QCD have identified entanglement entropy as a crucial observable, linking parton distributions to the structure of the quantum vacuum. While momentum-space entanglement has been extensively studied in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the spatial realization of this entanglement in confined systems remains an open question. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Chasing higgsino dark matter at colliders in the neutrino fog era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgsinos can be the lightest supersymmetric particles, allowing for either a full or partial dark matter interpretation, with the correct thermal freeze-out abundance obtained for masses near 1.1 TeV. Dark matter direct detection experimental results, now rapidly approaching the neutrino fog, imposes increasingly stringent requirements on higgsino purity. We begin by summarizing the purity constraints implied by the current strong limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment in 2024, presenting them as lower bounds on gaugino masses in scenarios with decoupled sfermions and heavy Higgs bosons. We further quantify how these constraints will evolve as direct detection approaches various neutrino fog discovery and exclusion definitions and future exclusion projections. Finally, given that nearly pure higgsinos remain notoriously challenging to probe directly at colliders, we explore complementary signatures in which higgsinos are produced from the decays of heavier superpartners, where additional leptons and jets can be used for triggering. In particular, we advocate for searches of stop and wino pairs decaying directly to higgsinos as a promising means to probe higgsino dark matter well into the neutrino fog era.</description>

      <title>Space-time Geometry of Small and Large Collision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identified-hadron spectra from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb and $p$-$p$ collisions are analyzed via a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions. The object of study is evidence for jet suppression in small and large collision systems. Conventional methods include Pb-Pb centrality determination via classical Glauber model and evidence for high-$ p_t$ suppression sought via spectrum ratio $R_\text{AA}$. Previous $p$-Pb studies questioned the validity of the classical Glauber model. In the present study A-A geometry is determined instead via ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data. Based on certain features of Pb-Pb spectra the validity of the factorization assumption is also questioned. The entire jet contribution is therefore treated without factorization in ratio to a $p$-$p$ spectrum model as reference. These new results indicate that exclusivity (a nucleon may only interact with one nucleon ``at a time'') and time dilation (experienced by participant partons) play an essential role in jet production not incorporated in Glauber model or hard-component factorization. The combination determines an effective number of N-N collisions per participant nucleon given specific Pb-Pb centrality: multiple collisions if associated with low-$x$ (slow) partons, a single collision if associated with high-$x$ (fast) partons experiencing strong time dilation. The effect on parton fragment (jet) distributions on $p_t$ may be misinterpreted as jet suppression, but is similar to projectile-proton fragment distributions on pseudorapidity from fixed-target $p$-A experiments where low-$\eta$ densities scale with A while high-$\eta$ densities are consistent with $p$-$p$ collisions. $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra similarly analyzed reflect the same physics given different geometries. Actual jet suppression related to QGP formation is not evident.</description>

      <title>Signal Modelling with Overdetermined Morphing Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise modelling of a signal in processes with multiple observables, exhibiting a complex dependency on the underlying parameters, is often a difficult and challenging task. Predicting the results of experimental measurements in high-energy physics reactions serves a good example. The reaction rates and distributions of momenta of the final state particles, depend on the parameters of the underlying physics model in a non-trivial way. The conventional way to predict the experimental of observables is to use the Monte Carlo morphing technique on a finite discrete set of simulated samples. In this article we extend this technique by using the overdetermined morphing basis. We show that our approach yields a better result than the traditional technique in terms of the statistical power and uniformity of the resulting prediction, and delivers better precision. We further demonstrate that the overdetermined morphing is better suited for description of extended regions of phase space than the conventional morphing. We use the modelling of kinematic distributions of the final state particles produced in decays of non-Standard Model Higgs bosons as an example.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Bethe-Salpeter study of OZI-rule allowed strong decays: determination of total width of $h_{c}(2P)$ and $^{3}P_{0}$ model parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong decays allowed by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule play a decisive role in determining the properties of particles. The widely used $^{3}P_{0}$ model is non-relativistic and contains unknown adjustable parameter $\gamma$ that need to be determined experimentally. Based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we have derived a relativistic calculation formula without additional parameters similar to $\gamma$. Using this method, we present the total width of $h_{c}(2P)$ and theoretically determine the value of the parameter $\gamma$ in the $^{3}P_{0}$ model.</description>

      <title>The post-inflationary cosmology of the VISH$\nu$ axion-majoron model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was previously shown how several explanatory deficiencies of the Standard Model (including the origin of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, small active neutrino mass, strong CP-conservation and the seeds for large-scale structure formation) may be economically resolved when an experimentally-accessible QCD axion also plays the role of the majoron, and the scalar partner of the axion is dynamical during inflation. In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\nu$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\nu$ from alternative proposals.</description>

      <title>Peccei-Quinn Genesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cogenesis mechanism that unifies the origin of QCD axion dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the framework of Peccei-Quinn pole inflation. The model integrates the Peccei-Quinn symmetry with the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. This allows for spontaneous leptogenesis, which generates the required $B-L$ asymmetry around the seesaw scale. The necessary initial axion kinetic misalignment is naturally sourced by a PQ field driving pole inflation. Analysis within the KSVZ axion model demonstrates that achieving simultaneous correct DM abundance and baryon asymmetry limits the axion decay constant to be smaller than about $10^9$ GeV. This framework offers a unified solution to four fundamental problems: the strong CP problem, neutrino mass, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize chiral perturbation theory with spinless matter fields in the fundamental representation of ${\rm SU}(N)$ to curved spacetime in the presence of an external gravitational field. This work is motivated by recent interest in investigating energy-momentum tensor matrix elements of matter fields. The complete chiral Lagrangian is constructed, including both minimal extensions from flat spacetime and new curvature-induced terms, up to the next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion, $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We perform a systematic one-loop renormalization of the generating functional using the background field method combined with the heat-kernel technique, and explicitly compute the resulting ultraviolet divergences.</description>

      <title>Sign Reversal of Boer-Mulders Functions from Semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering to the Drell-Yan Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking prediction of QCD on the properties of the novel Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) distribution functions is that the time-reversal odd Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions extracted from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) will undergo a sign reversal in the Drell-Yan (DY) process. This prediction has been tested by experiments that have focused on the Sivers functions so far. We examine the current status on the theoretical prediction and experimental extraction of the signs of the Boer-Mulders functions from SIDIS and DY. We show that the existing SIDIS and DY data are consistent with the predicted sign reversal of the Boer-Mulders functions for proton's valence quark distribution. Prospects for future experiments at EIC capable of testing the sign reversal of the pion Boer-Mulders functions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Energy Loss of a Heavy Quark in a Collisional Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on the energy loss of a heavy fermion in a QED plasma to the Quark-Gluon plasma, using the same Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. The calculation is carried out with a theoretical method where the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator is used for arbitrary momentum transfer in the scattering processes. Encoding the collision effect in a self-consistent manner, the resummed gluon propagator regulates the infrared divergence in the scattering amplitude without introducing an artificial cutoff for the transferred momenta and makes the analysis on the hard and soft processes in a unified framework. To place our computation on a more solid foundation, we also explicitly demonstrate the gauge independence of the interaction rate as well as the elimination of unphysical gluon polarizations by the ghost field under the use of the resummed gluon propagator. In addition, with our complete QCD calculation by including both quark-quark and quark-gluon scatterings, we provide a quantitatively reliable result on the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark where the new contribution from quark-gluon scatterings accounts for a larger portion of the total energy loss. In general, collisions between the thermal partons result in an increased energy loss which becomes more pronounced with increasing gauge coupling. Considering a typical coupling constant in QCD, $\alpha_s = 0.3$, the energy loss increases $\sim 8$% at large incident velocities as compared to the collisionless limit. Such a collision-induced correction is still moderate although it is sightly suppressed as compared to our previous estimate based on a QED calculation using couplings consistent with those expected to be generated in the Quark-Gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, a number of experiments dedicated to searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) have been proposed, approved, or have entered operation. While the sensitivities of these experiments to various LLP scenarios have been extensively studied, key aspects--such as detector geometries, background estimates, and projected operational durations--for several facilities, including MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and SHiP, have undergone significant updates. In this work, we implement the latest experimental designs in the Displaced Decay Counter tool for calculating detector acceptances and signal-event yields, and re-evaluate their sensitivity reach to one of the most widely studied LLP scenarios, namely minimal heavy neutral leptons.</description>

      <title>Running coupling constant and jet quenching parameter in the spinning background from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the running coupling constant of heavy quark pair and jet quenching parameter in the spinning background. Ultra-locally, the boosted fluid is described by the boosted parameter and dual to a globally rotating system. Our results show that the angular momentum suppresses the running coupling constant and reduces its maximum value. The results demonstrate that the angular momentum promotes the dissociation of quarkonium and has a stronger effect on the running coupling constant when the axis of $Q\overline{Q}$ is transverse to the direction of the angular momentum. We also find that the angular momentum enhances the jet quenching parameter and has a stronger effect when the jet moves transversely to the direction of the angular momentum, namely $\hat{q}_{\perp}&gt; \hat{q}_{\parallel}$. We discuss the dependence of the jet quenching parameter on the $\eta/s$ at strong coupling in the presence of the angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The nonleptonic decays of double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the two-body nonleptonic decays of double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the nonfactorizable amplitudes contributed by $W$-exchange diagrams are evaluated under pole model assumption. To reduce sensitivity of decay amplitudes to arbitrary choice of baryon wave functions, we adopted charmed baryon wave functions obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic quark potential model. Our results show that the branching fractions of CF decays $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}\pi^{+}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$, as well as the SCS decays $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}K^{+}$, $\Sigma_{cc}^{++}K^{-}$, $\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\eta$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\bar{K}^{0}$ can reach up to a few percents. Particularly for the $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\to\Omega_{c}^{0}K^{+}$ mode, owing to the large factorizable amplitude and constructive pole contributions, the branching fraction is comparable to CF decays. These decay modes can serve as the discovery channels for the double-charmed baryon $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ in future experiments like LHCb and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Testable Inverse Seesaw Motivated from a High Quality QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion remains one of the most compelling solutions to the strong CP problem. Meanwhile, the type-I seesaw mechanism offers an elegant explanation for the lightness of the observed neutrino masses; however, its extremely heavy Majorana states place it far beyond experimental reach. Low-scale alternatives such as the inverse seesaw improve testability but typically lack a strong theoretical motivation. In this paper we bridge this gap by showing that gauging the discrete symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$-motivated by the internal structure of the Standard Model-naturally yields a QCD axion with a high-quality Peccei-Quinn symmetry solving the strong CP problem, while simultaneously enforcing the field content and hierarchy required for a natural inverse seesaw. The resulting model is highly predictive and has the potential to be fully tested by future experiments. Beyond addressing the strong CP problem and the origin of neutrino masses, our scenario also contains a viable dark-matter candidate and offers potential mechanisms for generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Probing the pion gluon distribution at small-$x$ in photon-induced interactions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose the analysis of the heavy quark photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in hadronic collisions at the LHC as an alternative to probe the pion gluon distribution in a kinematical range not covered by previous experiments. We perform an exploratory study of the charm and bottom photoproduction associated with a leading neutron in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-lead ($pPb$) collisions, and present calculations for the rapidity distributions and cross-sections. Our predictions indicate that experimental studies of these processes are feasible, and that a future measurement of this final state will be useful to constrain the pion gluon distribution at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable and to improve our understanding of the pion structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent developments in PYTHIA for the modelling of hadronic cascades in a medium. Several improvements have been made in the Angantyr model for collisions with nuclei, especially in the limit of low collision energies, allowing it to be used throughout the hadronic cascades. Also the simplified nuclear model in the PythiaCascade} module has been updated. We find that the two models give consistent results for cosmic ray air showers initiated by both high energy protons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression and elliptic flow in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma using the quantum trajectories method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bottomonium dynamics in a momentum-space anisotropic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) using the quantum trajectories (QTraj) framework. The real part of the heavy-quark potential is obtained from a minimal extension of the Karsch-Mehr-Satz (KMS) potential, while the angle-averaged imaginary part is derived to leading order in the anisotropy parameter $\xi$ and modeled to interpolate smoothly between the small- and large -$\xi$ regimes. The resulting anisotropic complex potential is used to solve the real-time Schr\"odinger equation using QTraj for the evolution of bottomonium in heavy-ion collisions. Nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$, double ratios, and elliptic flow coefficients $v_2$ for the $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, and $\Upsilon(3S)$ states are computed, including feed-down contributions, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02 \, \text{TeV}$. The QTraj-Aniso predictions successfully reproduce the observed sequential suppression pattern and non-zero elliptic flow, showing good agreement with experimental measurements from the ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS collaborations and demonstrating the relevance of path-length dependent suppression and medium anisotropy in quarkonium phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of critical regions for the renormalized quark-meson model with and without Polyakov loop potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical regions enveloping the critical end point (CEP) in the chemical potential-temperature plane of phase diagrams, have been mapped by drawing the contours of the normalized quark number susceptibility in the on-shell renormalized two plus one flavor quark meson model (RQM) and Polyakov loop enhanced renormalized Polyakov quark meson (RPQM) model when sigma meson mass=400 and 500 MeV. The renormalized t Hooft coupling c gets significantly stronger when the meson self energies due to quark loops are computed using the pole masses of mesons and parameters are fixed on shell in the Ref. [141] after consistent treatment of the quark one-loop vacuum fluctuation for the RQM model where the light and strange chiral symmetry breaking strengths also become weaker. The impact of the above novel features on the critical fluctuations have been computed. The improved PolyLog-glue form of the Polyakov loop potential of the Ref. [46], is employed to study the effect of the quark back reaction on critical fluctuations and results are compared with the scenario where quark back reaction is absent in the RPQM model with the Log form of the Polyakov loop potential. Using the large Nc standard chiral perturbation theory inputs,~the phase diagrams are computed in the light chiral limit of zero pion mass and the proximity of the tricritical point (TCP) with the CEP is quantified in the chemical potential-temperature plane.The RQM, RPQM model critical regions are compared with those reported in the Ref. [118] by different treatment of quark one-loop vacuum term where curvature masses of mesons are used to fix the parameters of the quark meson(QM), Polyakov quark meson (PQM) model.</description>

      <title>The heavy quark-antiquark asymmetry in the variable flavor number scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twist-2 heavy-quark and antiquark distributions, as defined in the variable flavor number scheme, turn out to be different due to QCD corrections from three-loop onward. This is caused by terms containing the color factor $d_{abc} d^{abc}$ in the heavy-flavor massive pure-singlet operator matrix elements (OMEs) $A^{\rm PS, s, (3)}_{Qq}$ for odd moments in the unpolarized case and for $\Delta A^{\rm PS, s, (3)}_{Qq}$ for even moments in the polarized case. The dependence on the factorization scale of the OMEs is ruled by the anomalous dimensions $\gamma^{\rm NS, s, (2)}_{qq}$ and $\Delta \gamma^{\rm NS, s, (2)}_{qq}$. The polarized calculations are performed in the Larin scheme. We compute the corresponding three-loop heavy-flavor distributions $(\Delta) f_Q(x,Q^2) - (\Delta) f_{\overline{Q}}(x,Q^2)$. Compared to the sum of the heavy-quark and antiquark parton distributions, their difference is small, however, non-vanishing.</description>

      <title>Exploring the freeze-in mechanism for scotogenic singlet dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploratory study of the freeze-in mechanism within a scotogenic framework, where dark matter can either be a scalar singlet or a fermion singlet. Based on a random parameter scan, we show that large portions of the parameter space feature a dark matter relic density in agreement with the limits derived by Planck. Moreover, constraints related to lepton flavour violation are mostly respected within such parameter regions. Our study shows that it will be worth to further investigate the freeze-in mechanism within scotogenic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Neutrino texture-zeros after JUNO's first results: Implications for long baseline neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent results from the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment have significantly improved our knowledge of the solar mixing angle $\theta_{12}$ and the solar mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{21}$. We study the impact of these improved estimates on the validity of texture-zeros in the light neutrino mass matrix by assuming neutrinos to be of Majorana nature. Considering a diagonal charged lepton basis, we revisit the previously allowed one-zero and two-zero textures and check their validity by using updated neutrino data from JUNO. While JUNO data rule out one previously allowed two-zero texture, they also make predictions for other neutrino parameters more precise. We finally study the prospects of probing the currently allowed texture-zeros and their predicted correlations among neutrino parameters at future long baseline neutrino experiments like the DUNE. The inclusion of JUNO and reactor experiments strengthens DUNE's ability to constrain the allowed parameter space of both one-zero and two-zero textures.</description>

      <title>The Potential of HEFT and the scale of New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a geometric framework to compute the leading high-energy behaviour of tree-level scattering amplitudes in theories containing $N$ Nambu-Goldstone bosons and a single Higgs-like scalar with an arbitrary potential $V$. Using these methods, we obtain closed-form expressions for the leading contribution to the full infinite set of tree amplitudes involving any number of Goldstone and Higgs-like external states. These results are then used to derive total cross sections, decay rates, and perturbative unitarity bounds. We then apply our general formalism to the Standard Model scalar sector using the equivalence theorem, working in the regime of small field-space curvature, and use it to characterise the relation between Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We analyse three representative classes of models. Two reproduce previously known behaviours, while the third, based on a dilaton effective theory, exhibits a noteworthy feature within the HEFT framework: a smooth decoupling limit that connects HEFT directly to the Standard Model without passing through a SMEFT regime, providing a possible backdoor to the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>One-flavon flavor: A single hierarchical parameter $B$ organizes quarks and leptons at $M_Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor hierarchies emerge from a single hierarchical parameter $B$ in a one-flavon Froggatt--Nielsen scheme. Fixing $B=5.357$ from charged-lepton ratios ($m_e:m_\mu:m_\tau\!\propto\!e^5:e^2:1$, $e=1/B$), we reproduce quark masses and CKM targets at $M_Z$ with $O(1)$ coefficients. The same $e$ gives viable lepton textures and benchmarks for $U_{\rm PMNS}$, $\sum m_\nu$, and $m_{\beta\beta}$. Compact correlations ($|V_{us}|,|V_{cb}|,|V_{ub}|,\theta_{13}^{\rm PMNS}$) follow from powers of $e$.</description>

      <title>A post-inflationary kinetic axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of axion kinetic misalignment, triggered by a Hubble-induced phase transition during a post-inflationary stiff (kination) era. A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $\Phi$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|\Phi|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of axions in a scaling string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings formed when the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks post-inflation are expected to emit axions throughout their lifetime. The details of the evolution of this network and the associated spectrum of axions are crucial for obtaining an accurate axion mass prediction, thus guiding searches at haloscopes. In a previous publication, we obtained evidence for the standard scaling of axion string networks, showing that the number of horizon lengths of string per horizon volume asymptotes to an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant. In this article, we turn our attention to the axion spectra, studying spectra of all components of the axion current and their unequal time correlators. With the new information we are better able to distinguish the contributions from propagating axions from the field carried by the strings, and show that previous measurements of the axion energy spectrum based only on the timelike component of the current are approximately 30\% derived from the string fields. We introduce a simple model based on an ensemble of string segments, which accounts for the general features of the spectra and time correlations. We conclude that axion emission from a scaling string network is close to scale-invariant ($q \approx 1$), and that the energy spectrum of sub-horizon modes behaves as $p_\text{ax}\ln( k \tau)$, where $k$ is the comoving wavenumber, $\tau$ the conformal time and $p_\text{ax} \simeq 10$. The number density spectrum evolves towards a single curve for $k\tau \lesssim 10^2$, with higher wavenumber deviations arising from initial conditions and resonant axion production at the string width scale. The total number density of axions produced from strings is $n_\text{ax}=1.66(17) f_\text{a}^2 H$, where $f_\text{a}$ is the axion decay constant and $H$ the Hubble rate. We report on axion production from the final collapse of the network in a future work.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating equilibrium with slow steady flow and the correct form of entropy current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with spherical symmetry as well as with steady energy flow is investigated perturbatively around the hydrostatic limit, where the radial component of the fluid velocity field $u^\mu$ is sufficiently small. Each component of vectors and tensors consisting of the system is expanded in different powers, which makes the covariant perturbation approach ineffective. The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\mu=au^\mu+ bj^\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions. To determine them, a new condition is proposed. This condition imposes the entropy current to be of an unconventional form $s^\mu=(s-bj^0)u^\mu/u^0+ bj^\mu$, where $s$ is the entropy density. The remaining parameter $b$ is fixed by the current conservation equation. The perturbative analysis shows that $b$ starts with the quadratic order and its leading term is determined explicitly.</description>

      <title>Completeness from Gravitational Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that symmetry in the presence of gravity implies a version of the completeness hypothesis. For a broad class of theories, we demonstrate that the existence of finitely many charged particles logically necessitates the existence of infinitely many charged particles populating the entire charge lattice. Our conclusions follow from the consistency of perturbative gravitational scattering and require the following ingredients: 1) a weakly coupled ultraviolet completion of gravity, 2) a nonabelian symmetry $G$, gauged or global, whose Cartan subgroup generates the abelian charge lattice, and 3) a spectrum containing some finite set of charged representations, in the simplest cases taken to be a single particle in the fundamental. Under these conditions, the abelian charge lattice is completely filled by single-particle states for $G=SO(N)$ with $N\geq 5$ and $G=SU(N)$ with $N\geq 3$, which in turn implies completeness for other symmetry groups such as $Spin(N)$, $Sp(N)$, and $E_8$. Curiously, a corollary of our results is that the $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories have precisely the minimal field content needed to derive completeness using our methodology.</description>

      <title>Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.</description>

      <title>X-ray Evolution of Young Stars: Early Dimming and Coronal Softening in Solar-Mass Stars with Implications for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first ~&lt;1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of &lt;25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters (~45--100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters (~220--750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by ~100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the ~&lt;750 Myr interval probed in this study.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dark matter origin of the halo-like 20 GeV $\gamma$-ray excess with the AMS-02 antiproton data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_\chi \sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $&lt; 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dispersion Spectra across Lorentz boosted frames: Spurious modes and the enigma of causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of linearized perturbations in relativistic field theories involving derivative corrections frequently leads to pathologies that, although generic, may not always be manifest, like in a local rest frame scenario. Hence, analyzing such theories conclusively in a more general state of equilibrium, like in a Lorentz boosted inertial frame, is imperative, albeit extracting the boosted modes could be quite nontrivial. Motivated by this problem, in this study, we develop a general framework for deriving the dispersion spectra in Lorentz-boosted inertial frames solely from the information of the local rest frame dispersion coefficients. Apart from the well-behaved modes, which are observed to follow an exact mapping across the boost, we show that in some cases, unphysical ``spurious" modes might turn up, which diverge at zero boost limit and thus lack any rest-frame analogue. Finally, we investigate the conflict between the existence of these spurious modes and the causality for a given relativistic theory. The key developments provided here are (i) a convenient way for obtaining the dispersion spectra across inertial frames, bypassing the traditional method of solving the boosted polynomial, and (ii) exploring the direct connection between the mode conservation and the causality of a theory with detailed proof. Due to the general approach, these results can find direct applications for a range of other effective theory formulations, like gauge theory plasmas, strongly coupled systems, and heavy quark effective theory.</description>

      <title>Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermal recoil jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the established paradigm of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jets from initial hard parton scatterings are suppressed due to their interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as they traverse the hot medium, serving as crucial tomographic probes of QGP properties. The QGP is also capable of absorbing and reprocessing energy deposited by the hard jets into emergent jet-like objects, providing a novel production mechanism of thermal recoil jets. These emergent thermal recoil jets exhibit distinct transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and jet-size ($R$) dependencies different from the hard jets, and naturally explain the puzzling observation of the enhanced yields of hadron or photon triggered jets at large azimuthal angle and solely at small $p_\mathrm{T}$ and large $R$. These thermal recoil jets are predicted to have unique substructures, such as their jet shape that increases with the radius and the thermal-like distribution of their constituents, which can be verified in future experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Relation between leading divergences in nonrenormalizable $4D$ supersymmetric theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an ${\cal N}=1$ nonrenormalizable supersymmetric gauge theory with the superpotential quartic in the chiral matter superfields. With the help of the Slavnov's higher covariant derivative regularization it is demonstrated that (in the lowest nontrivial order) the leading power divergent quantum correction to the gauge coupling constant is given by an integral of double total derivatives with respect to the loop momenta. The result obtained after calculating this integral turned out to be proportional to the corresponding quantum correction to the kinetic term of the matter superfields. More exactly, in the considered approximation the quadratically divergent contributions to the gauge coupling and to the kinetic term of the chiral matter superfields are related by an equation analogous to the exact NSVZ $\beta$-function for the renormalizable case.</description>

      <title>Improving the electromagnetic form factor of the pion at large $Q^2$ using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At large momentum transfer, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the form factor of the pion $F_\pi(Q^2)$ using lattice QCD simulations. Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \;\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \;\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Amplitudes from Cubic Scalar Feynman diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are the foremost tool in the perturbative study of quantum field theory. In gauge theories, the full potential of this tool is revealed when it is combined with the Slavanov-Taylor identities associated with the local gauge symmetry. Hence, it is desirable to have perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes that combine the graphical nature of Feynman diagram expansion and the reations among various diagrams due to the Slavanov-Taylor identities. In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation from a nearby subhalo candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis of pulsar timing data has reported evidence for a massive ($\sim 6 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$) dark matter subhalo located only $\sim 0.8$ kpc from Earth. This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,\AA\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</description>

      <title>PSR J0537-6910: Exponential recoveries detected for 12 glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\%$ of the total. We find that $\ddot\nu$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\ddot\nu$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of the six-derivative effective scalar-tensor theories, extending the four-derivative framework previously developed by Steven Weinberg. The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finiteness of de Sitter (dS) horizon entropy, we study how ``bra-ket wormholes'' modify correlation functions in gravitationally prepared states. Euclidean wormhole saddles in gravitational path integrals can generate non-factorizing contributions to correlation functions, as in replica-wormhole explanation of the Page curve and bra-ket-wormhole restoration of strong subadditivity. By defining `time' variables and computing observables in a flat region attached to the dS boundary, we evaluate bra-ket wormhole contributions to scalar two-point functions and find a late-time transition in the dominant saddle, accompanied by ramp-and-plateau behavior of correlations and characteristic timescale comparable to the fast scrambling. Our results are built upon (i) inflationary horizon exit and re-entry, (ii) enhancement of correlation at small comoving momentum $k$ by wormhole contribution, and (iii) a competition between mode counting and topological suppression that drives a transition to wormhole dominance. Although results are qualitatively consistent, one needs to address wormhole stabilization to clearly interpret in terms of the entropy context.</description>

Abstract: The production of single and paired lepton bound states in the decay of the Higgs boson has been studied. We explore different decay mechanisms that contribute significantly to the decay width. The decay widths are calculated taking into account relativistic corrections in the decay amplitude and in the wave function of the bound state of leptons.</description>

Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyzes them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis to evaluate the scaling exponent of the probability density function. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights. Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as the Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation for solar neutrino Levy flights.</description>

      <title>Higgs Potential from Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the Higgs potential, a key element in our understanding of Nature, is partially generated by the instantons of new confining dynamics, perhaps from a hidden sector. In this picture, while the Higgs itself is a fundamental field, it controls the strength of the non-perturbative interactions that give rise to its potential. We examine a simple setup in which this instanton contribution is augmented by a quartic term, which is sufficient for a realistic electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The minimum of the potential is given by the Lambert $W_0$ function, with these assumptions. We discuss the predictions of this model and how it may be tested through measurements of the Higgs self coupling. Given the connection with non-trivial dynamics, one may also consider the prospects of accessing hidden sector states at colliders; this seems to be typically challenging in our setup. Symmetry restoration in the early Universe in this scenario is briefly examined. We also comment on the possible connection of our general setup with recent work on the physics of field space end points.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the Higgs boson ($H_{125}$), discovered in 2012, remains a mystery. In the metric affine theory (MAT) framework, we study the scalar potential and investigate a couple of scenarios for the symmetry breaking mechanisms with a dilaton model which is derived from the geometry. The LHC constraints for the couplings of Yukawa couplings, Higgs-weak vector bosons and Higgs self-couplings, in this model are examined, which identify the parameter space where the discovered Higgs boson $m_h=125$ GeV can be dilaton-dominant and the features of Higgs self-couplings are explored. It is found that via the measurements of Higgs pair production, the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) running can either confirm or rule out the dilaton dominance.</description>

      <title>Impact of momentum-dependent drag coefficient on energy loss of charm and bottom quarks in QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the momentum of heavy particles affects their interaction rate, and the resulting drag coefficient in a quark-gluon plasma. To account for this momentum dependence, the drag coefficient is derived by expressing the energy loss coefficients as polynomial expansions of momentum ($p$). This approach allows for a more precise investigation of momentum dependence of drag coefficient by incorporating the linear terms of these expansions. Additionally, the influence of particle's momentum on radiative and collisional energy loss is more clearly determined. The study focuses on calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of charm and bottom quarks in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 5.02 \: TeV$. The initial distribution functions have been evolved numerically based on the Fokker-Planck equation. The results are compared with the latest data from ALICE and ATLAS experiments, conducted in 2021 and 2022.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum-field-theoretical study of bremsstrahlung from an electron propagating in a linearly polarized background photon field. Starting from the photon two-point correlator, the background-modified photon propagator is parameterized via transverse-momentum-dependent photon distributions. Coulomb correction is incorporated through a gauge-link formalism and soft-photon radiation is resummed with a Sudakov factor, yielding an analytic form of the polarized Bethe-Heitler spectrum. Numerical illustrations show a characteristic $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal modulation of a few percent in the differential distribution, with Sudakov suppression at low transverse momentum and mild Coulomb-induced enhancement at larger $q_\perp$.</description>

      <title>Spinor Representations for Fields with any Spin: Lorentz Tensor Basis for Operators and Covariant Multipole Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix elements for particles with higher spin $(j &gt; 1/2)$ using chiral representations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$ representations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\sigma^\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\leq m \leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the gluon propagator to be finite at $ g^{2}_{s} /4\pi \equiv \alpha \rightarrow \alpha_{\ast} $, where $ \alpha_{\ast} = \alpha (0) $, we derive its low-momentum asymptotics. In some cases the results modify the known ones. In our work, we also establish the field-theoretical nature of a universal phenomenological parameter introduced in works \cite{Alk} and determining the behaviour of Green's functions in the infrared region. The importance of studying the renormalization group parameters in the vicinity of the infrared stable point is emphasized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a dark matter scenario where a dark Z boson possessing mass mixing with the SM Z boson couples to the DM candidate and serves as the portal to the SM. The UV origin of the mass mixing in the form of an extra dark Higgs doublet and a scalar dark singlet provides new exotic scalars which can constitute the final state of DM annihilation during freeze-out. We find that existing constraints on the observed Higgs coupling strength, exotic Higgs searches and dark matter observables complement each other, while future searches for exotic Higgs decays and resonant heavy scalars at HL-LHC will be sensitive to part of the allowed parameter space.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <title>New resonances at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the large QCD background, t t spectroscopy is poorly doing at LHC with the exception of a toponium candidate hetat343 first observed with high statistical significance by CMS. Our previous work predicts a contribution at almost the same mass from a Kaluza Klein graviton T376. For heavy scalars, following ATLAS and CMS, we describe how the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms could produce a dip rather than a bump in the mass distribution, which prevents genuine searches for heavy resonances. It seems that the pseudo-scalar and scalar resonances A490 and H650, indicated by other channels, as described in our previous work, start to be visible in the t t channel in RUN2 analyses presented by ATLAS and CMS. Together with H650, the tensor resonance T690 allows to interpret nine statistically significant indications observed in that region of mass. The global significance of this effect is ~8 s.d. Perturbative unitarity requirements allow to predict W+W+ and ZW resonances which are indicated by LHC data. T690 seen as a KK graviton resonance allows to interpret a recent evidence for an excess in the four-top final state. It also predicts an excess of h125h125 final states measurable at HL-LHC. This scenario offers excellent prospects for abundantly (109 events) producing a sequence of narrow resonances at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. The present note summarises these arguments and describes available indications, complementing our collection of evidences for BSM resonances in view of electing a future collider.</description>

Abstract: Top quark electroweak interactions serve as a sensitive probe for beyond-Standard-Model physics, potentially exhibiting significant deviations from Standard Model predictions and offering crucial tests of fundamental symmetries in ultraviolet physics. This Letter investigates their measurement through deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes involving top quark loops at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. We demonstrate that left-handed electron beam polarization can significantly enhance DIS cross sections for these interactions compared to right-handed scenario, highlighting the pivotal role of high polarization at the EIC in constraining these couplings. Compared to direct $pp \to t\bar{t}Z$ measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), DIS measurements could significantly improve these coupling constraints and effectively resolve parameter space degeneracies present in LHC data. Moreover, the expected precision from the EIC's high-luminosity phase matches that of LEP electroweak precision measurements, underscoring the EIC's significant potential to probe top quark properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given that dark matter and normal matter are nontrivially unified in a grand unified theory, called dark grand unification, we derive novel residual theories at low energy explaining dark matter and neutrino mass. The first chain of which is $E_6\to SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes SU(3)_R$, which contains a matter parity by itself stabilizing a dark matter candidate and producing neutrino mass via a seesaw. The second chain is $\mathrm{Trinification}\to SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$, which results in a novel family-universal 3-3-1-1 model, opposite to the normal 3-3-1-1 (or corresponding 3-3-1) model. Surprisingly, it is a variant of both minimal 3-3-1 model and 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos since both $e_R$ and $\nu_R$ are located at the bottoms of lepton triplets. Since this universal 3-3-1-1 model is properly embedded in the trinification, the above matter parity works governing dark matter stability as well as suppressing unwanted fermion mixings. Further, neutrino masses are naturally generated by a canonical seesaw combined with a scotogenic scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong-force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin-correlation observable as a sensitive probe to separate strong-force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision-energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of the net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>

Abstract: An exploratory study of the exclusive production of a vector - toponium $\psi_t$ state by photon - hadron interactions is performed considering proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) energies. The scattering amplitude is calculated using the $k_T$ - factorization formalism assuming that the vector - toponium state can be described by a Gaussian light-cone wave function and considering different models for the unintegrated gluon distribution. Predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross - sections are presented.

      <title>Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Null Results in the Direct Detection Experiments, $(g-2)_\ell$ and Neutrino Mass in an Extended $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ Model Constrained through the $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Direct Detection~(DD) experiments are vital for probing the particle nature of Dark Matter~(DM). However, in the absence of a scattering event, DD searches result in stringent bounds on the corresponding parameter space. The paper has considered a $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$-extension of the Standard Model~(SM) and augmented the particle spectrum with $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector-like leptons and scalars. A discrete $Z_2$ symmetry stabilizes the lightest SM-singlet vector-like lepton as the viable DM candidate. In the proposed model, amplitude-level cancellation can be achieved for both DM-electron and DM-quark scatterings, leading to a trivial explanation for the continuous null results in the DD experiments. The framework can also induce one-loop corrections to the lepton anomalous magnetic moments and $Z\ell^+\ell^-$ couplings. The experimental bounds on the $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays are instrumental in constraining the model parameters. Particularly, using the $Z\to\tau^+\tau^-$ decay, a stronger exclusion limit can be imposed on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ parameter space. Further, in the presence of three heavy right-handed neutrinos, transforming as $Z_2$-even states, the model can explain all the neutrino mass and mixing constraints using the Type-I seesaw mechanism. Future experimental updates on the $(g-2)_\ell$, $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays and improved bounds on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ theory can be crucial to test the proposed model. Moreover, future DD experiments searching for a DM-muon scattering might be significant to probe the considered DM-SM interaction.</description>

      <title>A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B_0$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current flows only at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with small conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the electric current flows inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the power $P$ is estimated as $P\simeq 5.7\times 10^{-27}\mbox{W}g_{\gamma}^2 \Big(\frac{L}{100\mbox{cm}}\Big)\Big(\frac{R}{6\mbox{cm}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{B_0}{15\mbox{T}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{m_a}{10^{-4}\mbox{eV}}\Big)\Big(\frac{10}{\epsilon}\Big)\Big(\frac{\rho_a}{0.3\rm GeVcm^{-3}}\Big)$ with radius $R$, length $L$, permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}$ is model dependent parameter; $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. The detection of dark matter axions in our method may be feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ into $\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the factorization framework. Employing this framework and incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute the tree-level decay amplitudes and decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the decay widths and branching fractions for all relevant weak channels. This study complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ reported in Ref. [1], thereby providing a comprehensive investigation of all possible $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Daisy Chain: Running and the 3D EFT View of Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have recently observed a stochastic gravitational wave background at nano-Hertz frequencies. This raises the question whether the signal can be of primordial origin. Supercooled first-order phase transitions are among the few early Universe scenarios that can successfully explain it. To further scrutinise this possibility, a precise theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the phase transition is required. Here we perform such an analysis for a dark sector with an Abelian Higgs model in the conformal limit, which is known to admit large supercooling. We compare simple analytic parametrisations of the bounce action, one-loop finite temperature calculations including Daisy resummation, and results of a dimensionally reduced (3D) effective theory including up to two-loop corrections using the DRalgo framework. Consistent renormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the couplings is essential for a meaningful interpretation of the results. We find that the 3D EFT with consistent expansion in the 4D parameters gives a significantly reduced scale dependence of the phase transition parameters. With a suitable choice of RGE scale, the 4D high temperature expanded effective potential yields results consistent with the 3D calculations, while the analytic parametrisation deviates significantly in the limit of large supercooling.</description>

      <title>RG evolution and effect of intermediate new-physics on $\Delta B=1$ four-fermion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the stringent experimental bounds on proton lifetime and the need for precise low-energy predictions, there has been renewed interest in the renormalization group (RG) evolution of Wilson coefficients for baryon number violating (BNV) operators and their characteristic new-physics scales. In this work, we analyze the RG running of dimension-6 four-fermion operators in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme that mediate nucleon decay channels such as $p \to e^+ \pi^0$, while systematically accounting for the impact of baryon number conserving (BNC) new-physics that can enter the theory at an intermediate scale as higher-dimensional effective field theory operator. These BNC operators mix with BNV ones at 1-loop and alter the RG flow. The running is performed from the electroweak scale up to representative intermediate scales of $10^4~\text{GeV}$, $10^6~\text{GeV}$, and $10^9~\text{GeV}$, corresponding to possible thresholds for new BNC degrees of freedom. Comparing the RG evolved coefficients with current experimental bounds on nucleon decay lifetimes, we find that the inclusion of BNC-BNV mixing, dominated by top quark loops, can significantly lower the effective proton decay scale to $\sim 10^7$ GeV, thus mitigating the need of a large desert. A Python package is provided to facilitate the RG evolution of nucleon-decay Wilson coefficients, allowing for the inclusion of generic BNC effects.</description>

Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Compared to our earlier study [K.-F. Ye et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, 035201 (2024)], which considered only the color-singlet processes, the present work includes both the color-singlet and color-octet contributions within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework. In addition to NRQCD, we also consider the contributions from the cluster collapse and weak decays of $b$-hadrons. We find that the simulated inclusive $J/\psi$ transverse momentum differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. We provide a quantitative analysis of the relative contributions for different production mechanisms and their energy and rapidity dependence in the inclusive $J/\psi$ production. Furthermore, we offer a quantification of the relative contributions of the various components and their energy and rapidity dependence in the NRQCD channels, including the direct production via the hard scattering and the feed-down from the decays of heavier charmonium states such as $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, and $\chi_{c2}$. Finally, we examine the effects of partonic and hadronic rescatterings and offer the quantitative estimate of their impact on the $J/\psi$ production. These results are entirely new and represent a significant step forward in understanding the mechanisms of the inclusive $J/\psi$ production in high-energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of the $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_c$ charmed baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the radiative decays of the $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_c$ charmed baryons, which belong to the flavor sextet ($\bf {6}_{\rm F}$), within the constituent quark model formalism. The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the ground and $P$-wave states to ground states, as well as from the second shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances when strong decays are not allowed. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for identifying resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. A relevant case is the $\Omega_c (3327)$ state, whose branching ratios between the strong decay channels are comparable; thus, the radiative decay widths may help assign this state. We also make the assignment of the recently discovered $\Xi'_c(2923)^{+}$ baryon, which is consistent with being the isospin partner of the $\Xi'_c(2923)^{0}$. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_\rho$-wave states, $\rho-\lambda$ mixed states, and $\rho$-mode radially excited states in the charm sector. Throughout our calculations, we account for uncertainties arising from both experimental and model-dependent errors.</description>

      <title>The Dichotomous Nature of the $\sigma$ Meson and the Nucleon D-Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing a symmetry-preserving contact-interaction formulation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we examine the identity of the $\sigma$ meson and its implications for the gravitational structure of hadrons. In this framework, the scalar meson emerges as the chiral partner of the pion, with both states' properties tightly connected to the mechanisms of mass generation in QCD. We find that, above a critical coupling that triggers dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the D-terms of the constituent quark, the pion, and $\sigma$ saturate at fixed values $D_{q,\pi,\sigma}=-1/3,-1,-7/3$. By examining the coupling strength evolution of the D-terms, this pattern follows naturally once a dual nature for the $\sigma$ meson is recognized: it behaves both as a quark-antiquark composite and as a dilaton arising from spontaneous scale symmetry breaking. This unified picture yields the prediction $D_N\sim -3$ for the nucleon D-term, consistent with contemporary lattice-QCD, continuum, and dispersive studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present thesis, the author reviews the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions that may have occured shortly after the Big Bang. Such transitions proceed via the nucleation and expansion of true vacuum bubbles and give rise to a rich phenomenology, for instance the emission of a stochastic gravitational-wave background caused by bubble collisions. The author discusses, in depth, the formalism of the effective scalar potential and its different contributions in the loop expansion, points out the necessary ingredients for a first-order transition, and assesses the detectability of the associated gravitational-wave spectrum via future space-based observatories and pulsar timing arrays. He then applies the the developed phenomenological toolbox to investigate the detection prospect for phase transitions in the context of specific theories such as the Vev Flip-Flop (a dark matter mechanism) and the Dark Photon Model.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent EFT result from CMS is presented, combining differential cross section and direct EFT measurements performed by the CMS Collaboration across four branches of the Standard Model: top, Higgs, electroweak and QCD physics. To maximize the sensitivity, measurements of electroweak precision observables from LEP and SLC are included as well. 64 Wilson Coefficients (WC) are targeted in this combined measurement, both individually and with a simultaneous fit to 42 linear combinations of the Wilson Coefficients.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Hadron Production in Open-charm Meson Pair at $e^+e^-$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is a well-established theoretical framework, yet several unresolved issues remain that warrant further experimental and theoretical exploration. In the realm of quark physics, these include understanding the nature of quark confinement and elucidating the mechanism linking quarks and gluons to strongly interacting particles within the standard model theory, which may offer insights into the underlying physics mechanisms. These inquiries can be addressed through the study of hadrons produced at $e^+e^-$ collisions and decaying to open-charm meson pairs utilizing the capabilities of {\it BABAR}, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments, which have yielded valuable insights into non-standard hadrons over recent decades. This Colloquium examines the contributions of $e^+e^-$ colliders from {\it BABAR}, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments to such studies in the past two decades and discusses future prospects for $e^+e^-$ collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Measuring short-range correlations and quasi-elastic cross sections in A(e,e') at x&gt;1 and modest Q$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from the Jefferson Lab E08-014 experiment, investigating short-range correlations (SRC) through measurements of inclusive quasi-elastic scattering from $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ca. The kinematics were selected to isolate scattering from SRCs, yielding a plateau in the A/$^2$H cross-section ratios due to the universal two-body structure of the 2N-SRCs in light and heavy nuclei. We observe approximate plateaus in the A/$^2$H ratios and provide the first extractions of the A/$^2$H ratio for $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. We also examine the A/$^3$He ratio, aiming to identify three-nucleon SRCs (3N-SRCs). Following the approach for isolating 2N-SRCs, searching for 3N-SRC dominance involved measuring the A/$^3$He cross section ratio at modest-to-large $Q^2$ values and looking for a plateau ratios for $x \gtorder 2.5$. This was not observed in the data, and in fact increasing $Q^2$ values moved the data \textit{further away} from the predicted plateau. We show here that, when analyzed in terms of the struck nucleon's light-cone momentum, the data exhibited the expected trend, progressively approaching the predicted 3N-SRC plateau. These observations suggest that future measurements at higher energies may facilitate a definitive isolation and identification of 3N-SRCs.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation when the size of SUSY breaking is much smaller than the dynamical scale ($m \ll \Lambda$). We show empirical evidence that the near-SUSY limit is continuously connected to the non-SUSY limit ($m \gg \Lambda$) in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental representation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N_f/N_c \gtrsim O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Electron-antineutrino spectrum from precision measurements of $^{144}$Pr-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $^{144}$Ce -- $^{144}$Pr electron antineutrino source is one of the most suitable radiochemical sources for experiments searching for the oscillations of active neutrinos to the light sterile state. In the current work the $\beta$-spectra of $^{144}\rm{Ce}$ -- ${^{144}\rm{Pr}}$ source have been measured by two types of $\beta$-spectrometers based on silicon Si(Li) detectors in order to determine the energy spectrum of electron anti-neutrino emitted in the $\beta$-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei. The nuclear shape factor of the ground state beta transition in ${^{144}\rm{Pr}}-{^{144}\rm{Nd}}$ has been obtained with high precision: $C(W) = 1 + (-0.0301 \pm 0.0007)W + (-0.101 \pm 0.006)W^{-1}$. The reduced cross section for the inverse beta decay reaction on hydrogen for the $\rm{{^{144}Pr}}$ electron anti-neutrino source has been defined as $\rm{(4.7344 \pm 0.0006_{stat} \pm 0.013_{syst}) \times 10^{-44}~cm^2 {decay}^{-1}}$ that provides sufficient sensitivity to search for a sterile neutrino with a mass of $m_4 \sim 1$~eV and a mixing angle $Sin^2(2\theta_{14}) \sim 0.005$ using standard disappearance method.</description>

      <title>Seeing through the confinement screen: DGLAP/BFKL mixing and light-ray matching in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that collider observables such as hadron number flux can be matched onto a linear combination of detectors/light-ray operators in perturbative QCD. The spectrum of detectors in QCD is subtle, due to recombination between the DGLAP and BFKL trajectories. We explain how to define and renormalize these trajectories at one-loop, systematically incorporating their recombination. The leading and subleading soft gluon theorems play an important role, and our analysis suggests the presence of an infinite series of further subleading soft theorems for squared-amplitudes/form factors. Combined with our light-ray matching hypothesis, the anomalous dimensions of recombined DGLAP/BFKL detectors yield a prediction for the energy dependence of the number of particles in a jet, as well as other predictions for more general energy-weighted hadron measurements. We compare these predictions to Monte-Carlo simulations, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint multiband detection of intermediate-mass black holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</description>

      <title>Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new method for computing gravitational-wave emission from nonspinning binaries which systematically unifies the various integrals arising in the Fourier expansions of post-Newtonian dynamics, providing a simple, practical scheme for calculations at arbitrary precision. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, when radiation-reaction effects is not included, we found that the tail contribution to the energy and angular momentum fluxes can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression with the help of the new method. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the Minkovski limit. The latter expansion reveals that the Minkovski approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Effects of mean-field momentum dependence on pion production in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies provides an important probe of the collision dynamics and nuclear matter equation of state, especially the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential, we investigate the effects of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials on the pion production in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$~GeV/nucleon. We find that a stronger momentum dependence, for which the nucleon mean-field potentials increase faster with momentum, generally suppresses pion production. This feature can be understood in terms of the mean-field-induced modification of nucleon high-momentum phase space during the compression stage: a stronger momentum dependence can reduce the relative fraction of high-momentum nucleons in heavy-ion collisions, thereby suppressing the production of $\Delta$ resonances and pions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). Through a joint Bayesian analysis, we perform a cosmological comparative assessment of the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL models with the phenomenological IDE model. For the phenomenological IDE model in a flat universe with \emph{Fermi} samples and DESI DR2, we obtain: $\xi=2.63^{+0.63}_{-0.52}$, $\xi + 3w_X = -0.98^{+1.90}_{-2.07}$ with the GOLD sample ($1.4\le z \le5.6$) and $\xi=2.83^{+0.63}_{-0.58}$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0.03^{+1.35}_{-1.33}$ with the FULL sample ($1.4\le z \le8.2$), respectively. Our analysis shows that the $\Lambda$CDM model without interaction ($\xi=3$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0$) is consistent with the latest \emph{Fermi} sample and DESI DR2 at $1\sigma$ confidence level. We find no significant deviations from the standard model using AIC and BIC criterias.</description>
