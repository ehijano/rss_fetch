      <title>Microscopic origin of the magnetic interactions and their experimental signatures in altermagnetic La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently introduced type of magnets, with no net magnetization like antiferromagnets, but displaying a non-relativistic Zeeman splitting in reciprocal space like ferromagnets. One of the lately discussed models to realize AM is the inverse Lieb lattice (ILL). Initially suggested as a purely theoretical construct, the ILL occurs in real materials such as La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. However, AM on the ILL requires 90$^\circ$ nearest-neighbor superexchange to be {\it antiferromagnetic} and dominant over the 180$^\circ$ next-nearest-neighbor superexchange, in apparent contradiction to the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules. Yet, AM ordering was found to be the ground state in La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. Combining ab initio and analytical methods, we determine how direct exchange and superexchange act together to produce a large antiferromagnetic nearest-neigbor coupling. The seeming contradiction with the GKA rules is traced back to the multiorbital character of Mn$^{+2}$ ions. By calculating magnon bands, we identify universal signatures of the exchange interactions, suggesting experimental fingerprints.</description>

      <title>Excitation-detector principle and the algebraic theory of planon-only abelian fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study abelian planon-only fracton orders: a class of three-dimensional (3d) gapped quantum phases in which all fractional excitations are abelian particles restricted to move in planes with a common normal direction. In such systems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a finitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^\pm]$ equipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of remote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with another planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability, we observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to propose the $\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of gapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires that every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in the normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We prove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of excitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To justify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon theory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a transverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and only if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector principle gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we conjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for finitely generated torsion-free modules over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\pm]$, where $p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards classifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of prime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon theories.</description>

      <title>Designer Heavy Fermions in Incommensurate $\bf{Nb_3Cl_8}$/Graphene van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy fermion systems, traditionally realized in rare-earth compounds with limited tunability, have hindered systematic exploration of correlated quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce a general strategy for engineering heavy fermions in incommensurate van der Waals heterostructures by coupling a Mott insulator (Nb$_3$Cl$_8$) with itinerant electrons (from monolayer graphene), circumventing strict lattice-matching requirements. Through magnetotransport and slave spin mean-field calculations, we demonstrate the hybridization gap ($\Delta\approx30$ meV), gate-tunable metal-insulator transition, and band-selective electron effective mass enhancement, hallmarks of Kondo coherence. The heterostructure exhibits nearly order-of-magnitude electron effective mass dichotomy between hybridized and conventional graphene-like regimes, alongside in-plane magnetic field-induced metal-insulator transitions. Top gate-temperature phase mapping reveals competing correlated states, including insulating and hidden-order phases. This work establishes a scalable platform for designing heavy fermion by replacing the itinerant electron materials, with implications for engineering topological superconductivity and quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic and magneto-transport properties in non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semimetal GdGaSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the magneto-transport and magnetic properties of GdGaSi, having non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure, with space group $I4_1md$. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental studies. First-principles calculations reveal that GdGaSi is an antiferromagnetic semimetallic system, characterized by dominant electron-type charge carriers. In addition, the possible nontriviality of the crossing at the Fermi energy is consistent with isostructural LaPtSi-structured materials. The compound shows robust antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a N\'eel temperature of 19 K, and spin-reorientation signature below $T_N$. The semimetallic nature with positive magnetoresistance ($\simeq$ 2\% at 2 K and 8 T) is observed from the magnetotransport data, having electrons as majority charge carrier, established from the Hall measurements. The strong correlation in magnetism and transport is supported by various observations, like (1) concordant transitions in $M(T)$ and $\rho (T)$ data, (2) change in the concentration and mobility of electron below $T_N$, and (3) splitting of Kohler's plots in the two branches across the transition. Thus, our findings establish GdGaSi as a material with intertwined magnetic and transport degrees of freedom, within noncentrosymmetric lattice.</description>

      <title>From Density Functional Theory to Spin Hamiltonians: Magnetism in $d^5$ Honeycomb Compound OsCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in strongly correlated honeycomb systems with $d^5$ electronic configuration has garnered significant attention due to its potential to realize the Kitaev spin liquid state, characterized by exotic properties. However, real materials exhibit not only Kitaev exchange interactions but also other magnetic exchanges, which may drive the transition from a spin liquid phase to a long-range ordered ground state. This work focuses on modelling the effective spin Hamiltonian for two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb magnetic systems with $d^5$ electronic configurations. The Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian equipped with spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations is considered where onsite energies and hopping parameters, preserving the crystal symmetry, are extracted from the first principles Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Exact diagonalization (ED) calculations for the HK Hamiltonian on a two-site cluster are performed to construct the effective magnetic Hamiltonian. The ground-state magnetic properties are explored using the semi-classical Luttinger-Tisza approach. As a representative case, the magnetic ground state of the $d^5$ honeycomb system OsCl$_3$ is investigated, and the variation of magnetic exchange parameters with respect to the correlation strength (U) and Hund's coupling ($J_H$) is analyzed. The magnetic ground state exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering for a chosen value of $U$ and $J_H$, consistent with DFT results. This study provides insight into the magnetism of OsCl$_3$ and offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional energy-based methods for calculating exchange interactions for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Kondo physics in the Anderson Impurity Model with two-body losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dissipative version of the Anderson Impurity model, where an interacting impurity is coupled to a fermionic reservoir and exposed to Markovian dissipation in the form of two-body losses. Using a self-consistent hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function. We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate, displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed by strong correlations or strong losses.</description>

      <title>Skyrmions of Frustrated Quantum Dimer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected solitons observed in various classes of real magnets. In two-dimensional systems, where the target space of local magnetization values is the two-sphere $S^2$, skyrmion textures are classified by the homotopy classes of two-loops $S^2$ in $S^2$: $\Pi_2(S^2) \cong Z$. Here, we demonstrate that more general topological skyrmion textures emerge in the classical limit of quantum dimer systems, where the phase space of the relevant classical theory is $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (with $N=4$ for the case of interest), because the relevant second homotopy group, $\Pi_2(\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}) \cong Z$ for $N\geq 2$, remains unchanged. Building on the framework established by Zhang et al. (2023), we consider a classical limit based on SU(4) coherent states, which preserve intra-dimer entanglement. We show that the zero-temperature phase diagram of frustrated spin-dimer systems on a bilayer triangular lattice with weak inter-dimer coupling includes two magnetic-field-induced $\mathbb{CP}^{3}$ skyrmion crystal phases.</description>

      <title>Site-polarized Mott phases competing with a correlated metal in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions, and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties. In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using our developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on 1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{\alpha}$ with varying exponent $\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Correlation Enhanced Electron-Phonon Coupling in FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ at a Magic Angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a predictive theory for unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based superconductors remains elusive, an extensively debated aspect is the interaction between phonons and strongly correlated electrons, and its potential role in the pairing mechanism. Here, through the combination of first principles dynamical mean field theory calculations and epitaxial growth of the single-layer FeX (X=Se, S, Te) on SrTiO$_3$ (STO)(001) substrate, which facilitates the controlled distortion of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron, we demonstrate an unique superconducting dome where the superconducting gap peaks at a `magic' angle of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) for the A$_{1g}$ mode is maximized for the FeSe film. Our findings uncover a significant role of electronic correlations in strengthening Cooper pairing in unconventional superconductors by enhancing EPC.</description>

      <title>The Chern character of the Laughlin vector bundle in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin by explaining how a physical problem of studying the quantum Hall effect on a closed surface $C$ leads, via Laughlin's approach, to a mathematical question of describing the rank and the first Chern class of a particular vector bundle on the Picard group ${\rm Pic}^g(C)$. Then we formulate and solve the problem mathematically, proving several important conjectures made by physicists, in particular the Wen-Niu topological degeneracy conjecture and the Wen-Zee shift formula.
  Let $C$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus~$g$ and $S^NC$ its $N$th symmetric power. The product $C \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ carries a universal line bundle. On the product $C^N \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$ we consider the product of $N$ pull-backs of this universal line bundle and twist it by a power of the diagonal on $C^N$. The resulting line bundle descends onto $S^NC \times {\rm Pic}^d(C)$. Its push-forward (as a sheaf) to ${\rm Pic}^d(C)$ is a vector bundle that we call Laughlin's vector bundle. We determine all the Chern characters of the Laughlin vector bundle via a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch calculation.</description>

      <title>Dipoles and Anyonic Directional Confinement via Twisted Toric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility. We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators.
  We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</description>

      <title>A Generic Platform for Designing Fractional Chern Insulators: Electrostatically Engineered Rashba Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generic platform for designing topological flat bands through applying an artificially designed electrostatic superlattice potential to a thin film with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing many-body exact diagonalization, we show that the lowest flat band can host fractional Chern insulator states at filling factor $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$. Notably, these fractional charge states present robustly in a broad regime of the parameter space. We further discuss the potential realistic materials and the associated experimental conditions required to realize these compelling theoretical predictions. Our findings establish a versatile platform for engineering topological flat bands and exploring topologically nontrivial correlated states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometric dipole: a topological boost to flavor ferromagnetism in flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust flavor-polarized phases are a striking hallmark of many flat-band moir\'e materials. In this work, we trace the origin of this spontaneous polarization to a previously overlooked quantum-geometric quantity: the quantum-geometric dipole. Analogous to how the quantum metric governs the spatial spread of wavepackets, we show that the quantum-geometric dipole sets the characteristic size of particle-hole excitations, e.g. magnons in a ferromagnet, which in turn boosts their gap and stiffness. Indeed, the larger the particle-hole separation, the weaker the mutual attraction, and the stronger the excitation energy. In topological bands, this energy enhancement admits a lower bound within the single-mode approximation, highlighting the crucial role of topology in flat-band ferromagnetism. We illustrate these effects in microscopic models, emphasizing their generality and relevance to moir\'e materials. Our results establish the quantum-geometric dipole as a predictive geometric indicator for ferromagnetism in flat bands, a crucial prerequisite for topological order.</description>

      <title>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R\'enyi entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems, non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Boundary phase transitions of two-dimensional quantum critical XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Feature of Quantum Many-Body Scar States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamical correlations of nonintegrable systems with quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states generated by a ladder operator. The spectral function of the ladder operator has an exact $\delta$-function peak induced by the QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of two-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a $\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\pi$ and a continuum spectrum elsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other spin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the (approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction between overscreened spins in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3 driving the system to a new quantum critical point with anomalous dimensions $\frac{1}{ (N+1)} $ for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between the electronic and structural degrees of freedom is central to several intriguing phenomena observed in condensed-matter physics. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom, resulting in magnetoelastic coupling, which is typically small and only detectable in macroscopic samples. Here we demonstrate a giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish an effective control of magnetism in the surface layer and utilize it to probe the impact of magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We further determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, which exhibits giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, revealing how electronic correlations result in a strong electron-lattice coupling.</description>

      <title>Swapping exchange and spin-orbit induced correlated phases in proximitized Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to logical $C^{n-1}Z$ gates in $n$ copies of quantum codes via the $n$-fold cup product in the usual color code paradigm, as well as several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the color code paradigm, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries. We further construct logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. This is an example for a correlated hopping model where chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter and find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard patterns in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero-energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity in doped correlated band insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the superconducting properties of the bilayer Hubbard model, which exhibits a high transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) for an $s_{\pm}$ pairing, using a cluster extension of the dynamical mean-field theory. Unlike the single-layer Hubbard model, where the $d$-wave superconductivity emerges by doping the Mott insulator, the parent state of the bilayer system is a correlated band insulator. Above $T_{\rm c}$, slight hole (electron) doping introduces a striking dichotomy between electron and hole pockets: the electron (hole) pocket develops a pseudogap while the other becomes a nearly incipient band. We reveal that the superconductivity is driven by kinetic (potential) energy gain in the underdoped (overdoped) region. We also find a very short coherence length, for which we argue the relevance to multi-orbital physics. Our study offers crucial insights into the superconductivity in the bilayer Hubbard model potentially relevant to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>
