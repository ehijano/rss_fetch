      <title>Operating advanced scientific instruments with AI agents that learn on the job</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced scientific user facilities, such as next generation X-ray light sources and self-driving laboratories, are revolutionizing scientific discovery by automating routine tasks and enabling rapid experimentation and characterizations. However, these facilities must continuously evolve to support new experimental workflows, adapt to diverse user projects, and meet growing demands for more intricate instruments and experiments. This continuous development introduces significant operational complexity, necessitating a focus on usability, reproducibility, and intuitive human-instrument interaction. In this work, we explore the integration of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), as a transformative tool to achieve this goal. We present our approach to developing a human-in-the-loop pipeline for operating advanced instruments including an X-ray nanoprobe beamline and an autonomous robotic station dedicated to the design and characterization of materials. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of various LLMs as trainable scientific assistants for orchestrating complex, multi-task workflows, which also include multimodal data, optimizing their performance through optional human input and iterative learning. We demonstrate the ability of AI agents to bridge the gap between advanced automation and user-friendly operation, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>afspm: A Framework for Manufacturer-Agnostic Automation in Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component.</description>

      <title>The potential applications of muography to revealing sea shipwrecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon imaging, a non-invasive technique leveraging naturally occurring cosmic muons, has emerged as a promising tool for exploring underwater objects, including shipwrecks. This article examines the potential of muon imaging to investigate the contents of wrecked ships in the Baltic Sea and other marine environments. By analyzing the principles of muon tomography, its applications in underwater archaeology, and its advantages over traditional methods, we highlight its potential to reveal hidden details within shipwrecks while addressing challenges posed by the marine environment. These wrecks pose significant environmental risks due to their hazardous contents, such as explosives and crude oil products, making their detection and monitoring a matter of environmental and safety concern. Accurate modeling and imaging of such wrecks are crucial for assessing potential dangers and mitigating environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of 478-keV prompt gamma rays from boron neutron capture reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate imaging and quantitative measurement of 478-keV prompt gamma rays are critical for advancing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a promising cancer treatment. Although numerical simulations have indicated that such measurements are feasible, their practical application has proven challenging. This study introduces a gamma-ray imaging detector designed specifically for precise BNCT measurements. Using boron-rich phantom samples, we successfully imaged 478-keV gamma rays and established a linear correlation between gamma-ray production and boron concentration. Furthermore, applying this technique in a recognized BNCT treatment facility demonstrated the detector's effectiveness in monitoring boron dose distribution during neutron irradiation, both in pretreatment diagnostics and throughout the treatment process.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of the Intermediate Silicon Tracker for sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT), a two-layer barrel silicon strip tracker, is a key component of the tracking system for sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The INTT is designed to enable the association of reconstructed tracks with individual RHIC bunch crossings. To evaluate the performance of preproduction INTT ladders and the readout chain, a beam test was conducted at the Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science, Tohoku University, Japan. This paper presents the performance of the INTT evaluated through studies of the signal-to-noise ratio, residual distribution, spatial resolution, hit-detection efficiency, and multiple track reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Comparison calibration system for digital-output infrasound sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have enabled the application of digital-output MEMS modules in infrasound monitoring. These modules, combining MEMS pressure sensors and microcontrollers, provide timestamped digital pressure data. Compared with conventional analog infrasound sensors, the affordability and compactness of MEMS modules allow the construction of infrasound monitoring networks with a high density of measurement stations. However, dynamic frequency response characteristics of the MEMS modules, including both sensitivity modulus and phase, remain unassessed. In this study, we developed a comparison calibration system for digital-output infrasound sensors, with special attention paid to ensuring phase synchronization between the analog-output of reference standards and the digital-output of MEMS modules. Using a pulse per second signal synchronized with a time frequency standard, we successfully timestamped the reference analog signals, achieving synchronization between reference analog standards and digital-output sensors. Example calibrations were conducted on a digital-output MEMS module consisting of a DPS310 MEMS pressure sensor and an ESP32 microcontroller, in the 0.2 Hz to 4 Hz range. The sensitivity modulus matched the reference within a few percent, but the phase delayed by approximately 10 ms. We anticipate that the appliying corrections based on the results reported herein will enhance the reliability of infrasound measurements with digital-output sensors.</description>

      <title>A new diffuse reflector filament for additive manufacturing of 3D printing finely-segmented plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development and characterization of a novel white reflective filament suitable for additive manufacturing of finely segmented plastic scintillators using 3D printing. The filament is based on polycarbonate (PC) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymers loaded with titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to enhance reflectivity. A range of filament compositions and thicknesses was evaluated through optical reflection and transmittance measurements. Reflective layers were made by using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique. A 3D-segmented plastic scintillator prototype was made with fused injection modeling (FIM) and tested with cosmic rays to assess the light yield and the optical crosstalk. The results demonstrate the feasibility of producing compact and modular 3D-printed scintillator detectors with a performance analogous to standard plastic scintillator detectors, with lower light crosstalk, thus higher light yield, compared to past works, owing to the improved optical properties of the reflector material.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-tunable femtosecond pulsed laser for the characterisation of solid-state sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) process provides an excellent method for the characterisation of solid-state sensors due to its intrinsic 3D resolution for the excitation of electron-hole pairs. This paper presents the commissioning of a system composed of a Light Conversion PHAROS laser read out with an ORPHEUS optical parametric amplifier with tuneable output wavelength across $310-16000$~nm. This is one of the few facilities suitable for particle physics detector applications with a very wide wavelength range and ultra short pulses (150~fs at 1550~nm and 405~nm). The voxel characterisation shows a Rayleigh length of $12.20 \pm 0.47$ $~\upmu$m and the beam radius at the waist of $1.53 \pm 0.04$~$\upmu$m. Initial measurements with silicon and diamond samples are described. The apparatus is characterised with both devices, demonstrating the expected quadratic dependency with the energy per pulse, and different models are presented to explain the signal generated due to reflection. The signal generated in the silicon diode is in good agreement with one dimension voxel model predictions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of SiPMs at 40 K for neutrino coherent detection based on pure CsI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), as the core photoelectric sensor for coherent neutrino detection in low-temperature pure CsI, its working performance directly determines the measurement accuracy of the scintillator light yield. Our previous research has fully demonstrated the performance of pure CsI at liquid nitrogen temperature. More intriguingly, its performance is expected to be even better at 40 K. However, the performance characteristics of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range still remain to be explored. In this study, a self-developed adjustable temperature control system ranging from 30 K to 293 K was built to investigate the key performance parameters of SiPM at different temperatures, such as single photoelectron spectrum, gain, breakdown voltage, dark count rate, after-pulse, internal crosstalk, and single photoelectron resolution. Special emphasis was placed on examining the key performance parameters of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range to evaluate its feasibility for light yield measurement in this temperature range. The results show that this study obtained the parameter variation trends and optimal working conditions of 3 types of SiPM at different temperatures, thereby improving the sensitivity of the detector. This research provides important technical support for low-temperature detection in neutrino physics experiments.</description>

      <title>First-principles response simulation of wide-gap CdTe-DSDs for the FOXSI solar sounding rocket experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a wide-gap CdTe double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD) for the fourth and fifth flights of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager sounding rocket experiment (FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5). This detector features a 30 um strip width and a variable gap width from 30 um to 70 um, enabling position resolution finer than the strip pitch by inducing charge sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and utilizing this shared energy information for position reconstruction. However, this wide-gap configuration introduces complex detector responses, such as charge loss in the gap regions and electric field distortion near the electrodes, requiring a more advanced modeling approach for interpreting observation results in FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5 and for further optimization of future detector design. To address these complexities, we have constructed a first-principles simulation framework to model the detector response. The simulation integrates Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations of energy deposition, finite element calculations of electric and weighting fields using COMSOL Multiphysics, charge transport modeling incorporating trapping and diffusion, and calculation of the induced charge on the electrodes based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem. By introducing a surface conductive layer, which causes electric field distortion, the model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed charge loss on the cathode side. In addition, the model reproduces the distinct charge sharing behavior on the cathode and anode sides. These results validate the effectiveness of the model in characterizing the wide-gap CdTe-DSD.</description>

      <title>A matter of perspective: how nanoscale optical defects limit cosmic-scale gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, have revolutionised as- tronomy. Now, future detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer aim to achieve even greater sensitivity. Advanced optical simulations are crucial to overcoming the challenges faced by these complex in- terferometers. Finesse, the leading interferometer simulation tool in the GW community, supports the design and commissioning of these detectors by modeling optical, quantum, and mechanical effects. A key focus is understanding optical defects that distort the shape of the laser light and limit detector performance. This work explores how nanoscale defects affect GW observations and presents recent advancements in modeling their effects to guide the development of next-generation detector optics.</description>

      <title>A Spin-Based Pathway to Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.</description>

      <title>A Practical Flake Segmentation and Indexing Pipeline for Automated 2D Material Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and imaging conditions.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis of DECAL Sensor Noise for the Generation of Truly Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore here the stochastic behavior of the DECAL sensor's noise output, and we evaluate its potential application as a true random number generator (TRNG) using time series analysis. The main objectives are twofold: first, to characterize the intrinsic noise properties of the DECAL sensor in the absence of external stimuli, and second, to determine the feasibility of employing the sensor as a source of randomness. The collected sensor data are examined through statistical and time series methodologies, and subsequently modeled using an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. This modeling approach enables the transformation of the sensor's raw noise into a Gaussian white noise sequence, which serves as the basis for generating random bits. The resulting random numbers are subjected to a series of statistical tests for randomness, including the NIST test suite. Our findings indicate that the method produces statistically sound random numbers. However, the rate of bit generation is relatively low, limiting its practicality for real-time TRNG applications under the current configuration. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that time series modeling presents a promising framework for extracting randomness from the DECAL sensor, and that with further optimization, the sensor could serve as a reliable and effective TRNG.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based RoCEv2-RDMA Readout Electronics for the CTAO-LST Advanced Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CTAO's (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) largest telescopes type, the LST (Large-Sized Telescope), are being installed at the northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. Their aim is to capture the lowest-energy gamma rays of the observatory. The hereby proposed readout electronics architecture, serving as a proof-of-concept for its advanced camera upgrade, relies on a custom high-channel count fast sampling hardware digitizer board acting as a Front-End. The design includes a versatile pre-amplification stage and high-speed serial links for streaming JESD204C-compliant data at rates approaching 12 Gb/s per lane. The data get transferred to Back-End electronics for a first data-processing and trigger before being transmitted to event-building servers through 10 Gb/s Ethernet links. The performance of the link is exploited by implementing RDMA communication in hardware, thanks to a RoCEv2 core written in Bluespec SystemVerilog, enabling the possibility of transfer data directly to processing units without CPU intervention. Hardware design and characterization of the Front End board are reported, as well as a detailed description and tests of the Back End RDMA firmware.</description>

      <title>The Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for PRIMA: Approach and Estimated Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the architectural concept for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for the Probe Mission for far-IR Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS spans the 24--235 micron range with four R ~ 100 slit-fed grating modules, each coupling to a 24 (spatial) by 84 (spectral) pixel array of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). All four arrays are read out simultaneously, and a point source of interest can be coupled to two of the four bands at a time. A Fourier transform module can be engaged over a portion of the FIRESS slits to create a high-resolution mode in which the light is intercepted, processed by the interferometer then reinserted into the path to the grating modules for detection. We provide a simulation and description of the technique that will be used to obtain high-resolution spectra. We identify the most important system requirements imposed by the detector system, finding that they are met with the existing design. Finally, we present our performance modeling, including both direct estimates given our current design status, as well as durable guidelines for developing general-observer programs.</description>

      <title>Timing performance of SiPM-on-Tile elements: Laboratory and test beam measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SiPM-on-Tile technology for highly granular calorimeters, where small plastic scintillator tiles are directly read out with SiPMs, has been developed for the CALICE Analog Hadron Calorimeter, and has been adopted for parts of the hadronic section of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. For future electron-positron colliders, a single cell time stamping on the sub-nanosecond level for energy deposits corresponding to single minimum-ionizing particles is desired to provide background rejection and to support pattern recognition and energy reconstruction with particle flow algorithms. To better understand the time resolution achievable with the SiPM-on-Tile technology, we have performed detailed measurements in test beams at DESY, probing scintillator tiles of different sizes. The study is complemented by laser measurements that provide insights into processes within the scintillator tile relevant for timing. In this publication, we will discuss our measurement methods and the results of our SiPM-on-Tile timing study.</description>

      <title>Towards AMS measurements of $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo produced in fusion environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-lived radionuclides, such as $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo, are expected to be produced in nuclear fusion reactors by reactions of high-energy neutrons with the structural material. Accurate predictions of waste categorization require experimental validation of simulation codes like FISPACT-II. This work explores the use of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) to measure these three radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The ILIAMS setup employs laser photodetachment to suppress their respective stable isobars: $^{91}$Zr, $^{94}$Zr and $^{94}$Mo, and $^{93}$Nb. For $^{91,94}$Nb measurements, NbO$_3^-$ is selected, with interferences from ZrO$_3^-$ suppressed by collisions with the He buffer gas in the ion cooler. The suppression can be enhanced by overlapping a 355\,nm laser with the ion beam. The lower limit for the suppression factor is 37000. In that way, we reach $^{91}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb and $^{94}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb levels of $1.2\,\times\,10^{-14}$ and $1.8\,\times\,10^{-14}$, respectively, in targets prepared from commercial Nb$_2$O$_5$. MoO$_3$ is suppressed by a factor of 4360, leading to a $^{94}$Mo/$^{93}$Nb interference of $1.28\,\times\,10^{-10}$ in the same targets. For $^{93}$Mo measurements, MoO$_2^-$ is selected, with interference from $^{93}$NbO$_2^-$ suppressed by 637\,nm photons by a factor of $5.5\,\times\,10^6$. This results in a $^{93}$Nb/$^\text{nat}$Mo level of $1.3\,\times\,10^{-13}$ in targets prepared from commercial MoO$_3$. Suppression factors as high as this are not achieved by isobar suppression techniques based on differences in energy loss, not even by AMS facilities with terminal voltages above 8.5\,MV.</description>

      <title>LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12655v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.</description>

Abstract: SARA is the system of plastic scintillators coupled with silicon photomultipliers that will take part in the AEgIS experiment at CERN, measuring the time-of-flight of antihydrogen as it falls through a moir\'e deflectometer. Its development focused on simplicity, versatility and economy of the design and was supported by both physical tests and finite elements numerical simulations. The instrument's structure pairs the utilization of the scintillators as structural components with custom made 3D printed corner elements and the electronics allows selection between coincidence discrimination made on each scintillator and made between different scintillators.</description>

      <title>Design of high-strength, radiopure copper-chromium alloys for rare-event searches assisted by computational thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Dark Matter detection and studies on the nature of neutrinos demand detector systems with extremely low background levels, including from radioactivity. Additive-free, electroformed copper, in addition to a set of advantages, exhibits exceptional radiopurity, making it the material of choice for rare-event searches. To satisfy the increasing demand for materials with superior mechanical strength, the development of copper-chromium alloys is pursued. Early investigations explored the synthesis of these alloys by electrodeposition and thermal processing. A materials-design approach is proposed to optimize the fabrication and thermal processing stages of manufacturing. It is assisted by materials modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of alloy compositions, which enables faster development of novel materials by predicting properties and materials performance. This approach is demonstrated by comparing simulations with previously reported experimental investigations and proposing improved thermal processing.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Underground Muon Imaging at an Archaeological Site in Ancient Jerusalem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel underground imaging system that utilizes cosmic-ray muons to explore the subsurface environment at the City of David archaeological site in ancient Jerusalem. This report details the initial findings from measurements conducted at a large cistern, commonly called "Jeremiah's cistern" (referenced in Jeremiah 38:6). The system aims to locate and map hidden voids and structural anomalies within the overburden. Our primary outcome is the derivation of the angular ground depth, which serves as a proxy for understanding the integrated density distribution of the overburden. This work represents a significant interdisciplinary effort to deepen our understanding of this historically important site.</description>
