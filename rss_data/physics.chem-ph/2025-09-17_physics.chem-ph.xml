      <title>Exact mid-IR quantum vibrational spectra of neutral water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use selected configuration interaction to calculate the zero-temperature mid-infrared (2800-3800 cm$^{-1}$) vibrational spectra of a water monomer, dimer, trimer, and hexamer in its cage and prism geometries. We use the recently introduced, accurate q-AQUA-pol potential energy surface along with the n-mode representation of the potential to facilitate grid-based quadrature and integral storage. Within selected configuration interaction, we introduce a new approach to the calculation of spectra that is complementary to eigenstate enumeration. In the new approach, we calculate the spectrum using the response-vector method, and the system of linear equations is solved using a basis of configurations that are optimally selected at each frequency of interest. We compare our spectra to previous studies, and highlight limitations of the local monomer approximation. To the best of our knowledge, our hexamer spectra are the most accurate ones reported to date.</description>

      <title>Evolution of surfactant-free 'pristine' emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term pristine interface was introduced by Beattie and Djerdjev 20 years ago for emulsions that consist of only water and oil with no surfactant. They are different from Pickering emulsions, which are also surfactant-free but stabilized with colloidal particles. In contrast to previous studies, we monitor the kinetics of the initial stages of emulsion formation. We conducted such tests in an open setup when samples are open to air and CO2 content in the water varies, and in closed setup when samples are isolated with fixed CO2 content. For the open setup, sonication and initial pH &gt; 9 leads to emulsions with high zeta potential and sub-micron droplet size. There are two evolution patterns: short- and long-terms. The short term lasts about 1 day and has changing pH and zeta potential, but almost constant droplet size. The long term is is over several days or even weeks, with droplet size increase toward saturation value (rate dependent on mixing conditions), with pH and zeta potential remaining constant. Emulsification at the closed setup is much less pronounced and pH remains constant. This difference points to the importance of adsorbed CO2 and related carbonate ions in the formation of pristine emulsions and charging droplets interfaces. We hypothesize the existence of structured water molecule layer at the interface, following Eastoe and Ellis. The Electric Double Layer exerts a (dielectrostatic) force on the water dipole moments in this layer that compensates the Kelvins pressure. The droplet size from this model is close to our measurements. Also, there is a repulsion of the water dipole moments, which compensates for the surface tension parallel to the interface. After ruling out alternative hypotheses with our data, we conclude that the model suggested for explaining the stability of nano-bubbles is also consistent with our results for these pristine emulsions.</description>

      <title>Ion-modulated structure, proton transfer, and capacitance in the Pt(111)/water electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric double layer (EDL) governs electrocatalysis, energy conversion, and storage, yet its atomic structure, capacitance, and reactivity remain elusive. Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.</description>

      <title>A Reusable Library for Second-Order Orbital Optimization Using the Trust Region Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reusable, open-source software implementation of the second-order trust region algorithm in the new OpenTrustRegion library. We apply the implementation to the general-purpose optimization of molecular orbitals in various contexts within electronic-structure theory. Our permissibly licensed implementation can be included in any software package, be it free and open-source, academically licensed closed-source, or commercial. Detailing the implementation in OpenTrustRegion, we present a review of the theory behind trust region-based methods alongside various extensions. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our optimization library with extensive benchmarks for self-consistent field calculations, orbital localization, as well as orbital symmetrization tasks, featuring challenging and pathological systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling Carbon Coated Silicon Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries and the Influence of Contact Area on Rate Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its exceptionally high specific capacity (3600 mAh g$^{-1}$), significantly exceeding that of conventional graphite. However, its practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion (300-400%) during lithiation, leading to mechanical degradation and capacity fade. A graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C, especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes. The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and efficient Si-based composite anodes.</description>

      <title>Using molecular dynamics to investigate the driving force for graphene auto-kirigami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments [1] have shown that auto-kirigami structures can grow on the surface of graphene because the graphene-graphene adhesion energy is greater than the graphene-substrate interaction. In this work molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of folded graphene both in vacuum and on a substrate have been performed for a range of different initial geometries and at various temperatures. The final equilibrated configuration for many of these simulations resembles a book with a fold that is at the midpoint of the graphene sheet. We investigate the amount of time it takes to move from an initial folded configuration that does not have the fold at the midpoint of the graphene to this final, book-like configuration. We show that graphene-graphene and graphene substrate-adhesion energies can be extracted from such simulations and that the values obtained are almost always higher than the values of these quantities that are obtained from static calculations. We also show that the rate at which these folded structures grow is affected by differences in these adhesion energies. However, this rate is also affected by factors such as the initial geometry of the graphene that do not change the adhesion energies. Understanding the kinetics of auto-kirigami formation thus requires a description of the system that is more sophisticated than an energy-balance model.</description>

      <title>Reaction dynamics of lithium-mediated electrolyte decomposition using machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ring-opening decomposition of ethylene carbonate in the presence of a single lithium atom and on the surface of lithium metal. Combining accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning, we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and bent by about 70$^\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$ and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Body-Order Paradox of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many cases, the predictions of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be interpreted as a sum of body-ordered contributions, which is explicit when the model is directly built on neighbor density correlation descriptors, and implicit when the model captures the correlations through non-linear functions of low body-order terms. In both cases, the "effective body-orderedness" of MLIPs remains largely unexplained: how do the models decompose the total energy into body-ordered contributions, and how does their body-orderedness affect the accuracy and learning behavior? In answering these questions, we first discuss the complexities in imposing the many-body expansion on ab initio calculations at the atomic limit. Next, we train a curated set of MLIPs on datasets of hydrogen clusters and reveal the inherent tendency of the ML models to deduce their own, effective body-order trends, which are dependent on the model type and dataset makeup. Finally, we present different trends in the convergence of the body-orders and generalizability of the models, providing useful insights for the development of future MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Frozen Natural Orbitals based Equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles, doubles and triples for Ionized, Double-Ionized, Electron Attached and Two-Electron Attached states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present frozen natural orbital (FNO) based implementations of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) with singles, doubles, and triples (SDT) for ionization potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP), electron attachment (EA), and double electron attachment (DEA) variants. For EOM-CC with singles and doubles (SD), the FNO approach has already been studied by Krylov and co-workers for IP variant and for spin-flipping and spin-conserving excited states (respectively, the SF and EE variants) for both total energies and energy-gaps. Recently, we presented FNO-CCSDT performance for ground state energies of molecules, triplet-singlet gaps and for numerical estimation force constants of some diatomic molecules. Now we present our study on performance of IP, DIP, EA and DEA variants of FNO-EOM-CCSDT in computing total-energies, and for target-reference and target-target energy-gaps. Following earlier studies by us and by Krylov and co-workers, we also present the XFNO-EOM-CCSDT approach for these variants and examine its performance for total energies and energy-gaps.</description>

      <title>Teachers that teach the irrelevant: Pre-training machine learned interaction potentials with classical force fields for robust molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interaction potentials (MLIPs) have become a critical component of large-scale, high-quality simulations for a range of chemical and biochemical systems. Yet, despite their in-distribution accuracy, molecular dynamics simulations using MLIPs exhibit numerical instabilities due to underlying data insufficiencies when encountering new regions of the potential energy surface. Here we propose a pre-training learning scheme that uses low-quality, practically free, single-molecule non-reactive force field data while all intermolecular interactions and reactive properties are learned at a fine-tuning stage with a small amount of computationally more expensive labels. We show that the force field pre-training approach followed by data efficient ab initio fine tuning allows for stable and accurate molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations of gas phase molecules, liquid water, and hydrogen combustion reactions compared to models trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Linear Models for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemists in search of structure-property relationships face great challenges due to limited high quality, concordant datasets. Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced predictive capabilities in chemical sciences, but these modern data-driven approaches have increased the demand for data. In response to the growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) and to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and human comprehensibility, we introduce LAMeL - a Linear Algorithm for Meta-Learning that preserves interpretability while improving the prediction accuracy across multiple properties. While most approaches treat each chemical prediction task in isolation, LAMeL leverages a meta-learning framework to identify shared model parameters across related tasks, even if those tasks do not share data, allowing it to learn a common functional manifold that serves as a more informed starting point for new unseen tasks. Our method delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.1- to 25-fold over standard ridge regression, depending on the domain of the dataset. While the degree of performance enhancement varies across tasks, LAMeL consistently outperforms or matches traditional linear methods, making it a reliable tool for chemical property prediction where both accuracy and interpretability are critical.</description>

      <title>Thermal Degradation Mechanisms and Stability Enhancement Strategies in Perovskite Solar Cells: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have garnered global research interest owing to their superior photovoltaic (PV) performance. The future of photovoltaic technology lies in PSCs since they can produce power with performance on par with the best silicon solar cells while being less expensive. PSCs have enormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to 25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability is PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and lightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that hole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers, especially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into PbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and environmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher thermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress. HTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant additions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and inorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved thermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and interface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC. Addressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient PSC technology.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Limits of MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$: Revisiting High-Order Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150 000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3 500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>
