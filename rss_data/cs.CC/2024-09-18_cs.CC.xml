      <title>The Complexity of Maximizing the MST-ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of red and blue points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the MST-ratio is the combined length of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees of red points and of blue points divided by the length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of the union of them. The maximum MST-ratio of a point set is the maximum MST-ratio over all non-trivial colorings of its points by red and blue. We prove that the problem of finding the maximum MST-ratio of a given point set is NP-hard when the dimension is a part of the input. Moreover, we present a $O(n^2)$ running time $3$-approximation algorithm for it. As a part of the proof, we show that in any metric space, the maximum MST-ratio is smaller than $3$. Additionally, we study the average MST-ratio over all colorings of a set of $n$ points. We show that this average is always at least $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and for $n$ random points uniformly distributed in a $d$-dimensional unit cube, the average tends to $\sqrt[d]{2}$ in expectation as $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite programming and linear equations vs. homomorphism problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation for homomorphism problems that combines semidefinite programming with linear Diophantine equations, and propose a framework for the analysis of its power based on the spectral theory of association schemes. We use this framework to establish an unconditional lower bound against the semidefinite programming + linear equations model, by showing that the relaxation does not solve the approximate graph homomorphism problem and thus, in particular, the approximate graph colouring problem.</description>

      <title>On $NP$ versus ${\rm co}NP$ and Frege Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove in this paper that there is a language $L_d$ accepted by some nondeterministic Turing machines but not by any ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$-machines (defined later). Then we further show that $L_d$ is in $\mathcal{NP}$, thus proving that $\mathcal{NP}\neq{\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$. The techniques used in this paper are lazy-diagonalization and the novel new technique developed in author's recent work \cite{Lin21}. As a by-product, we reach the important result that $\mathcal{P}\neq\mathcal{NP}$ \cite{Lin21} once again, which is clear from the above outcome and the well-known fact that $\mathcal{P}={\rm co}\mathcal{P}$. Next, we show that the complexity class ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$ has intermediate languages, i.e., there are language $L_{inter}\in{\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$ which is not in $\mathcal{P}$ and not ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$-complete. We also summarize other direct consequences such as $\mathcal{NEXP}\neq{\rm co}\mathcal{NEXP}$ and other which is in the area of proof complexity implied by our main outcome. Lastly, we show a lower bounds result for Frege proof systems, i.e., no Frege proof systems can be polynomial bounded.</description>

      <title>The Tensor as an Informational Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers that can be used to store data, encode a computational relation and represent quantum entanglement. In this sense a tensor can be viewed as valuable resource whose transformation can lead to an understanding of structure in data, computational complexity and quantum information.
  In order to facilitate the understanding of this resource, we propose a family of information-theoretically constructed preorders on tensors, which can be used to compare tensors with each other and to assess the existence of transformations between them. The construction places copies of a given tensor at the edges of a hypergraph and allows transformations at the vertices. A preorder is then induced by the transformations possible in a given growing sequence of hypergraphs. The new family of preorders generalises the asymptotic restriction preorder which Strassen defined in order to study the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.
  We derive general properties of the preorders and their associated asymptotic notions of tensor rank and view recent results on tensor rank non-additivity, tensor networks and algebraic complexity in this unifying frame. We hope that this work will provide a useful vantage point for exploring tensors in applied mathematics, physics and computer science, but also from a purely mathematical point of view.</description>
