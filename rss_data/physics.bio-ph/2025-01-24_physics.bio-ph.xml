      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Impact of the RNA Binding Domain Localization of the Protein Shell on Virus Particle Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encapsulation of polyanions, whether single-stranded RNAs or synthetic polymers, is primarily driven by attractive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged, structurally disordered RNA-binding domains of virus coat proteins and the negatively charged polyanions. Theoretically, this interaction is often modeled by coarse-graining the charge distribution of the binding domains, either by projecting the charges onto the inner surface of the protein shell or by spreading them across a region representing the capsid lumen where the binding domains are located. In practice, however, the positive charges are not uniformly distributed across the binding domains, which themselves are positioned at discrete, specific sites on the shell surface. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of localized interactions on the most probable or optimal length of the encapsulated polymer, revealing that the specific location of charges along the binding domains plays a significant role, consistent with experimental observations. Comparing the simulations with predictions from a simple mean-field theory taken from the literature, we find that while the general trends are reasonably well captured, quantitative discrepancies arise between the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Mechanical Memory in a Random Fibrous Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered fibrous matrices, formed by the random assembly of fibers, provide the structural framework for many biological systems and biomaterials. Applied deformation modifies the alignment and stress states of constituent fibers, tuning the nonlinear elastic response of these materials. While it is generally presumed that fibers return to their original configurations after deformation is released, except when neighboring fibers coalesce or individual fibers yield, this reversal process remains largely unexplored. The intricate geometry of these matrices leaves an incomplete understanding of whether releasing deformation fully restores the matrix or introduces new microstructural deformation mechanisms. To address this gap, we investigated the evolution of matrix microstructures during the release of an applied deformation. Numerical simulations were performed on quasi-two-dimensional matrices of random fibers under localized tension, with fibers modeled as beams in finite element analysis. After tension release, the matrix exhibited permanent mechanical remodeling, with greater remodeling occurring at higher magnitudes of applied tension, indicative of the matrix preserving its loading history as mechanical memory. This response was surprising; it occurred despite the absence of explicit plasticity mechanisms, such as activation of inter-fiber cohesion or fiber yielding. We attributed the observed remodeling to the gradient in fiber alignment that developed within the matrix microstructure under applied tension, driving the subsequent changes in matrix properties during the release of applied tension. Therefore, random fibrous matrices tend to retain mechanical memory due to their intricate geometry.</description>

      <title>Reaction kinetics of membrane receptors: a spatial modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between diffusing molecules and membrane-bound receptors drive numerous cellular processes. In this work, we develop a spatial model of molecular interactions with membrane receptors by homogenizing the cell membrane and describing the evolution of both molecular diffusion and molecule-receptor interactions. By analyzing a resulting partial differential equation coupled to ordinary differential equations, we derive analytical expressions for the steady-state molecular influx rate in four prototypical interaction scenarios: Michaelis-Menten kinetics, Substrate Competition, Competitive Inhibition, and Uncompetitive Inhibition. For each scenario, we show how to modify the classical well-mixed reaction rate theory to resolve spatial features inherent to receptors bound to cell membranes. We find that naive well-mixed calculations significantly overestimate reaction rates in certain biophysical parameter regimes.</description>
