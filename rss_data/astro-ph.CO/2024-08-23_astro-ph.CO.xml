      <title>Average energy of the X-ray spectrum as a model-independent proxy for the mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature of the hot gas in galaxy clusters is known to be a reliable proxy for the their total gravitating mass, allowing one to use spectroscopic X-ray observations for halo mass function measurements. Data of shallow wide area surveys, however, often precludes direct fitting of the X-ray spectra, given possible biases arising due to unresolved (multitemperature) inner structure of the intracluster medium (ICM), projection effects and necessity of certain model assumptions to be made to allow for robust spectral fitting. We consider using a simple observable value - the average energy of the observed cluster X-ray spectrum - as a model-independent proxy for the ICM temperature, and consequently cluster's mass. We calibrate relation of this proxy to the cluster parameters using mock obsesrvations for a sample of 84 massive galaxy clusters extracted from the Magneticum cosmological hydro simulations. We consider observational parameters corresponding to the all-sky survey observations by SRG/eROSITA. Taking into account contributions of various background and foreground signals, average energy of the simulated X-ray spectra in the $0.4-7.0$ keV band is shown to be a stable indicator of the ICM temperature with $\sim10\%$ scatter and cluster's mass $M_{500}$ with a $\sim 20\%$ scatter. A database containing simulated X-ray images and their spectra (subtracted in several concentric rings) is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations with ultralight vector dark matter fields: numerical implementation in CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a dark matter candidate described by an ultralight vector field, whose mass is in principle in the range $H_{\rm{eq}}\sim 10^{-28}\rm{eV}\ll m&lt; \rm{eV}$. The homogeneous background vector field is assumed to point in a given direction. We present a numerical implementation of cosmological perturbations in a Bianchi type I geometry with vector field dark matter in a modified version of the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS). We study the evolution of large-scale cosmological perturbations in the linear regime. We compute the matter power spectrums defined for Fourier modes pointing in a given direction. We obtain interesting features in the power spectrums whose observational significance depends on the field mass. We compare the results with the standard $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ and with the corresponding well-studied ultralight scalar field dark matter case. As for the scalar case we obtain a suppression in the power spectrums at small scales characterized by the same scale, namely the Jeans scale. The main characteristic feature of the vector field model we notice here for first time is that the amplitude of the suppression effect depends on the direction of the Fourier modes with respect to the background vector field, leaving eventually a possible anisotropic imprint in structure formation at small scales.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <title>Quantifying $S_8$ tension and evidence for interacting dark energy from redshift-space distortion measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, Weak Lensing surveys, and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ measurements from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) have revealed a significant ($\sim$3$-$5$\sigma$) discrepancy in the inferred value of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. In this work, we investigate the implications of RSD for a cosmological framework postulating an interaction between Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM). We explore scenarios where DM can transfer energy-momentum to DE or vice versa. The energy-momentum flow is characterized by the strength and the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. Our baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with the latest data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observed by DESI, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus sample, and CMB data from Planck. We demonstrate that RSD measurements provide significant additional information. When energy-momentum flows from DM to DE (i.e., $\xi &lt; 0$), these measurements set stringent new bounds on the interaction strength. Conversely, when energy-momentum flows from DE to DM ($\xi &gt; 0$), they favor interactions at more than the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Models with $\xi &gt; 0$ can effectively resolve the tension in $S_8$, presenting them as compelling alternatives.</description>

      <title>Do we need wavelets in the late Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parameterize the Hubble function by adding Hermitian wavelets to the Hubble radius of $\Lambda$CDM. This allows us to build Hubble functions that oscillate around $\Lambda$CDM at late times without modifying its angular diameter distance to last scattering. We perform parameter inference and model selection procedures on these new Hubble functions at the background level. In our analyses consisting of a wide variety of cosmological observations, we find that baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data play a crucial role in determining the constraints on the wavelet parameters. In particular, we focus on the differences between SDSS- and DESI-BAO datasets and find that wavelets provide a better fit to the data when either of the BAO datasets is present. However, DESI-BAO has a preference for the center of the wavelets to be around $z \sim 0.7$, while SDSS-BAO prefers higher redshifts of $z &gt; 1$. This difference appears to be driven by the discrepancies between these two datasets in their $D_H / r_{\rm d}$ measurements at $z = 0.51$ and $z \sim 2.3$. Finally, we also derive the consequences of the wavelets on a dark energy component. We find that the dark energy density oscillates by construction and also attains negative values at large redshifts ($z\gtrsim2$) as a consequence of the SDSS-BAO data. We conclude that while the early universe and the constraints on the matter density and the Hubble constant remain unchanged, wavelets are favored in the late universe by the BAO data. Specifically, there is a significant improvement at more than $3\sigma$ in the fit when new DESI-BAO data are included in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Inflaton Potential: Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in Slow Roll and Ultra Slow Roll Single Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new single field inflationary scenarios that produce the critical abundance of primordial black holes as dark matter reconstructing the inflaton potential from an input power spectrum. The method is exact in the slow roll approximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are temporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we construct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM abundance within the slow roll regime. As a second application we consider a scalar power spectrum that generates a secondary gravitational wave background compatible with the one recently observed in Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. These scenarios could be tested by future observations of $\mu-$distortions of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Parametrized-Post-Newtonian Test of Black Hole Spacetime for Galactic Center Massive Black Hole Sgr A*: Formulation and $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) test of a black hole spacetime using observational data of the star S0-2/S2 orbiting the massive black hole at our galactic center Sgr A*. After introducing our PPN model of black hole spacetime, we report the result of $\chi^2$ fitting of the PPN model with the observational data. A new finding through our PPN model is a detectability of the gravitational lens effect on the null geodesics connecting S0-2 and observer under the present observational uncertainties, if a PPN parameter is about one order larger than the value for general relativity case. On the other hand, the effect of black hole spin on the S0-2's motion is not detectable. Thus our present PPN test is performed with spherically symmetric vacuum black hole spacetime. The resultant value of the PPN parameter, which corresponds to the minimum $\chi^2$, implies that the gravitational field of Sgr A* is not of Schwarzschild metric or that the existence of sufficient amount of dark matters around Sgr A*. However, the difference between the minimum $\chi^2$ and the $\chi^2$ of Schwarzschild case is not large enough to ensure a statistical significance of non-Schwarzschild result. A more precise statistical analysis than $\chi^2$ statistics is necessary to extract a statistically significant information of the gravitational field of Sgr A* from present observational data. We will report a result by a Bayesian analysis in next paper.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Superheavy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational production of superheavy scalar fields with nonminimal coupling during and after inflation. We derive analytical approximations using the mode function solution in a de Sitter background and also apply the steepest descent method. We study both positive and negative nonminimal couplings and show that their comoving number density spectra behave differently in the short and long wavelength regimes. We numerically compute the comoving number density spectra and dark matter abundance for a broad range of superheavy spectator fields exceeding the Hubble scale during inflation, with $m_{\chi} &gt; H_I$, and nonminimal couplings ranging from $-300 \leq \xi \leq 300$. When computing the allowed dark matter parameter space, we impose the maximum reheating temperature constraint, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraint, and the isocurvature constraint. We show that the presence of a positive or negative coupling $\xi$ can expand the parameter space up to $3$ orders of magnitude above the Hubble inflationary scale, allowing such dark matter candidates to be as heavy as $\sim 10^{16} \, \rm{GeV}$ in the Starobinsky model of inflation.</description>

      <title>Sizes and Stellar Masses of the Little Red Dots Imply Immense Stellar Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are red and compact galaxies detected in JWST deep fields, mainly in the redshift range $z=4-8$. Given their compactness and the inferred stellar masses in the hypothesis that LRDs are starburst galaxies, the implied stellar densities are immense. This Research Note uses an extensive catalog of LRDs from the PRIMER and the COSMOS-Web surveys to investigate these densities. We find a median (upper limit) on the effective radius of $80$ pc, which leads to median (lower limit) values of the core density of $\sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, and individual densities as high as $\sim 10^8 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, which is $\sim 10$ times higher than the density necessary for runaway collisions to take place. For $\sim 35\%$ of the LRDs investigated, the lower limits are higher than the highest stellar densities observed in any system in any redshift range.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Merger Rate with Modified Gravity in Dark-Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark-matter spikes surrounding super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions, Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH-PBH and PBH-NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark-matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO-Virgo observations to constrain the parameters of the theory. In particular we find steeper dark-matter spike density profiles in the modified gravity scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models are found to be wider than by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results on the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties in making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result on PBH properties.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the growth index parameters in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyse constraints on the growth index of matter perturbations, $\gamma$, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, using recent cosmological observations, at the background and the perturbation levels, including Pantheon$^{+}$, Cosmic Chronometer (CC), and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) datasets. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the distortion parameter, which measures the deviation of the $f(Q)$ gravity model from the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at the background level. Specifically, we investigate two cases of the growth index parameter: a constant $\gamma$ and a time-varying $\gamma(z)$. We investigate various parametrizations of the growth index $\gamma$, expressed as $\gamma = \gamma_{0} +\gamma_{1} y(z)$, where the function $y(z)$ assumes different forms, including constant ($\Gamma_{0}$), Taylor expansion around $z = 0$ ($\Gamma_{1}$), Taylor expansion around the scale factor ($\Gamma_{2}$), and an exponential form ($\Gamma_{3}$). By employing the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion, we find that the combined Pantheon$^{+}$+ CC+ RSD datasets impose stringent constraints on the value of the growth index. For the $\Gamma_{0}$ model, our results indicate that within the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, $\gamma$ is constrained to $0.545 \pm 0.096$, showing strong agreement with the theoretical expectation of $\gamma_{\Lambda} = \frac{6}{11}$. However, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, we observe $\gamma = 0.571^{+0.095}_{-0.110}$, slightly exceeding the $\Lambda$CDM value by 4.66 $\%$. Furthermore, when considering a time-varying growth index, our analysis reveals that the range of $\gamma_{0}$ spans from $0.596$ to $0.62$ across the $\Gamma_{1-3}$ models.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Imprints of dark matter on the structural properties of minimally deformed compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the possibility of constructing anisotropic dark matter compact stars motivated by the Einasto density profile. This work develops analytical solutions for an anisotropic fluid sphere within the framework of the well-known Adler-Finch-Skea metric. This toy model incorporates an anisotropic fluid distribution that includes a dark matter component. We use the minimal geometric deformation scheme within the framework of gravitational decoupling to incorporate anisotropy into the pressure profile of the stellar system. In this context, we model the temporal constituent of the $\Theta$-field sector to characterize the contribution of dark matter within the gravitational matter source. We present an alternative approach to studying anisotropic self-gravitating structures. This approach incorporates additional field sources arising from gravitational decoupling, which act as the dark component. We explicitly verify whether the proposed model satisfies all the requirements for describing realistic compact structures in detail. We conclude that the modeling of the Einasto density model with the Adler-Finch-Skea metric gives rise to the formation of well-behaved and viable astrophysical results that can be employed to model the dark matter stellar configurations.</description>

      <title>From Halos to Galaxies. VI. Improved halo mass estimation for SDSS groups and measurement of the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo-galaxy connection. The abundance matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar mass of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties in the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve, we developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\sim1/3$ more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities from simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS Yang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to $10^{11.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with those obtained from direct weak lensing measurements. These new halo mass estimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy-halo connection and the role of the halos in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal and non-thermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Can the angular scale of cosmic homogeneity be used as a cosmological test?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard cosmology, the cosmic homogeneity scale is the transition scale above which the patterns arising from non-uniformities -- such as groups and clusters of galaxies, voids, and filaments -- become indistinguishable from a random distribution of sources. Recently, different groups have investigated the feasibility of using such a scale as a cosmological test and arrived at different conclusions. In this paper, we complement and extend these studies by exploring the evolution of the spatial (${\cal{R}}_H$) and angular ($\theta_H$) homogeneity scales with redshift, assuming a spatially flat, $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter %($\Lambda$CDM) universe and linear cosmological perturbation theory. We confirm previous results concerning the non-monotonicity of ${\cal{R}}_H$ with the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ but also show that it exhibits a monotonical behavior with the Hubble constant $H_0$ within a large redshift interval. More importantly, we find that, for $z \gtrsim 0.6$, the angular homogeneity scale not only presents a monotonical behavior with $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ but is quite sensitive to $H_0$, especially at higher redshifts. These results, therefore, raise the possibility of using $\theta_H$ as a new, model-independent way to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Temperature-Density Relation in the Low-Density Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the evolution of the phase diagram of the low-density intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization in simulation boxes with varying reionization histories from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers project. The PDF of gas temperature at fixed density exhibits two clear modes: a warm and cold temperature mode, corresponding to the gas inside and outside of ionized bubbles. We find that the transition between the two modes is "universal" in the sense that its timing is accurately parameterized by the value of the volume-weighted neutral fraction for any reionization history. This "universality" is more complex than just a reflection of the fact that ionized gas is warm and neutral gas is cold: it holds for the transition at a fixed value of gas density, and gas at different densities transitions from the cold to the warm mode at different values of the neutral fraction, reflecting a non-trivial relationship between the ionization history and the evolving gas density PDF. Furthermore, the "emergence" of the tight temperature-density relation in the warm mode is also approximately "universally" controlled by the volume-weighted neutral fraction for any reionization history. In particular, the "emergence" of the temperature-density relation (as quantified by the rapid decrease in its width) occurs when the neutral fraction is $10^{-4}\lesssim X_\mathrm{HI} \lesssim10^{-3}$ for any reionization history. Our results indicate that the neutral fraction is a primary quantity controlling the various properties of the temperature-density relation, regardless of reionization history.</description>

      <title>CMB lensing power spectrum without noise bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys will measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) weak lensing power spectrum in exquisite detail, allowing for strong constraints on the sum of neutrino masses among other cosmological parameters. Standard CMB lensing power spectrum estimators aim to extract the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum of CMB temperature maps. However, they are generically dominated by a large Gaussian noise bias, which thus needs to be subtracted at high accuracy. This is currently done with realistic map simulations of the CMB and noise, whose finite accuracy currently limits our ability to recover CMB lensing on small-scales. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator which instead avoids this large Gaussian bias. This estimator relies only on the data and avoids the need for bias subtraction with simulations. Thus our bias avoidance method is (1) insensitive to misestimates in simulated CMB and noise models and (2) avoids the large computational cost of standard simulation-based methods like "realization-dependent $N^{(0)}$" (${\rm RDN}^{(0)}$). We show that our estimator is as robust as standard methods in the presence of realistic inhomogeneous noise (e.g. from scan strategy) and masking. Moreover, our method can be combined with split-based methods, making it completely insensitive to mode coupling from inhomogeneous atmospheric and detector noise. We derive the corresponding expressions for our estimator when estimating lensing from CMB temperature and polarization. Although we specifically consider CMB weak lensing power spectrum estimation in this paper, we illuminate the relation between our new estimator, ${\rm RDN}^{(0)}$ subtraction, and general optimal trispectrum estimation. Through this discussion we conclude that our estimator is applicable to analogous problems in other fields which rely on estimating connected trispectra/four-point functions like large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <title>Percolation Statistics in the MillenniumTNG Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistical analysis of cosmic large-scale structure is most often based on simple two-point summary statistics, like the power spectrum or the two-point correlation function of a sample of galaxies or other types of tracers. In contrast, topological measures of clustering are also sensitive to higher-order correlations, and thus offer the prospect to access additional information that may harbor important constraining power. We here revisit one such geometric measure of the cosmic web in the form of the so-called percolation analysis, using the recent MillenniumTNG simulation suite of the LCDM paradigm. We analyze continuum percolation statistics both for high resolution dark matter particle distributions, as well as for galaxy mock catalogues from a semi-analytic galaxy formation model within a periodic simulation volume of 3000 Mpc on a side. For comparison, we also investigate the percolation statistics of random particle sets and neutrino distributions with two different summed particle masses. We find that the percolation statistics of the dark matter distribution evolves strongly with redshift and thus clustering strength, yielding progressively lower percolation threshold towards later times. However, there is a sizable residual dependence on numerical resolution which we interpret as a residual influence of different levels of shot noise. This is corroborated by our analysis of galaxy mock catalogues whose results depend on sampling density more strongly than on galaxy selection criteria. While this limits the discriminative power of percolation statistics, our results suggest that it still remains useful as a complementary cosmological test when controlled for sampling density.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial and velocity anisotropies in stellar halos from the Aquarius simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spatial anisotropy and the velocity anisotropy in a set of mock stellar halos from the Aquarius simulations. The spatial anisotropy in each mock stellar halo rises progressively with the increasing distance from the halo centre, eventually reaching a maximum near the periphery. Excluding the bound satellites leads to a significant reduction of the spatial anisotropy in each halo. We compare the measured anisotropy in the mock stellar halos with that from their sphericalized versions where all the shape and substructure induced anisotropies are erased. The growth of spatial anisotropy persists throughout the entire halo when the bound satellites are present but remains limited within the inner halo ($&lt;60 \, h^{-1}\, {\rm kpc}$) after their exclusion. This indicates that the spatial anisotropy in the inner halo is induced by the diffuse substructures and the halo shape whereas the outer halo anisotropy is dominated by the bound satellites. We find that the outer parts of the stellar halo are kinematically colder than the inner regions. The stellar orbits are predominantly radial but they become rotationally dominated at certain radii that are marked by the prominent dips in the velocity anisotropy. Most of these dips disappear after the removal of the satellites. A few shallow dips arise occasionally due to the presence of diffuse streams and clouds. Our analysis suggests that a combined study of the spatial and velocity anisotropies can reveal the structure and the assembly history of the stellar halos.</description>

      <title>Axion minicluster streams in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consequence of QCD axion dark matter being born after inflation is the emergence of small-scale substructures known as miniclusters. Although miniclusters merge to form minihalos, this intrinsic granularity is expected to remain imprinted on small scales in our galaxy, leading to potentially damaging consequences for the campaign to detect axions directly on Earth. This picture, however, is modified when one takes into account the fact that encounters with stars will tidally strip mass from the miniclusters, creating pc-long tidal streams that act to refill the dark matter distribution. Here we ask whether or not this stripping rescues experimental prospects from the worst-case scenario in which the majority of axions remain bound up in unobservably small miniclusters. We find that the density sampled by terrestrial experiment on mpc-scales will be, on average, around 70--90\% of the average local DM density, and at a typical point in the solar neighbourhood, we expect most of the dark matter to be comprised of debris from $\mathcal{O}(10^2$--$10^3)$ overlapping streams. If haloscopes can measure the axion signal with high-enough frequency resolution, then these streams are revealed in the form of an intrinsically spiky lineshape, in stark contrast with the standard assumption of a smooth, featureless Maxwellian distribution -- a unique prediction that constitutes a way for experiments to distinguish between pre and post-inflationary axion cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Subhalos in Galaxy Clusters: Coherent Accretion and Internal Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subhalo dynamics in galaxy cluster host halos govern the observed distribution and properties of cluster member galaxies. We use the IllustrisTNG simulation to investigate the accretion and orbits of subhalos found in cluster-size halos. We find that the median change in the major axis direction of cluster-size host halos is approximately $80$ degrees between $a\sim0.1$ and present-day. We identify coherent regions in the angular distribution of subhalo accretion, and $\sim68\%$ of accreted subhalos enter their host halo through $\sim38\%$ of the surface area at the virial radius. The majority of galaxy clusters in the sample have $\sim2$ such coherent regions. We further measure angular orbits of subhalos with respect to the host major axis and use a clustering algorithm to identify distinct orbit modes with varying oscillation timescales. The orbit modes correlate with subhalo accretion conditions. Subhalos in orbit modes with shorter oscillations tend to have lower peak masses and accretion directions somewhat more aligned with the major axis. One orbit mode, exhibiting the least oscillatory behavior, largely consists of subhalos that accrete near the plane perpendicular to the host halo major axis. Our findings are consistent with expectations from inflow from major filament structures and internal dynamical friction: most subhalos accrete through coherent regions, and more massive subhalos experience fewer orbits after accretion. Our work offers a unique quantification of subhalo dynamics that can be connected to how the intracluster medium strips and quenches cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>ARTEMIS emulator: exploring the effect of cosmology and galaxy formation physics on Milky Way-mass haloes and their satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the new ARTEMIS Emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes' stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>

We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than ~5x10^{-14} solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>
