      <title>Mesh-comparable components of the Auslander-Reiten quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of using Riedtmann's well-behaved functors to study compositions of irreducible morphisms has been explored in a number of articles. Here we introduce the concept of mesh-comparable components of the Auslander-Reiten quiver, which are components for which a Riedtmann functor exists without the necessity of taking a covering, such as the universal or the generic one. We show properties of this type of component, and study the problem of compositions of irreducible morphisms in this context.</description>

      <title>Permutation modules over cyclic $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a cyclic $p$-group for some prime number $p&gt;0$ and let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring in mixed characteristic. In this paper, we present a generalization of two results that characterize $RG$-permutation modules, extending previous work by B. Torrecillas and Th. Weigel. Their original results were established under the assumption that $ p$ is unramified in $R$, whereas we extend their characterization to the case where $p$ may be ramified. Unlike prior approaches, our proofs rely solely on fundamental facts from group cohomology and a version of Weiss' Theorem, avoiding deeper categorical techniques.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases for mesh relations and applications to compositions of irreducible morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a necessary condition for the existence of a path of n irreducible morphisms between indecomposable modules whose composition lies in the (n + 1)-power of the radical. In order to do that, we consider the general criterion given by C. Chaio, P. Le Meur and S. Trepode, which relates these compositions with zero paths in the mesh category, and then study morphisms in the mesh category by providing Gr\"obner bases for the subspaces generated by the mesh relations.</description>

      <title>Rationality properties of complex representations of reductive p-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reductive group G over a non-archimedean local field, we compare smooth representations over C with smooth representations over Qbar (an algebraic closure of Q). For example, we show that tensoring with C over Qbar preserves irreducibility of representations. We also show that an elliptic G-representation (in the sense of Arthur) can be realized over Qbar if and only if its central character takes values in Qbar. That applies in particular to all essentially square-integrable G-representations.
  We also study the action of the automorphism group of C/Q on complex G-representations. We prove that the classes of essentially square-integrable representations and of elliptic representations are stable under Aut(C/Q).</description>

      <title>A Note on primitive pairs for graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of primitive pairs for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras when the sheaves have coefficients in a field $\Bbbk$ of positive characteristic, providing a graded analogue of the role played by cuspidal pairs in the generalized Springer correspondence. We consider the centralizer $G_0$ of a fixed cocharacter $\chi$ in a connected, reductive, algebraic group $G$ and its action on the eigenspaces $\mathfrak{g}_n$ of $\chi$. Building on the framework of parity sheaves and the Fourier transform established in \cite{Ch,Ch1}, we show that every indecomposable parity sheaf on $\mathfrak{g}_n$ can be expressed as a direct summand of a complex induced from primitive data on a Levi subgroup. This result extends the fact that, in the graded setting, any indecomposable parity sheaf is direct summand of an induced cuspidal datum \cite{Ch}. This confirms the organizing role of primitive pairs in the block decomposition of the category of $G_0$-equivariant parity sheaves on $\mathfrak{g}_n$. We further establish that primitive pairs on the nilpotent cone induce primitive pairs in the graded setting, and we prove that primitivity is preserved under the Fourier--Sato transform. These results reveal a deep compatibility between the geometry of graded Lie algebras and their representation-theoretic structures, forming the foundation for a graded version of the generalized Springer correspondence in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>The high-dimension limit of characters of compact reductive Lie groups and restrictions on the production of quantum randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any element $g$ of compact reductive group $G$ we investigate the asymptotic behavior of its normalized irreducible character in the high-dimension limit, $\frac{\chi_\lambda(g)}{d_\lambda}$. We show that when $G$ is simple the limit vanishes besides identity element. For semisimple groups one gets the same results under the additional assumption that dimensions of irreducible representations of all simple components are going to infinity. Using the notion of approximate $t$-designs we connect this observations with bounds on the production of quantum randomness in large quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An extension of Viennot's shadow to rook placements via orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23735v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m,r$ with $r \leq \min(n,m)$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times m$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]$. We define a homogeneous ideal $I_{n,m,r}$, where the graded quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ carries an action of the group $\mathfrak{S}_n \times \mathfrak{S}_m$ by independent permutations of rows and columns. This quotient ring is obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all rook placements of size at least $r$. We show that the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ admits a standard monomial basis, which is determined by extending rook placements to an element in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence. We also determine the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$.</description>

      <title>Re-framing the classification of ideals in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given the Balmer spectrum of any essentially small monoidal-triangulated category, one has a classification of semiprime thick tensor ideals arising in terms of a "pseudo-Hochster-dual" of the noncommutative Balmer spectrum. This extends Balmer's classification of radical thick tensor ideals to noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry. To achieve this, we utilize the notion of support data for lattices and frames, under which the classification is a consequence of Stone duality. We also give a characterization for when the noncommutative Balmer spectrum behaves as it does in tensor-triangular geometry, that is, when it is a spectral space with quasi-compact opens given by complements of supports, and show that rigid centrally generated monoidal-triangulated categories satisfy this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23932v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous ping-pong for finite subgroups of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski-dense subgroup of a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ defined over a field $F$. Given a finite collection of finite subgroups $H_i$ ($i \in I$) of $\mathbf{G}(F)$ avoiding the center, we establish a criterion to ensure that the set of elements of $\Gamma$ that form a free product with every $H_i$ (the so-called simultaneous ping-pong partners for $H_i$) is both Zariski- and profinitely dense in $\Gamma$. This criterion applies namely to direct products $\mathbf{G}$ of inner $\mathbb{R}$-forms of $\operatorname{(P)GL}_n$, and gives a positive answer to this particular case of a question asked by Bekka, Cowling and de la Harpe. For torsion elements, a complication arises due to the fact that a finite cyclic group can split into a direct product. When $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of a semisimple algebra, we also give a more explicit method to obtain free products between two given finite subgroups, via first-order deformations.
  In the second half, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{G}$ is the multiplicative group of the group algebra $FG$ of a finite group $G$, and $\Gamma$ is the group of units of an order in $FG$. In this regard, we prove that the set of bicylic units that play ping-pong with a given shifted bicyclic unit, is Zariski- and profinitely dense, addressing a long-standing belief in the field of group rings. This result is deduced from the criterion above, combined with sharp existence results for well-behaved irreducible representations of $G$ that are center-preserving on a given subgroup.</description>

      <title>Violation of S-duality in classical $Q$-cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a chiral supercharge $Q$ in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory at tree level. The cohomology classes correspond one-to-one to the $\frac1{16}$ Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states at one-loop. We argue that monotone classes on the Coulomb branch respect the S-duality between the theories with $\mathrm{SO}(2N+1)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ gauge groups, but find an explicit example of a pair of cohomology classes that "violate" the S-duality in the sense that the tree-level $Q$-cohomologies are not isomorphic between the neighborhoods near the two free points. Within this pair, one is a fortuitous class and the other is a monotone chiral ring element. Assuming the non-perturbative validity of S-duality, our results disprove a long-standing conjecture on the one-loop exactness of the $\frac1{16}$-BPS spectrum (including the $\frac1{8}$-BPS chiral ring spectrum) in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Mathematically, this shows that, the relative Lie algebra cohomology $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}[A],\mathfrak{g})$ is generally not graded-isomorphic to $H^\bullet({}^L\mathfrak{g}[A],{}^L\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ and ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$ are a pair of Langlands dual Lie algebras and $A=\mathbb{C}[z^+,z^-]\otimes\Lambda(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of non-factorizable ribbon Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2503.19532 new examples of ribbon Hopf algebras based on the construction due to Nenciu were presented. This piece serves as a sequel where we study the representation theory of these new examples of ribbon Hopf algebras. We classify indecomposable projective and simple modules, find the Krull-Schmidt decomposition of the adjoint representation of Nenciu algebras, and prove fusion rules between its components. We also comment on the properties of M\"uger centres of their representation categories, in particular that they can be non-semisimple. Finally, we consider a new family of ribbon Hopf algebras over fields of prime characteristic $p&gt;2$ in the context of 4-dimensional TQFTs presented in arXiv:2306.03225 that constitute an improvement over examples given therein, although still seemingly falling short of producing powerful invariants of 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Duality in tensor-triangular geometry via proxy-smallness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a crystal base of the negative half of a quantum orthosymplectic superalgebra. It can be viewed as a limit of the crystal bases of $q$-deformed irreducible oscillator representations. We also give a combinatorial description of the embedding from the crystal of a $q$-oscillator representation to that of the negative half subalgebra given in terms of a PBW type basis. It is given as a composition of embeddings into the crystals of intermediate parabolic Verma modules, where the most non-trivial one is from an oscillator module to a maximally parabolic Verma module with respect to a quantum subsuperalgebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$. A new crystal theoretic realization of Burge correspondence of orthosymplectic type plays an important role for the description of this embedding.</description>

Abstract: Let $U$ be a tensor product of highest weight modules of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ corresponding to multiples of fundamental weights (i.e. rectangles). We consider three ways to stratify $U^{\otimes k}$ into components: using isotypic components of the cyclic action on tensor factors, using a generalization of the charge statistic, and using certain generalizations of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. We conjecture that all three ways coincide, and we prove that the latter two ways coincide. The Kirillov-Reshetikhin dual equivalence graphs (KR DEGs) we introduce for this purpose are defined on $0$-weight spaces of tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. They generalize Kazhdan-Lusztig dual equivalence graphs (KL DEGs) that previously appeared in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine type A. While the tensor products of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals are connected as affine crystals, the KR DEGs in general are not.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of representations of quivers with multiplicities via non-reductive GIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, i.e. over rings of truncated power series. This includes moduli of framed representations and analogues of Nakajima quiver varieties. Our construction relies on tools from relative affine Geometric Invariant Theory for non-reductive groups and new stability conditions for quiver representations with multiplicities. We also study the cohomology of smooth moduli spaces of quiver representations with multiplicities, and show that several of these moduli spaces are cohomologically pure, using torus actions, as is the case for Nakajima quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Classifying representations of finite classical groups of Lie type of dimension up to $\ell^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p&gt;2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of General Linear Supergroups in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop representation theory of general linear groups in the category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest tensor category which is not Frobenius exact. Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</description>

      <title>Universal Koszul Duality for Kac-Moody Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author.
  Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory.
  On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define new crystal maps on $B(\infty)$ using its polyhedral realization, and show that the crystal $B(\infty)$ equipped with the new crystal maps is isomorphic to Kashiwara's $B(\infty)$ as bicrystals. In addition, we combinatorially describe the bicrystal structure of $B(\infty)$, which is called a sliding diamond rule. Using the bicrystal structure on $B(\infty)$, we define the extended crystal and show that it is isomorphic to the extended crystal introduced by Kashiwara and Park.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the symmetry topological field theory/topological order correspondence (SymTFT/TO), together with the higher-categorical structure of 6D N =(2,0) SCFTs, we prove that the total quantum dimension of the relative gaugeable algebra leading to intrinsic non-invertible symmetries between class S theories is greater with respect to the non-intrinsic case. From a higher-categorical perspective, this supports the idea that multiplicity is allowed to exceed unity in some superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Complex crystallographic reflection groups and Seiberg-Witten integrable systems: rank 1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</description>

      <title>Rank one summands of Frobenius pushforwards of line bundles on G/P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X=G/P$ be a partial flag variety, where $G$ is a semi-simple, simply connected algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of positive characteristic. Let $\mathsf{F}\colon X\to X$ be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Given a line bundle $\mathscr{L}$ on $X$ and an integer $r\geq1$, we describe all line bundles that are direct summands of the pushforward $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. For $\mathscr{L}$ corresponding to a dominant weight, we also compute, for $r$ sufficiently large, the multiplicity of $\mathscr{O}_{X}$ as a summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}^{r}\mathscr{L}$. As an application we answer a question of Gros-Kaneda about the multiplcity of $\mathscr{L}(-\rho)$ as a direct summand of $\mathsf{F}_{*}\mathscr{O}_{G/B}$.</description>

      <title>On the invariants of finite groups arising in a topological quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate structural properties of finite groups that are detected by certain group invariants arising from Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, in one space and one time dimension. In this setting, each finite group $G$ determines a family of numerical invariants associated with closed orientable surfaces, expressed in terms of the degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$. These invariants can be viewed as natural extensions of the commuting probability $d(G)$, which measures the likelihood that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute and has been extensively studied in the literature. By analyzing these higher-genus analogues, we establish new quantitative criteria relating the values of these invariants to key structural features of finite groups, such as commutativity, nilpotency, supersolvability and solvability. Our results generalize several classical theorems concerning the commuting probability, thereby linking ideas from finite group theory and topological quantum field theory.</description>
