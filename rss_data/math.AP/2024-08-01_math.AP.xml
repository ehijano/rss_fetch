      <title>Construction of solutions for the critical polyharmonic equation with competing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following critical polyharmonic equation \begin{align*}%\label{abs} ( -\Delta)^m u+V(|y'|,y'')u=Q(|y'|,y'')u^{m^*-1},\quad u&gt;0, \quad y=(y',y'')\in \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{R}^{N-3},
  \end{align*} where $N&gt;4m+1$, $m\in \mathbb{N}^+$, $m^*=\frac{2N}{N-2m}$, $V(|y'|,y'')$ and $Q(|y'|,y'')$ are bounded nonnegative functions in $\mathbb{R}^+\times \mathbb{R}^{N-3}$. By using the reduction argument and local Poho\u{z}aev identities, we prove that if $Q(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point $(r_0,y_0'')$ with $r_0&gt;0$, $Q(r_0,y_0'')&gt;0$, $D^\alpha Q(r_0,y_0'')=0$ for any $|\alpha|\leq 2m-1$ and $B_1V(r_0,y_0'')-B_2\sum\limits_{|\alpha|=2m}D^\alpha Q(r_0,y_0'')\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}y^\alpha U_{0,1}^{m^*}dy&gt;0$, then the above problem has a family of solutions concentrated at points lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder, where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are positive constants that will be given later.</description>

      <title>Linear response and resonances in adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electrons of a molecule in the adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory approximation. We establish the well-posedness of the time evolution and its linear response close to a non-degenerate ground state, and prove the appearance of resonances at relevant frequencies. The main mathematical difficulty is due to the structure of the linearized equations, which are not complex-linear. We bypass this difficulty by reformulating the  linearized problem as a real Hamiltonian system, whose stability is ensured by the second-order optimality conditions on the energy.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 1. 3-D Insulating Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of steady-state for $3$-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with insulating boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We use Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to get the global existence of solutions around the steady state. Compared with the deterministic case, due to the stochastic forces, the momentum does not have the temporal derivative, which causes troubles to the energy estimates. We establish the asymptotic stability about the spatial derivatives by the weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from the deterministic case. The existence of invariant measure generated by the solutions to the evolving semiconductor equations is shown from the a priori energy estimates. Furthermore, the invariant measure is exactly the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, in which the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state plays an essential role.</description>

      <title>Optimal design problem with thermal radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with configurations of two-material thermal conductors that minimize the Dirichlet energy for steady-state diffusion equations with nonlinear boundary conditions described mainly by maximal monotone operators. To find such configurations, a homogenization theorem will be proved and applied to an existence theorem for minimizers of a relaxation problem whose minimum value is equivalent to an original design problem. As a typical example of nonlinear boundary conditions, thermal radiation boundary conditions will be the focus, and then the Fr\'echet derivative of the Dirichlet energy will be derived, which is used to estimate the minimum value. Since optimal configurations of the relaxation problem involve the so-called grayscale domains that do not make sense in general, a perimeter constraint problem via the positive part of the level set function will be introduced as an approximation problem to avoid such domains, and moreover, the existence theorem for minimizers of the perimeter constraint problem will be proved. In particular, it will also be proved that the limit of minimizers for the approximation problem becomes that of the relaxation problem in a specific case, and then candidates for minimizers of the approximation problem will be constructed by employing time-discrete versions of nonlinear diffusion equations. In this paper, it will be shown that optimized configurations deeply depend on force terms as a characteristic of nonlinear problems and will also be applied to real physical problems.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional metapopulation SIS model with generalized incidence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-dimension SIS model introduced by Delmas, Dronnier and Zitt, with a more general incidence rate, and study its equilibria. Unsurprisingly, there exists at least one endemic equilibrium if and only if the basic reproduction number is larger than 1. When the pathogen transmission exhibits one way propagation, it is possible to observe different possible endemic equilibria. We characterize in a general setting all the equilibria, using a decomposition of the space into atoms, given by the transmission operator. We also prove that the proportion of infected individuals converges to an equilibrium, which is uniquely determined by the support of the initial condition.We extend those results to infinite-dimensional SIS models with reservoir or with immigration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the singular mean field equation defined on a Riemann surface with a sign-changing potential function. We prove if some singular sources happen to be placed on the zero-level curve of the potential function, a priori estimate can still be obtained. As a consequence of this estimate, existence and multiplicity results can still be obtained based on the topology of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Effect of weak elasticity on Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in two-dimensional ideal compressible elastic flows, providing a rigorous confirmation that weak elasticity has a destabilizing effect on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. There are two critical velocities, $U_{\text{low}}$ and $U_{\text{upp}}$, where $U_{\text{low}}$ and $U_{\text{upp}}$ represent the lower and upper critical velocities, respectively. We demonstrate that if the rectilinear solutions satisfy $U_{\text{low}}+c\epsilon_{0}&lt; \dot{v}^{+}_{1} &lt; U_{\text{upp}}$, the linear and nonlinear ill-posedness of Kelvin-Helmholtz problem for two-dimensional ideal compressible elastic fluids is established.</description>

      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

Abstract: We show the explicit solution operator of an abstract Cauchy problem involving a time-variable coefficient and a fractional power of an almost sectorial operator. Also, by using the representation of the solution operator, we solve the inverse abstract Cauchy problem for recovering the time-variable coefficient. As a complement, we also study similar problems by using almost sectorial operators that depend on a time-variable.</description>

      <title>Scattering problem for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering problem for the initial value problem of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equation. The purpose of this paper is to achieve two primary goals. Firstly, we show small data scattering for (gKdV) in the weighted Sobolev space, ensuring the initial and the asymptotic states belong to the same class. Secondly, we introduce two equivalent characterizations of scattering in the weighted Sobolev space. In particular, this involves the so-called conditional scattering in the weighted Sobolev space. A key ingredient is incorporation of the scattering criterion for (gKdV) in the Fourier-Lebesgue space by the authors into the the scattering problem in the weighted Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Dirichlet problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity. When the viscosity coefficient $\mu(\rho)$ is a power function of the density ($\mu(\rho)=\mu\rho^\alpha$ with $\alpha&gt;1$), it is proved that the system will admit a unique global strong solution as long as the initial data are sufficiently large. This is the first result concerning the existence of large strong solution for the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Ne\v{c}as-Lions inequality with symmetric gradients on two and three dimensional domains of diameter $R$ that are star-shaped with respect to a ball of radius $\rho$; the constants in the inequality are explicit with respect to $R$ and $\rho$. Crucial tools in deriving this inequality are a first order Babu\v{s}ka-Aziz inequality based on Bogovski\u{i}'s construction of a right-inverse of the divergence and Fourier transform techniques proposed by Dur\'an. As a byproduct, we derive arbitrary order estimates in arbitrary dimension for that operator.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation for nonlinear variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the unique continuation properties of the solutions to nonlinear variational problems. Our analysis covers the case of nonlinear autonomous functionals depending on the gradient, as well as more general double phase and multiphase functionals with $(2,q)$-growth in the gradient. We show that all these cases fall in a class of nonlinear functionals for which we are able to prove weak and strong unique continuation via the almost-monotonicity of Almgren's frequency formula. As a consequence, we obtain estimates on the dimension of the set of points at which both the solution and its gradient vanish.</description>

      <title>Initial Data Identification for Conservation Laws with Spatially Discontinuous Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux at a single point $x=0$, and we study the initial data identification problem for $AB$-entropy solutions associated to an interface connection $(A,B)$. This problem consists in identifying the set of initial data driven by the corresponding $AB$-entropy solution to a given target profile~$\omega^T$, at a time horizon $T&gt;0$. We provide a full characterization of such a set in terms of suitable integral inequalities, and we establish structural and geometrical properties of this set. A distinctive feature of the initial set is that it is in general not convex, differently from the case of conservation laws with convex flux independent on the space variable. The results rely on the properties of the $AB$-backward-forward evolution operator introduced in~\cite{talamini_ancona_attset}, and on a proper concept of $AB$-genuine/interface characteristic for $AB$-entropy solutions provided in this paper.</description>

      <title>Comments on the regularity of harmonic maps between singular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we are going to establish H\"older continuity of harmonic maps from an open set $\Omega$ in an ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ space valued into a ${\rm CAT}(\kappa)$ space, with the constraint that the image of $\Omega$ via the map is contained in a sufficiently small ball in the target. Building on top of this regularity and assuming a local Lipschitz regularity of the map, we establish a weak version of the Bochner-Eells-Sampson inequality in such a non-smooth setting. Finally we study the boundary regularity of such maps.</description>

      <title>PDE formulation of some SABR/LIBOR market models and its numerical solution with a sparse grid combination technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SABR models have been used to incorporate stochastic volatility to LIBOR market models (LMM) in order to describe interest rate dynamics and price interest rate derivatives. From the numerical point of view, the pricing of derivatives with SABR/LIBOR market models (SABR/LMMs) is mainly carried out with Monte Carlo simulation. However, this approach could involve excessively long computational times. For first time in the literature, in the present paper we propose an alternative pricing based on partial differential equations (PDEs). Thus, we pose original PDE formulations associated to the SABR/LMMs proposed by Hagan \cite{haganSABRLIBOR}, Mercurio \&amp; Morini \cite{mercurioMorini} and Rebonato \cite{rebonatoWhite}. Moreover, as the PDEs associated to these SABR/LMMs are high dimensional in space, traditional full grid methods (like standard finite differences or finite elements) are not able to price derivatives over more than three or four underlying interest rates. In order to overcome this curse of dimensionality, a sparse grid combination technique is proposed. A comparison between Monte Carlo simulation results and the ones obtained with the sparse grid technique illustrates the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal problem with critical exponential nonlinearity of convolution type: A non-resonant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following class of weighted Choquard equations
  \begin{align*}
  -\Delta u =\lambda u + \Bigg(\displaystyle\int\limits_\Omega \frac{Q(|y|)F(u(y))}{|x-y|^\mu}dy\Bigg) Q(|x|)f(u) ~~\textrm{in}~~ \Omega~~ \text{and}~~
  u=0~~ \textrm{on}~~ \partial \Omega,
  \end{align*}
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, $\mu \in (0,2)$ and $\lambda &gt;0$ is a parameter. We assume that $f$ is a real valued continuous function satisfying critical exponential growth in the Trudinger-Moser sense, and $F$ is the primitive of $f$. Let $Q$ be a positive real valued continuous weight, which can be singular at zero. Our main goal is to prove the existence of a nontrivial solution for all parameter values except the resonant case, i.e., when $\lambda$ coincides with any of the eigenvalues of the operator $(-\Delta, H^1_0(\Omega))$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of positive radial solutions of Choquard type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Choquard type equation \begin{equation} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u+\lambda u=\gamma(\Phi_N(|x|)\ast|u|^p)u \ \ \mbox{in $\mathbb{R}^N$}, \\ &amp;\lim\limits_{|x|\to\infty}u(x)=0,\\ \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation}
  where $N\geq2,\lambda&gt;0,\gamma&gt;0, p\in[1,2]$ and $\Phi_N(|x|)$ denotes the fundamental solution of the Laplacian $-\Delta$ on $\mathbb{R}^N$. This equation does not have a variational frame when $p\neq 2.$ Instead of variational methods, we prove the existence and uniqueness of positive radial solutions of the above equation via the shooting method by establishing some new differential inequalities. The proofs are based on an analysis of the corresponding system of second-order differential equations, and our results extend the existing ones in the literature from $p=2$ to $p\in[1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the whole line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ be a smooth domain. We establish conditions under which a weakly conformal, branched $\Omega$-free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion $u$ of a disc in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is a $\Omega$-free boundary minimal immersion. We deduce that if $u$ is a weakly conformal, branched $B_1(0)$-free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion of a disc with Legendrian boundary data, then $u(D^2)$ must be a Lagrangian equatorial plane disc. We also present examples of $\Omega$-free boundary Hamiltonain stationary discs, demonstrating the optimality of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the Keller-Segel models interacting with a stochastically forced incompressible viscous flow in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07217v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the Keller-Segel model coupled to stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (KS-SNS, for short), which describes the dynamics of oxygen and bacteria densities evolving within a stochastically forced 2D incompressible viscous flow. Our main goal is to investigate the existence and uniqueness of global solutions (strong in the probabilistic sense and weak in the PDE sense) to the KS-SNS system. A novel approximate KS-SNS system with proper regularization and cut-off operators in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is introduced, and the existence of approximate solution is proved by some a priori uniform bounds and a careful analysis on the approximation scheme. Under appropriate assumptions, two types of stochastic entropy-energy inequalities that seem to be new in their forms are derived, which together with the Prohorov theorem and Jakubowski-Skorokhod theorem enables us to show that the sequence of approximate solutions converges to a global martingale weak solution. In addition, when $\chi(\cdot)\equiv \textrm{const.}&gt;0$, we prove that the solution is pathwise unique, and hence by the Yamada-Wantanabe theorem that the KS-SNS system admits a unique global pathwise weak solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the methods of commutator and fundamental solutions to establish averaging lemmas and hypoelliptic estimates for purely kinetic transport equations. Assuming certain amount of velocity regularity for solutions, we extend our analysis using the commutator method to derive the averaging and hypoelliptic regularity properties for kinetic equations in the presence of general inhomogeneous fluxes. These results find applications in the study of hypoelliptic advection-diffusion equations and kinetic formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws including Burgers' equation with transport.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of entropy solutions and gradient flows for pressureless 1D Euler systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributional solutions of pressureless Euler systems on the line. In particular we show that Lagrangian solutions, introduced by Brenier, Gangbo, Savar\'{e} and Westdickenberg, and entropy solutions, studied by Nguyen and Tudorascu for the Euler--Poisson system, are equivalent. For the Euler--Poisson system this can be seen as a generalization to second-order systems of the equivalence between $L^2$-gradient flows and entropy solutions for a first-order aggregation equation proved by Bonaschi, Carrillo, Di Francesco and Peletier. The key observation is an equivalence between Ole\u{\i}nik's E-condition for conservation laws and a characterization due to Natile and Savar\'{e} of the normal cone for $L^2$-gradient flows. This new equivalence allows us to define unique solutions after blow-up for classical solutions of the Euler--Poisson system with quadratic confinement due to Carrillo, Choi and Zatorska, as well as to describe their asymptotic behavior.</description>

Abstract: We establish resolvent estimates in $L^q$ spaces for the Stokes operator in a bounded $C^1$ domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a corollary, it follows that the Stokes operator generates a bounded analytic semigroup in $L^q(\Omega; \mathbb{C}^d)$ for any $1&lt; q&lt; \infty$ and $d\ge 2$. The case of an exterior $C^1$ domain is also studied.</description>

Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class solutions of the one dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of Mean-field Games (MFG) systems in the mass critical exponent case. We firstly establish the optimal Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality associated with the potential-free MFG system. Then, under some mild assumptions on the potential function, we show that there exists a critical mass $M^*$ such that the MFG system admits a least energy solution if and only if the total mass of population density $M$ satisfies $M&lt;M^*$. Moreover, the blow-up behavior of energy minimizers are captured as $M\nearrow M^*$. In particular, given the precise asymptotic expansions of the potential, we establish the refined blow-up behavior of ground states as $M\nearrow M^*.$ While studying the existence of least energy solutions, we establish new local $W^{2,p}$ estimates of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations with superlinear gradient terms.</description>

Abstract: We study the long time dynamics of the defocussing NLS equation. Compared with previous literature, we revisit the direct and inverse scattering map to obtain asymptotics in some weighted energy space that requires less restrictive decay and regularity assumptions. The main result is derived from an application of uniform resolvent bound and an approximation argument in the spirit of Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. As a consequence, our result depicts the long time dynamics of the zeros of the solution to the defocussing NLS equation.</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-spherical metrics and the static Minkowski inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that equality in the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static manifolds is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space. To show this, we establish uniqueness of *quasi-spherical* static metrics: rotationally symmetric regions of Schwarzschild are the only static vacuum metrics which are quasi-spherical with vanishing shear vector. In addition, we observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions for a connected boundary and to asymptotically flat static manifolds of any positive decay order. Altogether, this yields a robust rigidity criterion for Schwarzschild space.
  Using this criterion, we recover Israel's static black hole uniqueness theorem under this mild decay assumption. Likewise, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from the prequel extend to all dimensions under these weaker asymptotics. Finally, as a notable by-product of our analysis, we establish regularity of weak inverse mean curvature flow in asymptotically flat manifolds -- that is, a weak IMCF is eventually smooth in an arbitrary asymptotically flat background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an inexact gradient method based on incremental proper orthogonal decomposition (iPOD) to address the data storage difficulty in time-dependent PDE-constrained optimization, particularly for a data assimilation problem as a detailed demonstration for the key ideas. The proposed method is proved robust by rigorous analysis. We first derive a sharp data compression error estimate of the iPOD with the help of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Then we demonstrate a numerical PDE analysis to show how to properly choose the Hilbert space for the iPOD data compression so that the gradient error is under control. We further prove that for a convex problem with appropriately bounded gradient error, the inexact gradient method achieves the accuracy level of the optimal solution while not hurting the convergence rate compared with the usual gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results and validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A support preserving homotopy for the de Rham complex with boundary decay estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the de Rham complex of relative differential forms on compact manifolds with boundary. Chain homotopies for this complex are highly non-unique, and different homotopies can have different analytic properties, particularly near the boundary. We construct a chain homotopy that has desirable support propagation properties, and that satisfies estimates relative to weighted Sobolev norms, where the weights measure decay at the boundary. The estimates are optimal given the homogeneity properties of the de Rham differential under boundary dilation, and are obtained by showing that the homotopy is a b-pseudodifferential operator. As a corollary we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on Euclidean space that preserves support on large balls around the origin, and satisfies estimates that measure decay at infinity. Such a support preserving right inverse was constructed before by Bogovskii, but its mapping properties are not optimal with respect to decay. As a further corollary, in three dimensions we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on symmetric traceless matrices, and therefore of the linearized constraint operator of general relativity about flat space.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent series expansions for a class of resolvents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following advances in the abstract theory of composites, we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$ and that the actions of the projections ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ are easy to compute. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{{\bf Q}}$ that is no longer orthogonal. When $z$ is real the rate of convergence of the new method matches that of the conjugate gradient method.</description>

Abstract: The Maxwell-Bloch system of equations with inhomogeneous broadening is studied, and the local and global well-posedness of the corresponding initial-boundary value problem is established by taking advantage of the integrability of the system and making use of the corresponding inverse scattering transform. A key ingredient in the analysis is the $L^2$-Sobolev bijectivity of the direct and inverse scattering transform established by Xin Zhou for the focusing Zakharov-Shabat problem.</description>
