      <title>Dynamical dark energy in 0'B braneworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a novel realization of dark bubble cosmology in non-supersymmetric string theory. Among the simplest models in ten dimensions, the type 0'B orientifold is the unique option which yields a scale-separated construction. The resulting setting produces a logarithmically varying dynamical dark energy, reflecting its holographic counterpart in terms of running gauge couplings. We analyze in detail the phenomenological consequences of the model for particle physics, inflation and late-time cosmology. We find that, although particle physics may be consistently realized, neither early-time nor late-time are observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, with a particular focus on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This analysis is supported by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>The Characteristics of the Z-Boson in Chern-Simons Matter Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Chern-Simons theory coupled to massive fundamental matter in three spacetime dimensions, focusing on the Higgsed phase of the bosonic matter in the large N limit. To study the characteristics of the Z-boson in the Higgsed phase and address an apparent puzzle regarding its fermionic analogue, we employ the 3d Bose-Fermi duality to derive the exact large N result for the two-point function of the Z-boson. We study the spectral representation of the Z-boson and find that, in the large N limit, it behaves as an unstable resonance with a non-perturbatively large lifetime at weak coupling.</description>

      <title>Phantom RN-AdS black holes in noncommutative space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of noncommutativity on phantom Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black holes by modeling mass and charge distributions with Lorentzian profiles. The modified metric function exhibits significant deviations from the classical case, leading to changes in the horizon structure and the suppression of singularities. Through a comparative thermodynamic analysis, we derive expressions for the mass, Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, identifying stability conditions and phase transitions induced by noncommutative corrections. The efficiency of the black hole as a heat engine is evaluated, showing that noncommutativity influences the thermodynamic cycle differently in the presence of phantom fields. Furthermore, we investigate the orbital motion of test particles and photons, deriving the effective potential, innermost stable circular orbits, and the shadow profile. Finally, we compute quasinormal modes to assess dynamical stability, revealing that noncommutativity modifies the damping behavior and introduces a new branch of non-oscillatory modes, absent in the classical case. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between phantom fields, noncommutative geometry, and black hole thermodynamics, offering potential observational signatures for exotic compact</description>

      <title>Classification of Modular Symmetries in Type IIB Flux Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study modular symmetries in type IIB flux landscape by investigating symplectic basis transformations of period vectors on toroidal orbifolds. To fix explicit cycles of a third-cohomology basis regarding the untwisted complex structure modulus, which is necessary to construct the period vectors, we find that the following two symmetries are required for the period vectors: (i) ``Scaling duality '' which is a generalized $S$-transformation of $PSL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ and (ii) the modular symmetries to be consistent with symmetries derived from mass spectra of the closed string in type IIB string theory. Furthermore, by considering flux quanta on the cycles, we explore type IIB flux vacua on toroidal orientifolds and flux transformations under the modular symmetries of the period vectors.</description>

      <title>On the nonlinearity of Four-Dimensional Conformal Transformations in spinor representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinearity of the conformal group is an essential factor that ruins the global conformal invariance for interacting material fields. In this paper we attempt to track such nonlinearity from spacetime transformations to spinor representations. To this end we rederive the spinor representation by generalizing the linear fractional transformation from two dimensions to four dimensions via replacing complex numbers with biquaternions. To check the effect of the nonlinearity we apply the translations and special conformal transformations (SCTs) to Dirac spinors in certain interactions. These two transformations do not lead to nonlinear terms in Yukawa term, but do in vector-spinor interaction. And the nonlinear terms would definitely cause $CP$ violation.</description>

      <title>Is chiral supersymmetry emanant or emergent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Majorana Nicolai model is one of the simplest models of supersymmetry realized on a fermionic chain in $1+1$ dimensions. Within a certain parameter region, the extended theory breaks the supersymmetry spontaneously, but it has a distinguished feature that the general counting rule of the Nambu-Goldstone mode does not apply: we observe twice as many low-energy degrees of freedom than the broken lattice symmetry. We argue that the extra degrees of freedom originate from the spontaneous breaking of the emergent chiral supersymmetry. This chiral supersymmetry becomes an emanant symmetry in the non-interacting limit.</description>

      <title>Solitonic vortices and black holes with vortex hair in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study soliton and black hole solutions with scalar hair in AdS$_3$ in a theory with a Maxwell field and a charged scalar field with double trace boundary conditions, which can trigger the dual boundary theory to become a superconductor. We investigate the phase diagram as a function of the temperature $T$ and of the double trace coupling $\kappa$ and we find a rich pattern of phase transitions, which can be of the Hawking-Page kind or can be due to the condensation of the order parameter. We also find a transition between vortex solutions and the zero temperature limit of the black hole for a critical value of the double trace coupling $\kappa$. The Little-Park periodicity is realized for the dual of the black hole solution with hair as a shift in the winding number and in the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</description>

      <title>The momentum-space conformal bootstrap in 2d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new bootstrap equation in 2-dimensional conformal field theory is derived starting from the momentum-space representation of the correlation functions. Since Wightman functions are not crossing-symmetric, the analyticity properties of the commutator are leveraged instead to obtain a relation between two distinct operator product expansions. The procedure requires evaluating a 4-point function with two light-like momenta. The result is an asymmetric equation valid for arbitrary theories in 1d and 2d. The new crossing equation admits two simple projections onto orthogonal bases of Jacobi polynomials: one of these reproduces a known set of analytic functionals; the other gives rise to a new family of crossing equations with zeros at double-twist dimensions. We provide a few examples of applications of this new equation.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k,s$, we give a conjectural formula for the number $T(n,k,s)$ of order $k$ subsets of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose sum of elements is $s$ modulo $n$. To do so, we describe explicitly a sequence of matrices $M(k)$, for positive integers $k$, such that the size of $M(k)$ is the number of divisors of $k$, and for two coprime integers $k_{1},k_{2}$, the matrix $M(k_{1}k_{2})$ is the Kronecker product of $M(k_{1})$ and $M(k_{2})$. For $s=0, 1, 2$, and for $s=k/2$ when $k$ is even, the sequences $T(n,k,s)$ are related to the number of necklaces with $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads, and to Lyndon words. The conjecture has been tested against computations of $M(k)$ up to $k=10000$.</description>

      <title>Duality viewpoint of noninvertible symmetry protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generalized symmetries have drawn significant attention to gapped phases of matter exhibiting novel symmetries, such as noninvertible symmetries. By leveraging the duality transformations, the classification and construction of gapped phases with noninvertible symmetry can be mapped to those involving conventional group symmetries. We demonstrate this approach by classifying symmetry-protected topological phases with a broad class of noninvertible symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our results reveal new classifications that extend beyond those based on group symmetries. Additionally, we construct lattice models in $(1+1)d$ and $(2+1)d$ that realize these new phases and explore their anomalous interfaces.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Fluctuations and the Production of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the simplest possible candidates for dark matter is a stable scalar singlet beyond the Standard Model. If its mass is below the Hubble scale during inflation, long-wavelength modes of this scalar will be excited during inflation, and their subsequent evolution may lead to the correct relic density of dark matter. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of a spectator scalar. We examine three cases: (1) a non-interacting massive scalar, (2) a massive scalar with self-interactions of the form $\lambda_\chi \chi^p$, and (3) a massive scalar coupled to the inflaton $\phi$ through an interaction term of the form $\sigma_{n,m} \phi^n \chi^m$. In all cases, we assume minimal coupling to gravity and compare these results with the production of short-wavelength modes arising from single graviton exchange. The evolution is tracked during the reheating phase. Our findings are summarized using $(m_\chi, T_{\rm RH})$ parameter planes, where $m_\chi$ is the mass of the scalar field and $T_{\rm RH}$ is the reheating temperature after inflation. The non-interacting scalar is highly constrained, requiring $m_\chi &gt; 3 \times 10^{12}~\rm {GeV}$ and $ T_{\rm RH} \lesssim 7~\text{TeV}$ for an inflationary potential with a quadratic minimum. However, when self-interactions or couplings to the inflaton are included, the viable parameter space expands considerably. In these cases, sub-GeV and even sub-eV scalar masses can yield the correct relic abundance, opening new possibilities for light dark matter candidates. In all cases, we also impose additional constraints arising from the production of isocurvature fluctuations, the prevention of a secondary inflationary phase triggered by the spectator field, and the fragmentation of scalar condensates.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Gravity in Gravitational Wave Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new version v1.1 of NeatIBP. In this new version, a Kira interface is included. It allows the user to reduce the integration-by-parts (IBP) identity systems generated by NeatIBP using Kira in a highly automated way. This new version also implements the so-called spanning cuts method. It helps to reduce the total computational complexity of IBP reduction for certain hard problems. Another important feature of this new version is an algorithm to simplify the solution module of the syzygy equations hinted by the idea of maximal cuts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology built on the definition of metric through the prescription by Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). From the aspects of geometry, the presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global anisotropy offered in the Bianchi type I metrics, providing a new path to explore in the background of global anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a minimal renormalisable $SO(10)$ grand unified theory, with the Higgs representation $45_{\rm H}$, $126_{\rm H}$ and complex $10_{\rm H}$, responsible for the unification, intermediate and the weak scale symmetry breaking, respectively. We perform the study of unification constraints and find that it allows for the Left-Right symmetric scale to be accessible even at the LHC, and the Quark-Lepton unification scale as low as its phenomenological limit around $10^5\,$GeV. Moreover, one can have neutron - anti neutron oscillations at the level of the present day sensibility in both of the above cases, while in the former case one can have simultaneously neutrinoless double beta decay induced by new light scalar states, reachable today - with both electrons emerging as left-handed, as in the neutrino exchange through its possible Majorana mass. We also discuss a recently raised issue of the fine-tuning of the light Higgs mass and its potential conflict with low intermediate mass scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize basic features of quantum gravity states and processes, common to a number of related quantum gravity formalisms, and sharing a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties, and how a pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results (based on random tensor network techniques) on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of spider system's observables from orbital period modulations via the Applegate mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Redback and black widow pulsars are two classes of peculiar binary systems characterized by very short orbital periods, very low mass companions, and, in several cases, regular eclipses in their pulsed radio signal. Long-term timing revealed systematic but unpredictable variations in the orbital period, which can most likely be explained by the so-called Applegate mechanism. This relies on the magnetic dynamo activity generated inside the companion star and triggered by the pulsar wind, which induces a modification of the star's oblateness (or quadrupole variation). This, in turn, couples with the orbit by gravity, causing a consequent change in the orbital period. The Applegate description limits to provide estimates of physical quantities by highlighting their orders of magnitude. Therefore, we derive the time-evolution differential equations underlying the Applegate model, that is, we track such physical quantities in terms of time. Our strategy is to employ the orbital period modulations, measured by fitting the observational data, and implementing a highly accurate approximation scheme to finally reconstruct the dynamics of the spider system under study and the relative observables. Among the latter is the magnetic field activity inside the companion star, which is still a matter of debate for its complex theoretical modeling and the ensuing expensive numerical simulations. As an application, we exploit our methodology to examine two spider sources: 47 Tuc W (redback) and 47 Tuc O (black widow). The results obtained are analyzed and then discussed with the literature.</description>

Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: The well-known modular property of the torus characters and torus partition functions of (rational) vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) has been an invaluable tool for studying this class of theories. In this work we prove that sphere four-point chiral blocks of rational VOAs are vector-valued modular forms for the groups $\Gamma(2)$, $\Gamma_0(2)$, or $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, we prove that the four-point correlators, combining the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic chiral blocks, are modular invariant. In particular, in this language the crossing symmetries are simply modular symmetries. This gives the possibility of exploiting the available techniques and knowledge about modular forms to determine or constrain the physically interesting quantities such as chiral blocks and fusion coefficients, which we illustrate with a few examples. We also highlight the existence of a sphere-torus correspondence equating the sphere quantities of certain theories ${\mathcal T}_s$ with the torus quantities of another family of theories ${\mathcal T}_t$. A companion paper will delve into more examples and explore more systematically this sphere-torus duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine bounds on accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of the moduli space in string theory compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. While there are conjectures that forbid or constrain accelerated expansion in such asymptotic regions, potential counter examples have been discussed recently in the literature. We check whether such counter examples can arise in explicit string theory constructions, focusing in particular on non-geometric compactifications of type IIB string theory that have no K\"ahler moduli. We find no violation of the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture and thus provide support for the absence of accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of a barely explored corner of the string landscape. Moreover, working in a simplified setting, we point out a new mechanism for potentially connecting the Sharpened Distance Conjecture and the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture. If this argument could be generalized, it would mean that the Sharpened Distance Conjecture is implied by the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture, and that their exponential factors are naturally related by a factor of 2.</description>

Abstract: We develop further the investigations in arXiv:2210.12963 [hep-th] on de Sitter space, extremal surfaces and time entanglement. We discuss the no-boundary de Sitter extremal surface areas as certain analytic continuations from $AdS$ while also amounting to space-time rotations. The structure of the extremal surfaces suggests a geometric picture of the time-entanglement or pseudo-entanglement wedge. We also study some entropy relations for multiple subregions. The analytic continuation suggests a heuristic Lewkowycz-Maldacena formulation of the extremal surface areas. In the bulk, this is now a replica formulation on the Wavefunction which suggests interpretation as pseudo-entropy. Finally we also discuss aspects of future-past entangled states and time evolution.</description>

Abstract: We propose the Symmetry TFT for theories with a $U(1)$ symmetry in arbitrary dimension. The Symmetry TFT describes the structure of the symmetry, its anomalies, and the possible topological manipulations. It is constructed as a BF theory of gauge fields for groups $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$, and contains a continuum of topological operators. We also propose an operation that produces the Symmetry TFT for the theory obtained by dynamically gauging the $U(1)$ symmetry. We discuss many examples. As an interesting outcome, we obtain the Symmetry TFT for the non-invertible $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ chiral symmetry in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is in the same universality class of the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT), this being a paradigmatic example of the relation between a CPT and its quantum counterpart QPT. It is well known that a classical system in $d$ dimension is -- for short-range interactions -- in the same universality class of the same model in $d-1$ spatial dimension at $T=0$. Nevertheless, to extend the renormalization group (RG) equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies may lead to subtelties and even to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow, as we comment more in the text. Our goal in this work is to discuss this issue and map out the QPT-CPT diagram focusing as an example on the $\phi^4$ QFT, revisiting its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To this aim, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimesionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model.</description>

Abstract: The SymTFT construction is an efficient way of studying the symmetries of Quantum Field Theories. In this paper we initiate the study of the SymTFT construction for interacting theories on spaces with boundaries, in the concrete example of $d = 4$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions. The resulting SymTFT has a number of peculiarities, most prominently a fan-like structure with a number of different SymTFT sectors joined by gapless interfaces that merge at the Gaiotto-Witten boundary SCFT.</description>

      <title>Remote Hawking-Moss instanton and the Lorentzian path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and linear perturbations of ghost-free multi-spin-2 theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the spin-2 nature of gravity, we consider a theory of N interacting spin-2 fields, formulated in terms of vielbeins which have been argued to be free of the Boulware-Deser ghost. This is the only known such theory with nontrivial multi-field interactions. We develop an all-order expansion of the vielbein in terms of the metric and Lorentz field perturbations, enabling an expansion of the action in arbitrary backgrounds to any order. The mass matrix is then analysed around proportional vielbein solutions corresponding to vacuum Einstein spacetimes. It is shown that the theory exhibits a non-tachyonic spectrum with one massless and N-1 massive spin-2 modes, regardless of the sign of the cosmological constant. While the massless mode is universal, the non-zero masses cannot generally be determined analytically, but we obtain the lower and upper bounds on each mass eigenvalue in terms of the parameters of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider a bulk plus boundary extension of Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity (JT) coupled with non-abelian gauge fields. The generalization is performed in the Poisson Sigma Model formulation and it is derived as a dimensional reduction of the AdS3 Chern-Simons theory with WZW boundary terms. We discuss the role of boundary conditions in relation to the symmetries of the boundary dynamics and we show that the boundary action can be written in terms of coadjoint orbits of an appropriate Virasoro Kac-Moody group. We obtain a Schwarzian action and interaction terms with additional edge modes that match the effective low energy action of recent SYK-like tensor models.</description>

      <title>Non-metricity approach to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity based on a non-metricity tensor. In symmetric teleparallel gravity, we often use the scalar quantity $Q$ composed of the bilinear terms of the non-metricity tensor but $Q$ is not a unique scalar quantity from the viewpoint of covariance. However, other scalar quantities composed of the non-metricity tensor generate ghosts in general. In two dimensions, because a propagating gravitational mode does not exist, if we consider general scalar quantities, there might appear any propagating modes although these modes are often ghosts. We consider a general combination of the terms given by the bi-linear of the non-metricity tensors. After finding the condition that the conformal form of the metric is compatible with the coincident gauge, where connections vanish, we determine the combination so that a solution with constant curvature exists. The obtained model corresponds to 2d JT gravity in the framework of the symmetric teleparallel gravity. The conformal mode propagates as a scalar in this theory and we also consider the condition that the scalar mode is not a ghost.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Novel topological classes in black hole thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By viewing black hole solutions as topological defects in thermodynamic parameter space, we unveil a novel topological class and two new topological subclasses, respectively denoted $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, $\overline{W}^{1+}$, and $\hat{W}^{1+}$, that extend beyond the four established categories proposed by Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)]. Within the newly identified class and these two novel subclasses, the innermost small black hole states exhibit a distinct sequence of unstable, stable, and stable behaviours, while the outermost large black hole states display a uniform pattern of stable behaviours. These classifications indicate thermodynamic properties in both the low and high Hawking temperature regimes that are strikingly different from the previously known four topological classes. In particular, we demonstrate that static charged AdS black holes in gauged supergravity exhibit an intricate thermodynamic evolution that is notably distinct from that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole. From a topological perspective, we emphasize the advantages and potential of investigating thermodynamic phase transitions in these black hole spacetimes, an area that has been rarely explored in previous research. Our findings not only enrich and sharpen the framework of topological classifications in black hole thermodynamics, but also represent a significant stride toward unraveling the fundamental nature of black holes and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner (called the generalized Killing spinor) and use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity using the superspace formulation. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of generalized Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized Komar 2-form and of the on-shell closed 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of binary black hole mergers with their environments can be studied using numerical relativity simulations. These start only a short finite time before merger, at which point appropriate initial conditions must be imposed. A key task is therefore to identify the configuration that is appropriate for the binary and its environment at this stage of the evolution. In this work we study the behaviour of wave dark matter around equal mass black hole binaries, finding that there is a preferred, quasi-stationary profile that persists and grows over multiple orbits, in contrast to heavier mass dark matter where any overdensity tends to be dispersed by the binary motion. Whilst different initial configurations converge to the preferred quasi-stationary one after several orbits, unwanted transient oscillations are generated in the process, which may impact on the signal in short simulation runs. We also point out that naively superimposing the matter onto a circular binary results in artificially eccentric orbits due to the matter backreaction, which is an effect of the initial conditions and not a signature of dark matter. We discuss the further work required so that comparison of waveforms obtained with environments to vacuum cases can be done in a meaningful way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 4D gravitational model with a real scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms is considered. The action contains the potential $U(\varphi)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$. For a special static spherically symmetric metric $ds^2 = (A(u))^{-1} du^2 - A(u) dt^2 + u^2 d\Omega^2$, with $A(u) &gt; 0$ ($u &gt; 0$ is a radial coordinate), we verify the so-called reconstruction procedure suggested by Nojiri and Nashed. This procedure presents certain implicit relations for $U(\varphi)$ and $f(\varphi)$ which lead to exact solutions to the equations of motion for a given metric governed by $A(u)$. We confirm that all relations in the approach of Nojiri and Nashed for $f(\varphi(u))$ and $\varphi(u)$ are correct, but the relation for $U(\varphi(u))$ contains a typo which is eliminated in this paper. Here we apply the procedure to the (external) Schwarzschild metric with the gravitational radius $2 \mu $ and $u &gt; 2 \mu$. Using the ``no-ghost'' restriction (i.e., reality of $\varphi(u)$), we find two families of $(U(\varphi), f(\varphi))$. The first one gives us the Schwarzschild metric defined for $u &gt; 3 \mu$, while the second one describes the Schwarzschild metric defined for $2 \mu &lt; u &lt; 3 \mu$ ($3 \mu$ is the radius of the photon sphere). In both cases the potential $U(\varphi)$ is negative.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If these dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analogue Hawking radiation from acoustic horizons is now a well-established phenomenon, both theoretically and experimentally. Its persistence, despite the modified dispersion relations characterising analogue models, has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the robustness of this phenomenon against ultraviolet modifications of our spacetime description. However, previous theoretical approaches, such as the Bogoliubov transformation relating asymptotic states, have somewhat lacked a straightforward physical intuition regarding the origin of this robustness and its limits of applicability. To address this, we revisit analogue Hawking radiation using the tunneling method. We present a unified treatment that allows us to consider flows with and without acoustic horizons and with superluminal or subluminal dispersion relations. This approach clarifies the fundamental mechanism behind the resilience of Hawking radiation in these settings and explains the puzzling occurrence of excitations even in subcritical (supercritical) flows with subluminal (superluminal) dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Vortex lattices and critical fields in anisotropic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method is developed to compute minimal energy vortex lattices in a general Ginzburg-Landau model of a superconductor subjected to an applied magnetic field. The model may have any number of components and may be spatially anisotropic. The novelty of this method is that it makes no assumptions about the orientation of the vortex lines or the period vectors of the lattice's unit cell: these are all determined dynamically. Methods to compute the first and second critical magnetic fields, $H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$, in this class of models are also developed.
  These methods are applied to a simple anisotropic single-component model, and to an anisotropic two-component model of strong current theoretical interest (a so-called $s+id$ model). It is found, in both cases, that at low applied field the vortex lines can tilt very significantly away from the direction of the applied field (by as much as $40^\circ$ for the single-component and $30^\circ$ for the $s+id$ model). The optimal lattice in the $s+id$ model is qualitatively very different from the conventional triangular Abrikosov lattice, exhibiting a phase transition from a system of Skyrmion chains when the external field is orthogonal to the basal plane to a deformed Abrikosov lattice when applied in the basal plane.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry of interacting non-Hermitian birefringent Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy spectra of linearly dispersing gapless spin-3/2 Dirac fermions display birefringence, featuring two effective Fermi velocities, thus breaking the space-time Lorentz symmetry. Here, we consider a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of this scenario by introducing a masslike anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator to its Hermitian counterpart. At the microscopic level, a generalized $\pi$-flux square lattice model with imbalance in the hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions among spinless fermions between the nearest-neighbor sites gives rise to pseudospin-3/2 NH Dirac fermions in terms of internal, namely sublattice, degrees of freedom. The resulting NH operator shows real eigenvalue spectra over an extended NH parameter regime, and a combination of non-spatial and discrete rotational symmetries protects the gapless nature of such quasiparticles. However, at the brink of dynamic mass generation, triggered by Hubbardlike local interactions, the birefringent parameter always vanishes under coarse grain due to the Yukawa-type interactions with scalar bosonic order-parameter fluctuations. The resulting quantum critical state is, therefore, described by two decoupled copies of spin-1/2 Dirac fermions with a unique terminal Fermi velocity, which is equal to the bosonic order-parameter velocity, thereby fostering an emergent space-time Lorentz symmetry. Furthermore, depending on the internal algebra between the anti-Hermitian birefringent Dirac operator and the candidate mass order, the system achieves the emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry either by maintaining its non-Hermiticity or by recovering a full Hermiticity. We discuss the resulting quantum critical phenomena and possible microscopic realizations of the proposed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame, as required for the pole inflation. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying the general form of the Weyl invariant Lagrangian to both the Higgs pole inflation and the PQ pole inflation, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently in the case of the PQ pole inflation, due to a large effective axion decay constant during inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Moments from Momentum Derivatives in Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but "dressed" by the condensate profile) and the second to the "skewness" of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations when such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a nonlocal gravitational interaction can circumvent the Weinberg no-go theorem on cosmological constant, which forbids the existence of any solution to the cosmological constant problem within the context of local field theories unless some fine-tuning is assumed. In particular, Infinite Derivative Gravity theories hint at a possible understanding of the cosmological constant as a nonlocal gravitational effect on very large scales. In this perspective, one can describe the observed cosmic acceleration in terms of an effective field theory without relying on the fine-tuning of parameters or additional matter fields.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</description>
