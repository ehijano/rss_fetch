      <title>GTP before ATP: The energy currency at the origin of genes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life is an exergonic chemical reaction. Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic processes that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthetase (the ATPase), which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATPase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. Here we address two questions using comparative physiology: What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATPase? How (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27 percent of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.</description>

      <title>Generalised Taylor dispersion of chiral microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport phenomena of microswimmers in fluid flows play a crucial role in various biological processes, including bioconvection and cell sorting. In this paper, we investigate the dispersion behavior of chiral microswimmers in a simple shear flow utilizing the generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory, motivated by biased locomotion of bacterial swimmers known as bacterial rheotaxis. We thus focus on the influence of shear-induced torque effects due to particle chirality, employing an extended Jeffery equation for individual deterministic dynamics. We then numerically calculate macroscopic parameters including averaged swimming velocity and effective diffusion tensor using spherical harmonic expansion, and argue the obtained results based on the fixed points and their stability of the orientational dynamical systems. Our results reveal that chiral effects induce biased locomotion and we observe qualitative transitions in the orientational distribution with increasing Pecl\'et number, aligning with previous experimental findings. The diffusion tensor analysis highlights significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the flow plane due to chirality. This suggests potential applications in flow-mediated cell separation and we numerically demonstrate such chirality-induced fluid transportation. The presented methods will be useful in predicting and controlling dispersion behaviors of such chiral microswimmers.</description>

      <title>How motility drives the glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes a glass transition from a solid-like jammed to a fluid-like flowing state. Two primary characteristics of these systems, confluency, and self-propulsion, make them distinct from particulate systems. Are the glassy dynamics in these biological systems and equilibrium particulate systems different? Despite the biological significance of glassiness in these systems, no analytical framework, which is indispensable for deeper insights, exists. Here, we extend one of the most popular theories of equilibrium glasses, the random first-order transition (RFOT) theory, for confluent systems with self-propulsion. One crucial result of this work is that, unlike in particulate systems, the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of the active force, described by its rotational diffusion $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. Unlike in particulate systems, this value differs from the bare rotational diffusion of the active propulsion force due to cell shape dynamics which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small, and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We present simulation results for the glassy dynamics in active confluent models and find that the results are consistent with existing experimental data, and conform remarkably well with our theory. In addition, we show that the theoretical predictions agree nicely with and explain previously published simulation results. Our analytical theory provides a foundation for rationalizing and a quantitative understanding of various glassy characteristics of these biological systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of robust, universal conformal invariance in living biological matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective cellular movement plays a crucial role in many processes fundamental to health, including development, reproduction, infection, wound healing, and cancer. The emergent dynamics that arise in these systems are typically thought to depend on how cells interact with one another and the mechanisms used to drive motility, both of which exhibit remarkable diversity across different biological systems. Here, we report experimental evidence of a universal feature in the patterns of flow that spontaneously emerges in groups of collectively moving cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that the flows generated by collectively moving dog kidney cells, human breast cancer cells, and by two different strains of pathogenic bacteria, all exhibit conformal invariance. Remarkably, not only do our results show that all of these very different systems display robust conformal invariance, but we also discovered that the precise form of the invariance in all four systems is described by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE), and belongs to the percolation universality class. A continuum model of active matter can recapitulate both the observed conformal invariance and SLE form found in experiments. The presence of universal conformal invariance reveals that the macroscopic features of living biological matter exhibit universal translational, rotational, and scale symmetries that are independent of the microscopic properties of its constituents. Our results show that the patterns of flows generated by diverse cellular systems are highly conserved and that biological systems can unexpectedly be used to experimentally test predictions from the theories for conformally invariant structures</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation and Growth of Sessile Chemically Active Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets are essential for spatially controlling biomolecules in cells. To work properly, cells need to control the emergence and morphology of droplets. On the one hand, driven chemical reactions can affect droplets profoundly. For instance, reactions can control how droplets nucleate and how large they grow. On the other hand, droplets coexist with various organelles and other structures inside cells, which could affect their nucleation and morphology. To understand the interplay of these two aspects, we study a continuous field theory of active phase separation. Our numerical simulations reveal that reactions suppress nucleation while attractive walls enhance it. Intriguingly, these two effects are coupled, leading to shapes that deviate substantially from the spherical caps predicted for passive systems. These distortions result from anisotropic fluxes responding to the boundary conditions dictated by the Young-Dupr\'e equation. Interestingly, an electrostatic analogy of chemical reactions confirms these effects. We thus demonstrate how driven chemical reactions affect the emergence and morphology of droplets, which could be crucial for understanding biological cells and improving technical applications, e.g., in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Boundary geometry controls topological defect transitions that determine lumen nucleation in embryonic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D, where bulk-surface coupling can render the geometry of confining boundaries relevant. This is particularly important in living matter, where 2D topological defects have been linked to essential biological functions, whereas the role of 3D defects is unclear. Motivated by multicellular systems interacting with extracellular boundaries, we consider a polar fluid confined within curved boundaries imposing weak surface anchoring. We report a novel charge-preserving transition between different defect configurations, controlled by the boundary shape, and invariant to changes in the material parameters. We test if this geometry-driven transition occurs in confined multicellular systems and investigate the biological role of 3D polar defects in the mouse epiblast -- an embryonic tissue consisting of apico-basally polarised cells. We find that fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for subsequent embryonic development -- tend to form near defect positions of polar fluids in embryo-like confinement geometries. Moreover, by experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we trigger the formation of additional lumen nucleation sites at the predicted position. Thus, our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. Because this defect control principle is independent of specific material properties, we expect it to apply universally to systems with orientational order.</description>

      <title>AI-powered simulation-based inference of a genuinely spatial-stochastic model of early mouse embryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how multicellular organisms reliably orchestrate cell-fate decisions is a central challenge in developmental biology. This is particularly intriguing in early mammalian development, where early cell-lineage differentiation arises from processes that initially appear cell-autonomous but later materialize reliably at the tissue level. In this study, we develop a multi-scale, spatial-stochastic simulator of mouse embryogenesis, focusing on inner-cell mass (ICM) differentiation in the blastocyst stage. Our model features biophysically realistic regulatory interactions and accounts for the innate stochasticity of the biological processes driving cell-fate decisions at the cellular scale. We advance event-driven simulation techniques to incorporate relevant tissue-scale phenomena and integrate them with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), building on a recent AI-based parameter learning method: the Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) algorithm. Using this framework, we carry out a large-scale Bayesian inferential analysis and determine parameter sets that reproduce the experimentally observed system behavior. We elucidate how autocrine and paracrine feedbacks via the signaling protein FGF4 orchestrate the inherently stochastic expression of fate-specifying genes at the cellular level into reproducible ICM patterning at the tissue scale. This mechanism is remarkably independent of the system size. FGF4 not only ensures correct cell lineage ratios in the ICM, but also enhances its resilience to perturbations. Intriguingly, we find that high variability in intracellular initial conditions does not compromise, but rather can enhance the accuracy and precision of tissue-level dynamics. Our work provides a genuinely spatial-stochastic description of the biochemical processes driving ICM differentiation and the necessary conditions under which it can proceed robustly.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Vertical Diversity under Disturbance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>
