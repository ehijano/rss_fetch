      <title>A Constant-Approximation Algorithm for Budgeted Sweep Coverage with Mobile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first constant-approximation algorithm for {\em budgeted sweep coverage problem} (BSC). The BSC involves designing routes for a number of mobile sensors (a.k.a. robots) to periodically collect information as much as possible from points of interest (PoIs). To approach this problem, we propose to first examine the {\em multi-orienteering problem} (MOP). The MOP aims to find a set of $m$ vertex-disjoint paths that cover as many vertices as possible while adhering to a budget constraint $B$. We develop a constant-approximation algorithm for MOP and utilize it to achieve a constant-approximation for BSC. Our findings open new possibilities for optimizing mobile sensor deployments and related combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Inference for decorated graphs and application to multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graphon is a limiting object used to describe the behaviour of large networks through a function that captures the probability of edge formation between nodes. Although the merits of graphons to describe large and unlabelled networks are clear, they traditionally are used for describing only binary edge information, which limits their utility for more complex relational data. Decorated graphons were introduced to extend the graphon framework by incorporating richer relationships, such as edge weights and types. This specificity in modelling connections provides more granular insight into network dynamics. Yet, there are no existing inference techniques for decorated graphons. We develop such an estimation method, extending existing techniques from traditional graphon estimation to accommodate these richer interactions. We derive the rate of convergence for our method and show that it is consistent with traditional non-parametric theory when the decoration space is finite. Simulations confirm that these theoretical rates are achieved in practice. Our method, tested on synthetic and empirical data, effectively captures additional edge information, resulting in improved network models. This advancement extends the scope of graphon estimation to encompass more complex networks, such as multiplex networks and attributed graphs, thereby increasing our understanding of their underlying structures.</description>

      <title>Time arrow without past hypothesis: a toy model explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of Physics are time-reversible, making no qualitative distinction between the past and the future -- yet we can only go towards the future. This apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion. We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death. The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are fundamental measures in transport geography and urban planning. Conventional street network data and analysis tools often lead to significant overcounting of these measures. This study investigates the causes of such overcounting and proposes remedies. It introduces algorithms to streamline urban street network models through edge simplification and node consolidation, which enhance computational efficiency and improve accuracy in network measures like intersection counts, street segment lengths, and node degrees. The algorithms are validated and subjected to a global empirical assessment to evaluate the extent of count bias. These findings highlight the prevalence of this bias and underscore the necessity for better methods to mitigate inaccuracies in intersection representation.</description>
