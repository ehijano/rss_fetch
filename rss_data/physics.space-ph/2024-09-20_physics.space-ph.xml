      <title>Radial Diffusion Driven by Spatially Localized ULF Waves in the Earth's Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves are critical drivers of particle acceleration and loss in the Earth's magnetosphere. While statistical models of ULF-induced radial transport have traditionally assumed that the waves are uniformly distributed across magnetic local time (MLT), decades of observational evidence show significant MLT localization of ULF waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents, for the first time, a quasi-linear radial diffusion coefficient accounting for localized ULF waves. We demonstrate that even though quasi-linear radial diffusion is averaged over drift orbits, MLT localization significantly alters the efficiency of particle transport. Our results reveal that when ULF waves cover more than 30\% of the MLT, the radial diffusion efficiency is comparable to that of uniform wave distributions. However, when ULF waves are confined within 10\% of the drift orbit, the diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 10 to 25\%, indicating that narrowly localized ULF waves are efficient drivers of radial transport.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Total Solar Irradiance during the last Millenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar irradiance variations across various timescales, from minutes to centuries, represents a potential natural driver of past regional and global climate cold phases. To accurately assess the Sun's effect on climate, particularly during periods of exceptionally low solar activity known as grand minima, an accurate reconstruction of solar forcing is essential. While direct measurements of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) only began in the late 1970s with the advent of space radiometers, indirect evidence from various historical proxies suggests that the Sun's magnetic activity has undergone possible significant fluctuations over much longer timescales. Employing diverse and independent methods for TSI reconstruction is essential to gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study employs a semi-empirical model to reconstruct TSI over the past millennium. Our approach uses an estimated open solar magnetic field ($F_{o}$), derived from cosmogenic isotope data, as a proxy for solar activity. We reconstruct the cyclic variations of TSI, due to the solar surface magnetic features, by correlating $F_{o}$ with the parameter of active region functional form. Instead, we obtain the long-term TSI trend by applying the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm to the reconstructed $F_{o}$ to filter out the 11-year and 22-year solar variability. We prepare a reconstructed TSI record, spanning 971 to 2020 CE. The estimated departure from modern TSI values occurred during the Sp\"{o}rer Minimum (around 1400 CE), with a decrease of approximately 2.3 $W m^{-2}$. A slightly smaller decline of 2.2 $W m^{-2}$ is reported during the Maunder Minimum, between 1645 and 1715 CE.</description>
