      <title>Entropy production and irreversibility in the linearized stochastic Amari neural model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One among the most intriguing results coming from the application of statistical mechanics to the study of brain is the understanding that it, as a dynamical system, is inherently out of equilibrium. In the realm of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic processes the standard observable computed to discriminate whether a system is at equilibrium or not is the entropy produced along the dynamics. For this reason we present here a detailed calculation of the entropy production in the Amari model, a coarse-grained model of the brain neural network, consisting in an integro-differential equation for the neural activity field, when stochasticity is added to the original dynamics. Since the way to add stochasticity is always to some extent arbitrary, i.e., in particular for coarse-grained models, there is no general prescription to do it, we precisely investigate the interplay between the noise properties and the original model features, discussing in which cases the stationary state is of thermal equilibrium and which cases is out of equilibrium, providing explicit and simple formulas. We also show how, following for the derivation the particular case considered, how the entropy production rate is related to the variation in time of the Shannon entropy of the system.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport by a Lagrangian dynamics of population distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility, enabled by diverse transportation modes, is fundamental to urban functionality. Studying these movements across scales-from microscopic to macroscopic-yields valuable insights into urban dynamics. Local adaptation and (self-)organization in such systems are expected to result in dynamical behaviors that are represented by stationary trajectories of an appropriate effective action. In this study we develop a Lagrangian dynamical model for movement processes, using local population functions as the coordinate variables. An efficient gradient descent algorithm is introduced to estimate the optimal Lagrangian parameters minimizing a local error function of the dynamical process. We show that even a quadratic Lagrangian, incorporating dissipation, effectively captures the dynamics of synthetic and empirical movement data. The inferred models reveal that inertia and dissipation are of comparable importance, while interactions and randomness in the movements induce significant qualitative changes in model parameters. Our results provide an interpretable and generative model for human mobility, with potential applications in movement prediction.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free subspaces in the noisy dynamics of discrete-step quantum walks in a photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of periodically driven, discrete-step quantum walks in a one-dimensional photonic lattice. We find that in the bulk, temporal noise that is constant within a Floquet period leads to decoherence-free momentum subspaces, whereas fully random noise destroys coherence in a few time-steps. When considering topological edge states, we observe decoherence no matter the type of temporal noise. To explain these results, we derive a non-perturbative master equation to describe the system's dynamics and experimentally confirm our findings in a discrete mesh photonic lattice implemented in a double-fibre ring setup. Surprisingly, our results show that a class of bulk states can be more robust to a certain type of noise than topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Spectral Thresholds in Correlated Spiked Models and Fundamental Limits of Partial Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous random matrix theory analysis of spiked cross-covariance models where the signals across two high-dimensional data channels are partially aligned. These models are motivated by multi-modal learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite detectability being possible in principle. These findings clarify the theoretical limits of PLS and provide guidance for the design of reliable multi-modal inference methods in high dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework based on the cavity and replica methods to analyze the spectral properties of sparse asymmetric correlation matrices of the form $\boldsymbol{F} = (\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{Y}^\top + \omega \boldsymbol{Y}\boldsymbol{X}^\top)/2T$, where $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ are adjacency matrices of weighted Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs. We examine how the spectral density evolves as the asymmetry parameter $\omega$ varies from $0 &lt; \omega &lt; 1$ (nearly symmetric matrices) to $-1 &lt; \omega \le 0$ (nearly antisymmetric matrices). Analytical predictions are validated through exact numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement with theoretical results in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10\% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly outperform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Absolute abstraction: a renormalisation group approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton quantum simulation of the generalized Hopfield memory model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we introduce, develop, and investigate a connection between multiphoton quantum interference, a core element of emerging photonic quantum technologies, and Hopfieldlike Hamiltonians of classical neural networks, the paradigmatic models for associative memory and machine learning in systems of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we show that combining a system composed of Nph indistinguishable photons in superposition over M field modes, a controlled array of M binary phase-shifters, and a linear-optical interferometer, yields output photon statistics described by means of a p-body Hopfield Hamiltonian of M Ising-like neurons +-1, with p = 2Nph. We investigate in detail the generalized 4-body Hopfield model obtained through this procedure and show that it realizes a transition from a memory retrieval to a memory black-out regime, i.e. a spin-glass phase, as the amount of stored memory increases. The mapping enables novel routes to the realization and investigation of disordered and complex classical systems via efficient photonic quantum simulators, as well as the description of aspects of structured photonic systems in terms of classical spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between the intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to different phases. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>
