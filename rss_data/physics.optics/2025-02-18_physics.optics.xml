      <title>Inverse design of 3D-printable metalenses with complementary dispersion for terahertz imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study formulates a volumetric inverse-design methodology to generate a pair of complementary focusing metalenses for terahertz imaging: the two lenses exhibit equal and opposite shifts in focal length with frequency. An asymmetry arises, where we find a focal length that decreases with frequency to be more challenging to achieve (without material dispersion) given fabrication constraints, but it is still possible. We employ topology optimization, coupled with manufacturing constraints, to explore fully freeform designs compatible with 3D printing. Formulating an optimization problem that quantifies the goal of maximal complementary focal shifts, while remaining differentiable and tractable, requires a carefully selected sequence of constraints and approximations.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Control of the Speed of Light Using Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate nonreciprocal control of the speed of light by sending a microwave pulse through a cavity magnonics device. In contrast to reciprocal group velocity controlled by conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect, incorporating dissipative magnon-photon coupling establishes a non-reciprocal EIT effect, allowing slow and fast light propagation in opposite directions at the same frequency with comparable amplitude. Remarkably, reversing the magnetic field enables a directional switch between non-reciprocal fast and slow light. This discovery may offer new possibilities for pulse time regulation in microwave signal communications, neuromorphic computing, and quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Deformation of Optical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the noncommutative deformation of different optical states. We
  develop the deformed coherent state by using the raising and lowering operators of the
  quantum harmonic oscillator. This helps us to investigate the noncommutative deformation
  of a squeezed state in terms of noncommutative parameter, which in turn leads to the
  noncommutative deformation of a photon-added coherent state. This noncommutative
  deformation has an overall effect on the non-classicality of such states. This is done by
  investigating the impact of noncommutative deformation of the Mandal parameter for such
  states.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Unpinned Dirac Points in Defected Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpinned Dirac points (DPs) are nodal point degeneracies that occur at generic momentum points lacking high symmetry, often exhibiting characteristics typically forbidden by symmetry. While this phenomenon has been observed in solid-state materials, the formation of unpinned DPs in photonic crystals has not been extensively studied. This study presents a novel approach to achieving unpinned DPs in two-dimensional ``defected photonic crystals"-photonic superlattices created by modifying the size or refractive index of dielectric disks at specific sites. The defected photonic crystal hosts multiple unpinned DPs through accidental band crossings induced by rotational symmetry breaking across the nodal line degeneracies prevalent in the superlattice. Furthermore, the number of unpinned DPs, along with their positions and anisotropic dispersions, can be manipulated by adjusting the size or refractive index of the dielectric disks. This study pioneers the exploration of defected photonic crystals, proposing them as effective means of achieving unpinned DPs and facilitating the investigation of novel relativistic photonic wave phenomena with significant flexibility and control.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-energy and high-speed micro-laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy using GHz repetition rate pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using GHz repetition rate pulses in burst mode has demonstrated numerous advantages for highly efficient material removal. In this work, we present high-speed (over 100 kHz) micro-laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (micro-LIBS) with ultra-low pulse energies in the range of 10-200 nJ using our recently developed 2.8 GHz burst-mode Yb-doped fiber laser. We delivered 40 ps-long pulses to the sample with a beam diameter of about 18 microns. A systematic LIBS study was conducted on stainless steel (SS) at different burst durations and burst energies to study their effects on the optical emission spectrum. Finally, the electron temperature and electron density were determined using the Boltzmann plot method and Stark-broadened line profile analysis, respectively.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ptychography Reconstruction using the Hessian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography reconstruction is typically performed using first-order methods, such as gradient descent, due to their computational efficiency. Higher-order methods, while potentially more accurate, are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. In this study, we present a mathematical formulation for reconstruction using second-order information, derived from an efficient computation of the bilinear Hessian and Hessian operator. The formulation is provided for both Gaussian and Poisson models, enabling the simultaneous reconstruction of the object, probe, and positions. Synthetic data tests, along with experimental near-field ptychography data processing, demonstrate an 10x performance improvement compared to first-order methods. The derived formulas for computing the Hessians, along with the strategies for incorporating them into optimization schemes, are well-structured and easily adaptable to various ptychography problem formulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of calibrating a polarimetric back-scattering setup with a beamsplitter, taking into account its optical properties. We justify, via Fisher information, a special calibration configuration of reference optical elements for the maximum likelihood method and demonstrate its effectiveness numerically through Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering the beamsplitter's optical properties by proposing a test to estimate the error resulting from neglecting these properties during the calibration procedure.</description>

      <title>Enabling High-Bandwidth Coherent Modulation Through Scalable Lithium Niobate Resonant Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact, resonant-based coherent modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, addressing the growing demand for high-speed, energy-efficient modulators in modern telecommunications. The design incorporates Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) with a Gires-Tournois etalon in each arm with a modulation region of only ~80 micrometers, eliminating the need for traveling-wave electrodes and enabling compatibility with wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Experimental results demonstrate a modulation bandwidth of 29 GHz, while ensuring low optical loss and high scalability. Our architecture supports in-phase and out-of-phase modulation, enabling differential control of amplitude and phase for advanced modulation formats such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Compared to previous designs, our approach enhances throughput, modulation density, and scalability, making it ideal for applications in coherent communications and optical computing. By combining the advantages of the TFLN platform with innovative resonator engineering, this work advances the development of compact, high-performance modulators for high-density on-chip communication networks.</description>

      <title>High-power quantum walk frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power, broadband frequency combs generated by semiconductor lasers have profound implications for on-chip spectroscopy. Here, we present a dry-etched racetrack quantum cascade laser that uses resonant radio-frequency injection to produce a unidirectional quantum walk frequency comb at mid-infrared wavelengths. Efficient light outcoupling from the racetrack resonator provides more than 100 mW of continuous-wave output power at room temperature, with beam quality on par with that of Fabry--Perot lasers. Experimental waveform reconstruction confirms that the combs are frequency-modulated, rather than amplitude-modulated (as in active mode-locking). We show excellent agreement between the experimental waveforms and numerical simulations, which are based on a reduced Maxwell--Bloch model of the laser and include fast gain dynamics, finite group velocity dispersion, and large Kerr nonlinearity. Furthermore, our optimized device architecture -- featuring thick Si3N4 passivation and reduced parasitic capacitance -- enables modulation bandwidths exceeding 10 GHz. Combined with high output powers and the potential for monolithic integration of multiple ring lasers and waveguide couplers, these advances pave the way to fully integrated dual-comb spectrometers.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of an arbitrary elliptical polarization operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a theorem for transforming the polarization eigenstates of an arbitrary elliptical birefringent device into the eigenstates of another similar device by means of a birefringent device. The theorem is applied to synthesize a specific birefringent device from a circular birefringent device, and a practical setup is described. The resulting birefringence and birefringent axis of the synthesized device can be independently set or modulated. Finally, the theorem is extended to elliptical dichroic devices and elliptical polarizers.</description>

      <title>Compact Turnkey Soliton Microcombs at Microwave Rates via Wafer-Scale Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in nonlinear microresonators facilitate the photonic integration of timing, frequency synthesis, and astronomical calibration functionalities. For these applications, low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs are essential as they establish a coherent link between optical and microwave signals. However, the required pump power typically scales with the inverse of the repetition rate, and the device footprint scales with the inverse of square of the repetition rate, rendering low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs challenging to integrate within photonic circuits. This study designs and fabricates silicon nitride microresonators on 4-inch wafers with highly compact form factors. The resonator geometries are engineered from ring to finger and spiral shapes to enhance integration density while attaining quality factors over 10^7. Driven directly by an integrated laser, soliton microcombs with repetition rates below 10 GHz are demonstrated via turnkey initiation. The phase noise performance of the synthesized microwave signals reaches -130 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset frequency for 10 GHz carrier frequencies. This work enables the high-density integration of soliton microcombs for chip-based microwave photonics and spectroscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative metasurfaces enabled diverse quantum path entanglement of structured photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, lies at the heart of many current and future quantum technologies. A pivotal task is generation and control of diverse quantum entangled states in a more compact and flexible manner. Here, we introduce an approach to achieve diverse path entanglement by exploiting the interaction between noncommutative metasurfaces and entangled photons. Different from other path entanglement, our quantum path entanglement is evolvement path entanglement of photons on Poincar\'e sphere. Due to quantum entanglement between idler photons and structured signal photons, evolvement path of idler photons on the fundamental Poincar\'e sphere can be nonlocally mirrored by structured signal photons on any high-order Poincar\'e sphere, resulting in quantum path entanglement. Benefiting from noncommutative metasurfaces, diverse quantum path entanglement can be switched across different higher-order Poincar\'e spheres using distinct combination sequences of metasurfaces. Our method allows for the tuning of diverse quantum path entanglement across a broad spectrum of quantum states, offering a significant advancement in the manipulation of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous optical power delivery and distributed sensing through cross-band wavelength multiplexing over fiber link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fibers offer significant advantages in both power delivery and distributed sensing. In remote areas where stable power supply is not easy to access, the distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) which offers long distance monitoring capability and the power-over-fiber (PoF) which can provide energy for connected electronics or other sensors are highly desired simultaneously. In this letter, the PoF-DOFS hybrid system is proposed and experimentally verified for the first time. By multiplexing the power channel and sensing channel with large wavelength separation, the cross-talk is greatly reduced. The results show that the Brillouin frequency shift under different temperature in the Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry remains unaffected by the high-power transmission background and the power delivery efficiency up to ~66% can be achieved over 1.3 km fiber link. This work paves the way for further research on PoF-DOFS hybrid system and gives a valuable solution for creating multi-parameter, multi-scale sensing network without the need for local power source.</description>

      <title>Self-injection locking dynamics with Raman actions in AlN microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-injection locking (SIL) of semiconductor lasers to on-chip microcavities enables significant laser noise purification and diverse nonlinear optical actions. Realizing nonlinear SIL in new material platforms is essential for advancing photonic integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear SIL in AlN microcavities that generates stimulated Raman lasers (SRLs) and microcombs. We achieve SRL emission with an output power exceeding 10 mW and a fundamental linewidth below 70 Hz in the 1750 nm band. The Kerr effect further mediates stimulated emissions at the 2nd-Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies. Multi-time-scale thermal relaxations during turnkey SIL enable GHz-level frequency sweeps of the SRL and pump. Raman actions also render a Stokes platicon microcomb state with co-emission in the pump and Stokes bands. Hybrid-integrated crystalline microresonators can be a versatile platform to investigate nonlinear photon-phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Tri-layer SiN-on-Si 8x8 Optical Switches with Thermo-optic and Electro-optic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two spatial-multiplexed switch-and-select (S&amp;S) 8x8 optical switches incorporating a tri-layer SiN-on-Si platform, one equipped with thermo-optic (T-O) and the other electro-optic (E-O) switching elements. To the best of our knowledge, the electro-optic switch fabric is the first-of-its-kind device assembled in such a multi-layer platform. The shuffle between the multiplexer and demultiplexer array is established via a tri-layer Si-SiN-SiN structure, creating a three-dimensional crossing-free photonic shuffle network. At the same time, the implementation of the S&amp;S topology can effectively suppress the first-order crosstalk. The measured on-chip losses for the T-O switch range from 2.1 to 11.5 dB, with a 5.2 dB average, while the E-O device exhibits losses between 8.7 to 19.6 dB, with a 15.1 dB average. Both switches demonstrate ultra-low crosstalk, with measured ranges of 38.9 to 50.8 dB and 42.8 to 51.9 dB, for the T-O and E-O devices respectively. The switching times are 17.6 us for the T-O switch and 5.9 ns with the E-O actuated one. These performance metrics highlight the potential of these switches for next-generation data center applications.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of biological cells using surface plasmon coupled emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological cell imaging has become one of the most crucial research interests due to its wide-ranging applications in biomedical and microbiology studies. However, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological cells remains critically challenging and often requires prohibitively expensive and complex equipment. Therefore, a low-cost imaging technique with a simpler optical arrangement is highly desirable. We propose an approach to obtain accurate 3D cell images using surface plasmon coupled emission (SPCE) patterns from a fluorescently labeled biological cell, eliminating the need for conventional microscopes or extensive data processing. An imaging methodology has been developed and theoretically demonstrated to reconstruct 3D cell structures from detected SPCE patterns. The reconstructed 3D images closely match the actual cell geometries. The technique has been applied to both regular and irregular cell shapes. In each case, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the reconstructed images and the actual structures remains within a few percent. For a circular-shaped cell base, the RMSE is $\lesssim 1.4%$, while for irregular cell bases, the RMSE is $\lesssim 2.8%$. Finally, a 3D image of a random cellular structure is obtained with an RMSE of $\lesssim 6.5%$. Despite being in its initial stages of development, the proposed technique demonstrates promising results considering its simplicity and low cost.</description>

      <title>Observation of space-time surface plasmon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are surface-bound waves at metal-dielectric interfaces that exhibit strong out-of-plane field confinement, a key feature for applications is nano-scale sensing and imaging. However, this advantage is offset by diffractive spreading during in-plane propagation, leading to transverse spatial delocalization. Conventional strategies to combat diffraction through spatial structuring are not applicable for dimensionally restricted SPPs -- except for cosine plasmons that are not localized or Airy plasmons that propagate along a curved trajectory. Here, we report the first realization of space-time SPPs (ST-SPPs), ultrashort (16 fs) diffraction-free SPPs that propagate in a straight line, whose unique propagation characteristics stem from precise sculpting of their spatiotemporal spectra. By first synthesizing a spatiotemporally structured field in free space, we couple the field to an axially invariant ST-SPP at a metal-dielectric surface via an ultra-broadband nanoslit coupling mechanism, further enabling control over the ST-SPP group velocity and propagation characteristics. Time-resolved two-photon fluorescence interference microscopy enables reconstructing the surface-bound field in space and time, thereby verifying their predicted phase-tilted spatiotemporal wave-front and diffraction-free propagation. Our work opens new avenues for combining spatiotemporally structured light with the field-localization associated with nanophotonics, and may thus enable novel applications in surface-enhanced sensing and nonlinear optical interactions.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Low Concentration Barrier of Single-Molecule Fluorescence Quantification to the Sub-Picomolar Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence techniques provide exceptional sensitivity to probe biomolecular interactions. However, their application to accurately quantify analytes at the picomolar concentrations relevant for biosensing remains challenged by a severe degradation in the signal-to-background ratio. This so-called 'low concentration barrier' is a major factor hindering the broad application of single-molecule fluorescence to biosensing. Here we break into the low concentration limit while keeping intact the confocal microscope architecture and without requiring complex microfluidics or preconcentration stages. Using fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) and adding a diaphragm to the laser excitation beam, we achieve a limit of quantitation (LOQ) down to 0.1 pM, significantly below the state-of-the-art. We identify the physical parameters setting the LOQ and introduce a broadly applicable figure of merit (FoM) that determines the LOQ and allows for a clear comparison between experimental configurations. Our approach preserves the ability to monitor dynamic interactions, diffusion times, and distinguish species in complex mixtures. We illustrate this feature by measuring the biotin-streptavidin association rate constant which is highly challenging to assess quantitatively due to the strong affinity of the biotin-streptavidin interaction. These findings push the boundaries of single-molecule fluorescence detection for biosensing applications at sub-picomolar concentrations with high accuracy and simplified systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex with suppressed mode degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) enriches the family of vortex beams and exhibit unique properties. Typically, a high-order STOV with an intensity null degrades into multiple first-order STOVs embedded within a single wave packet during propagation, a phenomenon known as time diffraction or mode degradation. However, this degradation limits the applicability of STOVs in specialized fields. Therefore, the generation of mode degradation-suppressed STOVs (MDS-STOVs) is of significant for both practical applications and theoretical studies. Herein, we theoretically analyze the generation of MDS-STOVs by utilizing a conical phase to localize the energy of the STOV into a ring-shaped structure. For MDS-STOVs with large topological charges (TCs), the ring-shaped profile can be well-maintained, and the rapid expansion of the beam size with increasing TC is significantly suppressed compared to conventional STOVs. As a result, these MDS-STOVs can be regarded as quasi-perfect STOVs (QPSTOVs). Furthermore, QPSTOVs exhibit strong resistance to group delay dispersion (GDD), eliminating the need for precise dispersion control and facilitating their generation and application. This work advances our understanding of the physical properties of light carrying transverse OAM and opens up exciting avenues for the application of STOVs in diverse fields, such as optical communication and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Improving electron tomography of mesoporous silica by Ga intrusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron tomography (ET) offers nanoscale 3D characterization of mesoporous materials but is often limited by their low scattering contrast. Here, we introduce a gallium (Ga) intrusion strategy for mesoporous silica that dramatically improves imaging contrast - a key benefit that enables more accurate 3D reconstructions. By infiltrating Ga through a modified mercury intrusion porosimetry process, the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM signal is enhanced by 5 times, resulting in a 34% improvement in reconstruction resolution and a 49% enhancement in interface sharpness. In addition, the increased sample conductivity facilitates focused ion beam (FIB) milling by minimizing charging effects and reducing drift. This approach enables precise segmentation and quantitative analysis of pore connectivity and size distribution, thereby extending the applicability of ET to light-element non-conductive materials and advancing structure-property characterization of complex porous systems.</description>

      <title>Extreme electrodynamics in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abrupt time variations of the properties of optical materials have been at the center of intense research efforts in recent years, with the prospect of enabling extreme wave transformations and of leveraging time as a degree of freedom for wave control. While the most viable approach to yield ultrafast variations of the optical material response is through optical pumping of nonlinear media, the complex dynamics in these systems are not yet fully understood. Here, as a relevant case study, we rigorously investigate the pump-probe dynamics in a 310nm-thick transparent conductive oxide etalon, using a weak 40 femtosecond probe and a pump that displays peak power densities in the TW/cm^2 range with a duration of a few femtoseconds. We examine the pump-probe interaction using a hydrodynamic-Maxwell approach that accounts for diffraction, self-focusing and -defocusing, self- and cross-phase modulation, probe gain, and linear and nonlinear material dispersion expanded in the perturbative regime up to 9th order for both pump and probe. By allowing the intricacies of the pump-probe interaction to proceed in time, we can also define an effective spatio-temporal permittivity for a more direct evaluation of the material ultra-broadband optical behavior. The reported results challenge the conventional modeling of this kind of problem, which has so far overlooked pump dynamics, simplistically assigning a local time-dependent refractive index to the probe that may be designed to fit the experimental data, but has no physical connection to the complex pump-probe interaction. Our approach unveils new dynamics, pointing towards the possibility to achieve extreme pulse compression into the attosecond range and nonlinear diffraction over deeply subwavelength propagation distances, thus opening a possible new path towards novel and cost-effective tools for integrated photonics and attosecond science.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing has reemerged as a promising alternative computing paradigm for providing energy-efficient information processing in the age of artificial intelligence. Among various photonic neural network platforms, diffractive optical processing systems in free space proved high-performance computing with high parallelism. Here, we report fiber-based diffractive deep neural networks by optimizing the linear coupling of the waveguide modes. Our approach demonstrated high performance in various machine learning tasks such as biomedical disease, fashion, and geospatial classification with a simple readout layer and all-optically. Operating on linear optics, our architecture performs on par with neural networks even in complex datasets where the data cannot be separated using linear operations. These results will enable efficient and scalable diffractive information processing with waveguides for real-life computing, telecommunications, and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Pulse Compression by an Optical Push Broom On a Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report a first experimental demonstration of pulse compression by a gradual refractive index front moving in a periodically modulated silicon waveguide, the so-called optical push broom effect. Optical push broom captures and confines the input signal pulse in a faster propagating refractive index front, driven by a pump pulse. This is a spatio-temporal analogue of light trapping in a tapered plasmonic waveguide where light is continuously changing its wavevector approaching zero group velocity and, thus, stopped without reflection. Here the signal is accelerated by the front until the signal velocity matches the front velocity, thus stopping the light in respect to the front. We employ the slowly varying envelope approximation to model this phenomenon. Notably, we well reproduced the experimental frequency shift at the output corresponding to the temporal delay at the input.</description>

      <title>Partial Topological Protection in C4 Lattices for Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent studies, analogs of the electronic Quantum Spin-Hall Effect have been explored within photonic crystals that incorporate spatial symmetries, especially those with $ C_{6v} $ symmetry, where $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological invariants are enforced by crystalline symmetry. These photonic crystals possess bulk states with well-defined pseudospins and exhibit helical edge states, closely resembling their electronic counterparts. However, achieving $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological protection in a square lattice photonic crystal remains great theoretical and experimental challange. In this work, we propose a single material photonic crystal structure based on a $ C_4 $ lattice that supports partially $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $-protected edge modes. We show that this structure can host photonic band-gap that hosts $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $-like modes, enabling perfect transmission in waveguide applications. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of these modes against structural defects and directional turns, highlighting the distinctions between full $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological protection and partial topological protection. Finally, we analyze the impact of the number of elementary cells surrounding the interface on the formation and stability of these protected modes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of machine learning techniques for conditional generative adversarial networks in inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been introduced in the inverse design of physical devices, i.e., the automatic generation of device geometries for a desired physical response. In particular, generative adversarial networks have been proposed as a promising approach for topological optimization, since such neural network models can perform free-form design and simultaneously take into account constraints imposed by the device's fabrication process. In this context, a plethora of techniques has been developed in the machine learning community. Here, we study to what extent new network architectures, such as dense residual networks, and other techniques like data augmentation, and the use of noise in the input channels of the discriminator can improve or speed up neural networks for inverse design of optical metasurfaces. We also investigate strategies for improving the convergence of the training of generative adversarial networks for inverse design, e.g., temporarily freezing the discriminator weights when the model outperforms the generator and training data blurring during the early epochs. Our results show that only some of these techniques improve inverse design models in terms of accuracy and stability, but also that a combination of them can provide more efficient and robust metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable strong coupling in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface for optical modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductors exhibit tunable exciton resonances that can be harnessed for dynamic manipulation of visible light in ultra-compact metadevices. However, the rapid nonradiative decay and dephasing of excitons at room temperature limits current active excitonic metasurfaces to few-percent efficiencies. Here, we leverage the combined merits of pristine 2D heterostructures and non-local dielectric metasurfaces to enhance the excitonic light-matter interaction, achieving strong and electrically tunable exciton-photon coupling at ambient conditions in a hybrid-2D excitonic metasurface. Using this, we realize a free-space optical modulator and experimentally demonstrate 9.9 dB of reflectance modulation. The electro-optic response, characterized by a continuous transition from strong to weak coupling, is mediated by gating-induced variations in the free carrier concentration altering the exciton\`s nonradiative decay rate. These results highlight how hybrid-2D excitonic metasurfaces offer novel opportunities to realize nanophotonic devices for active wavefront manipulation and optical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing new materials as alternative to silicon for application in photonic devices has been the center of attention in the scientific community. Two-Dimensional (2D) materials have shown a great capacity to be next alternative to remedy this impediment. Graphene due to its unique properties such as high mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability is amongst 2D materials to shine in photonics and optoelectronics. Several graphene-based photodetectors with ability to integrate with various energy thermoelectric, electromagnetic and piezoelectric devices is reported. However, pristine graphene is not suitable to detect reasonable signals in infrared region, due to its bandgap limitation. In this work, a graphene based near infrared detection is demonstrated using graphene/metal intercalated graphene photodetector. The intercalated graphene was grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu substrate and wet transfer of the layers to the Si/SiO2 substrate. A tapered aluminum microelectrode has been used for the electrical contacts to improve the detection of photogenerated carriers during the illumination. The infrared detection was demonstrated, responsivity and quantum efficiency was tested at room temperature and the mechanism of photogeneration was explained.</description>

      <title>Optomechanically induced transparency in Four-wave mixing atomic ensemble assisted Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state optical response of a Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system integrated with cold atoms featuring a double-$\Lambda$ energy level structure. Within this hybrid system, the atoms are driven by cavity mode and three coherent vortex beams, each carrying independent orbital angular momentum (OAM). We first check the steady-state output spectrum of the hybrid system in the passive/active case (without/with external cavity driving). Our findings reveal that the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum is modulated by the OAM difference $(\Delta \ell\hbar)$ from the atomic component throughout the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The resulting loop phase ($\Delta \ell\theta$) can achieve a switching effect on the absorption and gain behavior of the hybrid system for the probe beam. Additionally, the group delay, indicative of fast/slow light phenomena, is also tuned by $\Delta \ell$. We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the periodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system. This research provides valuable insights into the modulation of optical responses in Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Strain engineering of valley-polarized hybrid excitons in a 2D semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding and manipulating digital information in quantum degrees of freedom is one of the major challenges of today's science and technology. The valley indices of excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are well-suited to address this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new class of strain-tunable, valley-polarized hybrid excitons in monolayer TMDs, comprising a pair of energy-resonant intra- and intervalley excitons. These states combine the advantages of bright intravalley excitons, where the valley index directly couples to light polarization, and dark intervalley excitons, characterized by low depolarization rates. We demonstrate that the hybridized state of dark KK' intervalley and defect-localized excitons exhibits a degree of circular polarization of emitted photons that is three times higher than that of the constituent species. Moreover, a bright KK intravalley and a dark KQ exciton form a coherently coupled hybrid state under energetic resonance, with their valley depolarization dynamics slowed down a hundredfold. Overall, these valley-polarized hybrid excitons with strain-tunable valley character emerge as prime candidates for valleytronic applications in future quantum and information technology.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Single-Photon Adder and Subtractor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon addition and subtraction are fundamental operations in quantum information processing. Traditionally, the behavior of a single-photon adder (SPA) and single-photon subtractor (SPS) has been theoretically described using creation and annihilation operators, respectively. However, we demonstrate that this ladder-operator-based description contains significant theoretical flaws. To address these issues, we develop a theoretical framework based on Kraus operators, applicable to both coherent and incoherent SPAs and SPSs. Furthermore, we propose a method for realizing deterministic SPAs and SPSs of a cavity mode using three-level atoms. We analyze the effects of these operations on various quantum states. Additionally, we demonstrate that the use of a control pulse could enhance the performance of SPAs and SPSs, effectively preserving the quantum coherence of the resulting photon state.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <title>In-situ Doppler-free spectroscopy with pulsed optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel pulsed optical field method that alternately switches the pump beam in conventional saturation absorption to time-division multiplex the same probe beam into both probe and reference beams, followed by digital differential processing to achieve deterministic zero-background Doppler-free spectroscopy. This method effectively mitigates Doppler broadening and common-mode optical noise by addressing disturbances such as non-uniform background absorption and environmental noise, thereby offering enhanced accuracy and robustness. Using this technique, we measured the absolute frequency of Yb$^{+}$ isotopes in the $6s^2\ ^{1}S_0\to 6s6p ^{1}P_1$ transition. By employing an error signal derived from the first-derivative demodulated spectrum of $^{174}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$, we achieved efficient stabilization of a 369.5 nm ultraviolet diode laser, demonstrating a frequency stability of $3 \times 10^{-11}$ over a 1500-second averaging period and a locking point uncertainty of 850 kHz sustained over 10 days. Furthermore, we report the first in-situ observation of Doppler-free Zeeman sub-level spectra, highlighting the precision of this method and its potential application in measuring magnetic field gradients.</description>

      <title>Polarizations Underdescribe Vectorial Electromagnetic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves are described by not only polarization ellipses but also cyclically rotating vectors tracing out them. The corresponding fields are respectively directionless steady line fields and directional instantaneous vector fields. Here we study the seminal topic of electromagnetic scattering from the perspective of instantaneous vector fields and uncover how the global topology of the momentum sphere regulates local distributions of tangent scattered fields. Structurally-stable generic singularities of vector fields move cyclically along lines of linear polarizations and at any instant the index sum of all instantaneous singularities has to be the Euler characteristic $\chi=2$. This contrasts sharply with steady line fields, of which generic singularities constrained by the Euler characteristic locate on points of circular polarizations. From such unique perspective of instantaneous singularities, we discovered that for circularly-polarized waves scattered by electromagnetic duality-symmetric particles, since linearly-polarized scatterings are prohibited by helicity conservation, there must exist at least one dark direction along which the scattering is strictly zero. Two such dark directions can be tuned to overlap, along which the scattering would remain zero for arbitrary incident polarizations. We have essentially revealed that \textit{polarizations underdescribe vectorial electromagnetic waves and the instantaneous perspective is indispensable}. The complementarity we discover provides broader and deeper insights into not only electromagnetism, but also other branches of wave physics where singularities are generic and ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>T-matrix representation of optical scattering response: Suggestion for a data format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition matrix, frequently abbreviated as T-matrix, contains the complete information in a linear approximation of how a spatially localized object scatters an incident field. The T-matrix is used to study the scattering response of an isolated object and describes the optical response of complex photonic materials made from ensembles of individual objects. T-matrices of certain common structures, potentially, have been repeatedly calculated all over the world again and again. This is not necessary and constitutes a major challenge for various reasons. First, the resources spent on their computation represent an unsustainable financial and ecological burden. Second, with the onset of machine learning, data is the gold of our era, and it should be freely available to everybody to address novel scientific challenges. Finally, the possibility of reproducing simulations could tremendously improve if the considered T-matrices could be shared. To address these challenges, we found it important to agree on a common data format for T-matrices and to enable their collection from different sources and distribution. This document aims to develop the specifications for storing T-matrices and associated metadata. The specifications should allow maximum freedom to accommodate as many use cases as possible without introducing any ambiguity in the stored data. The common format will assist in setting up a public database of T-matrices.</description>

      <title>Large Bidirectional Refractive Index Change in Silicon-rich Nitride via Visible Light Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices are highly susceptible to minor manufacturing deviations, resulting in significant performance inconsistencies. This variability has limited the scalability and widespread adoption of these devices. Here, a major advancement is achieved through continuous-wave (CW) visible light (405 nm and 520 nm) trimming of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguides. The demonstrated method achieves precise, bidirectional refractive index tuning with a single laser source in CMOS-compatible SRN samples with refractive indices of 2.4 and 2.9 (measured at 1550 nm). By utilizing a cost-effective setup for real-time resonance tracking in micro-ring resonators, the resonant wavelength shifts as fine as 10 pm are attained. Additionally, a record red shift of 49.1 nm and a substantial blue shift of 10.6 nm are demonstrated, corresponding to refractive index changes of approximately 0.11 and -0.02. The blue and red shifts are both conclusively attributed to thermal annealing. These results highlight SRN's exceptional capability for permanent optical tuning, establishing a foundation for stable, precisely controlled performance in phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable metasurfaces have been extensively studied to enhance system capacity in response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information. Among them, the mechanically reconfigurable strategy offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization methods. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces. We utilized the deep diffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>Optical Quasiparticles: Skyrmions, Bimerons and Skyrmionic Hopfions in Paraxial Laser Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions, merons, bimerons, and skyrmionic hopfions are quasiparticles which have stable topological textures. They have been observed across multiple physical domains including nucleons, water waves, magnetic materials, electromagnetic fields, condensed-matter physics, liquid crystals, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The nontrivial topological texture of these quasiparticles exhibited promising applications across several research fields including cosmology, particle physics, superfluids, high-energy physics, optics, condensed matter, early-universe cosmology, cold quantum matter, and liquid crystals. These quasiparticles have most recently been observed in paraxial vector beams. Due to the inhomogeneous polarization distribution of vector beams, the quasiparticle textures reside in the Stokes vector fields. Here, we review recent developments in paraxial quasiparticle research and provide detailed information on their fundamental properties and future prospects. We discuss various techniques which have been used to experimentally generate these quasiparticles and we examine a number of their proposed applications. Notably, this review offers insight into the concepts and techniques which can be applied to the generation of optical skyrmions in paraxial laser beams, and investigates their intriguing applications across both fundamental and applied optics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation from a microwave field to a solid-state magnon mode. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference of Photons from Remote Tin-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks rely on optical connections between long-lived qubits to distribute entanglement. Tin vacancies in diamond have emerged as promising long-lived qubits, offering extended spin coherence times at liquid helium temperatures and spin-dependent, highly coherent optical transitions for effective photon-based communication. Connecting remote nodes requires quantum interference of indistinguishable photons, which is challenging in an inhomogeneous solid-state environment. Here, we demonstrate a two-node experiment with tin vacancies in diamond, which exhibit a resonant frequency distribution spanning approximately 8 GHz. To overcome the frequency mismatch, we tune the resonant frequencies of one node using the Stark effect. We achieve tunability up to 4 GHz while maintaining optical coherence. As a demonstration, we achieve detuning-dependent remote two-photon interference between separate nodes, obtaining 80(6)% interference visibility without postprocessing when the defects' optical transitions are tuned into resonance, and 63(8)% with detuning up to 20 times their natural linewidths. These results highlight the potential of tin-vacancy centres in diamond for establishing robust optical links between remote quantum registers.</description>
