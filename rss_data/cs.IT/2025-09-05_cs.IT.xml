      <title>Distributed MIMO With Over-the-Air Phase Calibration Integrated Into the TDD Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity-based, joint coherent downlink beamforming from multiple access points (APs) in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with independent local oscillators (LOs) requires the APs to be periodically phase-calibrated (a.k.a. phase-synchronized or phase-aligned). Such phase alignment can be accomplished by bidirectional over-the-air measurements between the APs. In this paper, we show how such over-the-air measurements can be integrated into the time-division duplexing (TDD) flow by appropriately shifting the uplink/downlink switching points of the TDD slot structure, creating short time segments during which APs can measure on one another. We also show how this technique scales to large networks. Furthermore, we analytically characterize the tradeoff between the amount of resources spent on calibration measurements and the resulting spectral efficiency of the system, when conjugate beamforming or zero-forcing beamforming is used. The results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed MIMO with phase-calibration through over-the-air inter-AP measurements integrated into the TDD flow.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Sum-Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna Enhanced Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a novel movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink system designed to improve wireless communication performance. We aim to maximize the average achievable sum rate through two-timescale optimization exploiting instantaneous channel state information at the receiver (I-CSIR) for receive antenna position vector (APV) design and statistical channel state information at the transmitter (S-CSIT) for transmit APV and covariance matrix design. We first decompose the resulting stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term problems and one long-term problem. Then, a gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to obtain suboptimal receive APVs for the short-term problems for given I-CSIR samples. Based on the output of the gradient ascent algorithm, a series of convex objective/feasibility surrogates for the long-term problem are constructed and solved utilizing the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a planar movement mode for the receive MAs to facilitate efficient antenna movement and the development of a low-complexity primal-dual decomposition-based stochastic successive convex approximation (PDD-SSCA) algorithm, which finds Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions almost surely. Our numerical results reveal that, for both the general and the planar movement modes, the proposed two-timescale MA-enhanced system design significantly improves the average achievable sum rate and the feasibility of the formulated problem compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Design of RIS-UAV-Assisted LEO Satellite Constellation Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations play a pivotal role in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks by providing global coverage, massive connections, and huge capacity. In this paper, we present a novel LEO satellite constellation communication framework, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (RIS-UAV) is deployed to improve the communication quality of multiple terrestrial user equipments (UEs) under the condition of long distance between satellite and ground. To reduce the overhead for channel state information (CSI) acquisition with multiple-satellite collaboration, statistical CSI (sCSI) is utilized in the system. In such a situation, we first derive an approximated but exact expression for ergodic rate of each UE. Then, we aim to maximize the minimum approximated UE ergodic rate by the proposed alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes LEO satellite beamforming, RIS phase shift, and UAV trajectory. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of spectrum efficiency over baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Reed-Solomon Type MDS Codes from Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new family of MDS codes derived from elliptic curves. These codes attain lengths close to the theoretical maximum and are provably inequivalent to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Unlike many previous constructions that rely on the point at infinity, our approach allows for more general choices: we consider divisors supported on affine points and divisors consisting of multiple distinct points. This broader framework enables the construction of codes with length approximately $(q + 1 + \lfloor 2\sqrt{q} \rfloor)/2$, further illustrating the tightness of known upper bounds on elliptic MDS code lengths. A detailed comparison shows that our codes are not covered by earlier results. Moreover, we show that their inequivalence to RS codes by explicitly computing the rank of the Schur product of their generator matrices.</description>

      <title>Insights from Gradient Dynamics: Gradient Autoscaled Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification, stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide insights for future optimization research.</description>

      <title>Natural Latents: Latent Variables Stable Across Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but may have different generative models containing different latent variables. Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to approximation error in the natural latent conditions.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Counterfactual Labels for Efficient Conformal Counterfactual Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI (SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all settings.</description>

      <title>Linearity of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-Linear Codes via Schur Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12291v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative approach to investigating the linearity of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes derived from $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes using the generalized Gray map. To achieve this, we define two related binary codes: the associated and the decomposition codes. By considering the Schur product between codewords, we can determine the linearity of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code. As a result, we establish a connection between the linearity of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes with the linearity of the decomposition code for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_8$-additive codes. Furthermore, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes from nested binary codes, resulting in linear $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes. This construction involves multiple layers of binary codes, where a code in one layer is the square of the code in the previous layer. We also present a sufficient condition that allows checking nonlinearity of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes by simple binary operations in their respective associated codes. Finally, we employ our arguments to verify the linearity of well-known $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code constructions, including the Hadamard, simplex, and MacDonald codes.</description>

      <title>A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition code, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper when decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper's reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping. The implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/1weixuanchen/ A-Superposition-Code-Based-Semantic-Communication.</description>

      <title>Information Age and Correctness for Energy Harvesting Devices with Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate accuracy and freshness of status updates from a large number of energy-harvesting devices that monitor two-state Markov processes and access the medium using the slotted ALOHA protocol without feedback. Using a Markovian framework, we analyze the average value of a generic state-dependent penalty function that grows whenever there is a state estimation error. The age of incorrect information (AoII) is an example of such penalty function. We propose an accurate and easy-to-compute approximation for the average penalty. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of optimizing the transmission probabilities according to the process state transitions and current battery levels to minimize the average penalty. Minimizing a state-independent penalty function can be highly suboptimal in terms of average penalty when one of the process states is critical, i.e., entails a high penalty if wrongly estimated. Furthermore, minimizing the average penalty does not guarantee a low probability of misdetecting a critical state period.</description>

      <title>Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Rate-Reward Trade-off in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of communication on decision-making systems has been extensively studied under the assumption of dedicated communication channels. We instead consider communicating through actions, where the message is embedded into the actions of an agent which interacts with the environment in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We conceptualize the MDP environment as a finite-state channel (FSC), where the actions of the agent serve as the channel input, while the states of the MDP observed by another agent (i.e., receiver) serve as the channel output. Here, we treat the environment as a communication channel over which the agent communicates through its actions, while at the same time, trying to maximize its reward. We first characterize the optimal information theoretic trade-off between the average reward and the rate of reliable communication in the infinite-horizon regime. Then, we propose a novel framework to design a joint control/coding policy, termed \textit{Act2Comm}, which seamlessly embeds messages into actions. From a communication perspective, \textit{Act2Comm} functions as a learning-based channel coding scheme for non-differentiable FSCs under input-output constraints. From a control standpoint, \textit{Act2Comm} learns an MDP policy that incorporates communication capabilities, though at the cost of some control performance. Overall, \textit{Act2Comm} effectively balances the dual objectives of control and communication in this environment. Experimental results validate \textit{Act2Comm}'s capability to enable reliable communication while maintaining a certain level of control performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires measurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We present a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze its impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with independent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to accommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the phase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of the interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with low-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking substantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large compared to LOs phase drifts.</description>

      <title>Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain stability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge-potentially part of the training set of the SemCom system-between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding with the index of Y2 shared, while the eavesdropper' s decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication and Sensing: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) is an emerging technology that offers significant potential to enhance wireless communication and sensing performance by flexibly adjusting the boresight of directional antennas. Specifically, RA can flexibly reconfigure its boresight direction via mechanical or electronic means, thereby improving communication channel conditions and/or enhancing sensing resolution and range. In this article, we first provide an overview of RA, covering its hardware architectures and radiation pattern characterization. We then illustrate how RA improves communication performance through interference mitigation, spatial multiplexing, and flexible beamforming, as well as sensing capabilities in terms of coverage, resolution, and multi-target/dimensional sensing. Furthermore, we highlight representative applications of RA and discuss key design challenges in RA systems, including rotational scanning scheduling, channel estimation/sensing, boresight optimization, and RA configuration. Finally, both experimental and simulation results are provided to validate the performance gains achieved by RA for both communication and sensing. Leveraging its unique capabilities in flexible antenna/array rotation to adapt to various communication/sensing requirements and channel conditions, RA is poised to become a key enabler of future intelligent, resilient, and agile wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Selective Modeling and Analysis for OFDM-Integrated Wideband Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates the integration of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to ensure their compatibility and to explore the frequency-selective behavior inherent to PASS. First, an end-to-end channel model for OFDM PASS is proposed based on electromagnetic-compliant modeling of waveguides and coupled-mode theory, which includes frequency-dependent waveguide attenuation, dispersion and antenna coupling effect. Furthermore, a critical dependence of the OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) overhead on the proximity of the operating frequency to the waveguide cutoff is revealed. Moreover, the phase misalignment effect across subcarriers in OFDM PASS is derived for an approximate pinching antenna location strategy based on path loss minimization, which reveals the phase misalignment is exacerbated for wider bandwidths and larger array size. Numerical results show that: 1) frequency-selective effects in OFDM PASS lead to substantial variations in subcarrier achievable rates, highlighting the necessity of operating above the waveguide cutoff frequency for effective communications; 2) waveguide dispersion mandates considerable CP overhead when operating near the cutoff frequency, severely impacting the spectral efficiency of OFDM PASS; and 3) the gentle linear waveguide attenuation in a practical PASS significantly more advantageous than the severe logarithmic path loss characteristic of fixed-location antennas.</description>

      <title>MichelangeRoll: Sculpting Rational Distributions Exactly and Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating an arbitrary discrete distribution $D \in [0, 1]^n$ using fair coin tosses incurs trade-offs between entropy complexity and space and time complexity. Shannon's theory suggests that $H(D)$ tosses are necessary and sufficient, but does not guarantee exact distribution. Knuth and Yao showed that a decision tree consumes fewer than $H(D) + 2$ tosses for one exact sample. Draper and Saad's recent work addresses the space and time aspect, showing that $H(D) + 2$ tosses, $O(n \log(n) \log(m))$ memory, and $O(H(D))$ operations are all it costs, where $m$ is the common denominator of the probability masses in $D$ and $n$ is the number of possible outcomes.
  In this paper, MichelangeRoll recycles leftover entropy to break the "$+2$" barrier. With $O((n + 1/\varepsilon) \log(m/\varepsilon))$ memory, the entropy cost of generating a ongoing sequence of $D$ is reduced to $H(D) + \varepsilon$ per sample.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Flatness Factor over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice is a power series that characterizes the number of lattice vectors at certain norms. It is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices. In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. This result advances the resolution of the open question, suggesting that any unimodular lattice, except those isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the theta series ratio. Consequently, all the findings concerning the theta series of a lattice extend to its flatness factor. Therefore, our results have applications to the Gaussian wiretap channel, the reverse Minkowski theorem, and lattice-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>LotteryCodec: Searching the Implicit Representation in a Random Network for Low-Complexity Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate the lottery codec hypothesis, which states that untrained subnetworks within randomly initialized networks can serve as synthesis networks for overfitted image compression, achieving rate-distortion (RD) performance comparable to trained networks. This hypothesis leads to a new paradigm for image compression by encoding image statistics into the network substructure. Building on this hypothesis, we propose LotteryCodec, which overfits a binary mask to an individual image, leveraging an over-parameterized and randomly initialized network shared by the encoder and the decoder. To address over-parameterization challenges and streamline subnetwork search, we develop a rewind modulation mechanism that improves the RD performance. LotteryCodec outperforms VTM and sets a new state-of-the-art in single-image compression. LotteryCodec also enables adaptive decoding complexity through adjustable mask ratios, offering flexible compression solutions for diverse device constraints and application requirements.</description>
