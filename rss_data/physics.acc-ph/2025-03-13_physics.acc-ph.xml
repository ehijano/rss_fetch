      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Accelerate 3D Coherent Synchrotron Radiation Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the effects of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) is one of the most computationally expensive tasks in accelerator physics. Here, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN's), along with a latent conditional diffusion (LCD) model, trained on physics-based simulations to speed up calculations. Specifically, we produce the 3D CSR wakefields generated by electron bunches in circular orbit in the steady-state condition. Two datasets are used for training and testing the models: wakefields generated by three-dimensional Gaussian electron distributions and wakefields from a sum of up to 25 three-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The CNN's are able to accurately produce the 3D wakefields $\sim 250-1000$ times faster than the numerical calculations, while the LCD has a gain of a factor of $\sim 34$. We also test the extrapolation and out-of-distribution generalization ability of the models. They generalize well on distributions with larger spreads than what they were trained on, but struggle with smaller spreads.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>Short-Pulse Driven Radiofrequency X-Band Photoinjector: Electromagnetic Properties and Beam Dynamics in the Transient Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09575v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics and beam dynamics of an X-band photogun (Xgun) operating in the transient state. The photoinjector is designed to operate with short RF pulses (9 ns) to achieve high accelerating gradients. Short-pulse operation potentially reduces breakdown risks, as experimentally demonstrated by achieving a gradient exceeding 350 MV/m. However, the short pulse duration causes the cavity to operate in a transient regime where the electromagnetic field deviates from the conventional steady-state condition. To investigate the effects of deviations from steady-state operation, the time-dependent spatial evolution of the cavity fields was examined using both 9-ns and 50-ns RF pulses. The 50-ns pulse served as a reference to characterize the cavity behavior under a fully filled steady-state condition. Beam dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the impact of transient RF effects on beam kinetic energy, transverse emittance, and bunch length; these simulations employed a new dynamic field mapping approach to model transient RF fields.</description>

      <title>Advanced muon-spin spectroscopy with high lateral resolution using Si-pixel detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon-spin spectroscopy at continuous sources has stagnated at a stopped muons rate of ~40 kHz for the last few decades. The major limiting factor is the requirement of a single muon in the sample during the typical 10 {\mu}s data gate window. To overcome this limit and to be able to perform muon-spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements on millimeter-sized samples, one can use vertex reconstruction methods to construct {\mu}SR spectra. This is now possible thanks to the availability of very thin monolithic Si-pixel chips, which offer minimal particle scattering and high count rate. Here we present results from a Si-pixel based spectrometer that utilizes vertex reconstruction schemes for the incoming muons and emitted positrons. With this spectrometer we were able to obtain a first vertex reconstructed {\mu}SR (VR-{\mu}SR) spectrum. The unique capabilities and benefits of such a spectrometer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the Erice Workshop: A new baseline for the hybrid, asymmetric, linear Higgs factory HALHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HALHF collaboration has discussed a new baseline for the project, taking into account comments from the accelerator community on various aspects of the original design. In particular, these concerned the practicality of the dual-purpose linac to accelerate both colliding positron bunches and the drive beams required for the plasma linac. In addition, many other aspects of the project were also considered; the discussion and conclusions are documented in this paper. Finally, a new baseline is outlined that has been optimised and addresses several weaknesses in the original design, has higher luminosity, reduced centre-of-mass energy boost and additional features such as positron polarization as well as electron polarization. Although HALHF has become longer and more expensive, it remains significantly smaller and cheaper than other mature Higgs factory designs currently under discussion.</description>
