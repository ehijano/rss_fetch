      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical gate distance for Wigner crystallization in the two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a dual-gate geometry, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to obtain aspects of the phase diagram as a function of electron density and gate distance. We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Landau levels and quantum oscillation in rotation-invariant insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau levels in certain models are known to protrude into the zero-field energy gap. These are known as anomalous Landau levels (ALLs). We study whether ALLs can lead to in-gap quantum oscillation in the absence of a zero-field Fermi surface. Focusing on two-dimensional multi-band low-energy models of electrons with continuous rotation symmetry, we show that an effective-band description, akin to the semiclassical treatment of Landau level problems in metals, can be used to predict the Landau level spectrum, including possible ALLs. This description then predicts quantum oscillation for certain insulating models, which we demonstrate through numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical approach for computing and analyzing two-dimensional spectroscopy of bosonic collective excitations in disordered many-body systems. Specifically, we employ the Keldysh formalism to derive the nonlinear response and obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy maps with particular emphasis on the rephasing sector, which allows to disentangle different sources of broadening. Our many-body approach successfully distinguishes elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms contributing to the excitation linewidth. Additionally, using a non-perturbative conserving approach, we demonstrate that the echo peak exhibits a universal asymmetric shape in the sole presence of static disorder, a feature that remains robust against quantum fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the standard theory based on isolated two-level systems, which fails to account for the dispersive nature of excitations and the interactions between different momentum components.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning semi-local exchange-correlation functionals for Kohn-Sham density functional theory of the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model provides a test bed to investigate the complex behaviour arising from electron-electron interaction in strongly-correlated systems and naturally emerges as the foundation model for lattice density functional theory (DFT). Similarly to conventional DFT, lattice DFT computes the ground-state energy of a given Hubbard model, by minimising a universal energy functional of the on-site occupations. Here we use machine learning to construct a class of scalable `semi-local' exchange-correlation functionals with an arbitrary degree of non-locality for the one-dimensional spinfull Hubbard model. Then, by functional derivative we construct an associated Kohn-Sham potential, that is used to solve the associated Kohn-Sham equations. After having investigated how the accuracy of the semi-local approximation depends on the degree of non-locality, we use our Kohn-Sham scheme to compute the polarizability of linear chains, either homogeneous or disordered, approaching the thermodynamic limit. approaching the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>The spin-orbital Kitaev model: from kagome spin ice to classical fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable spin-orbital model that can be regarded as a classical analogue of the celebrated Kitaev honeycomb model and describes interactions between Rydberg atoms on the ruby lattice. We leverage its local and nonlocal symmetries to determine the exact partition function and the static structure factor. A mapping between $S=3/2$ models on the honeycomb lattice and kagome spin Hamiltonians allows us to interpret the thermodynamic properties in terms of a classical kagome spin ice. Partially lifting the symmetries associated with line operators, we obtain a model characterized by immobile excitations, called classical fractons, and a ground state degeneracy that increases exponentially with the length of the system. We formulate a continuum theory that reveals the underlying gauge structure and conserved charges. Extensions of our theory to other lattices and higher-spin systems are suggested.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature magnetic behaviour on the triangular lattice in hexagonal Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal polymorph of Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$ contains Tb$^{3+}$ ions on a quasi-2D triangular lattice, resulting in geometric magnetic frustration. Powder samples of Ba$_3$Tb(BO$_3$)$_3$ have been investigated using specific heat, powder neutron diffraction (PND), inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon-spin relaxation spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). No long-range magnetic ordering is observed down to the lowest measured temperatures of 75 mK in PND and specific heat data and 1.5 K in the $\mu$SR data. Modelling the INS spectrum using a point charge model suggests that the ground state is a singlet with a low-lying doublet on each of the two crystallographically independent Tb$^{3+}$ sites and that both the Tb ions display weak XY single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present new methods for critical analysis to determine the range of exchange interaction(s) and appropriate values of critical exponents for different magnetic systems. From computational and experimental investigations of magnetic behavior of Ni and Gd, we show that the critical behavior remains the same on either side of transition temperature. Using our proposed method of analysis for Gd, we find a critical role of competing interactions where the local electron moments follow 3D Ising type short-range interactions whereas the itinerant electron moments constitute mean-field type long-range RKKY interaction.</description>

      <title>Separate surface and bulk topological Anderson localization transitions in disordered axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In topological phases of matter for which the bulk and boundary support distinct electronic gaps, there exists the possibility of decoupled mobility gaps in the presence of disorder. This is in analogy with the well-studied problem of realizing separate or concomitant bulk-boundary criticality in conventional Landau theory. Using a three-dimensional axion insulator having clean, gapped surfaces with $e^2/2h$ quantized Hall conductance, we show the bulk and surface mobility gap evolve differently in the presence of disorder. The decoupling of the bulk and surface topology yields a regime that realizes a two-dimensional, unquantized anomalous Hall metal in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which shares some spectral and response properties akin to the surface states of a conventional three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator. The generality of these results as well as extensions to other insulators and superconductors is discussed.</description>

      <title>Viewing fluxonium through the lens of the cat qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic behavior of generic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the vicinity of phase-separated regions is known to produce an instability where well-known relativistic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) techniques fail. In this letter, we introduce an analytic paradigm which solves this important issue. We show that there is an emergent Carrollian symmetry when phase separation is reached and techniques of Carroll CFT, as opposed to its relativistic relative, is central to the understanding of the physics. We work with the analogous spinless fermionic system in this region and capture the transition across this phase separation. Our numerical results corroborate the density-density correlations intrinsically computed using Carroll CFT.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Phase Diagram of Monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) and fluctuations around it are believed to be important for understanding the phase diagram in unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, iron pnictides, and heavy fermion superconductors. However, the QCP is usually buried deep within the superconducting dome and is difficult to investigate. The connection between quantum critical fluctuations and superconductivity remains an outstanding problem in condensed matter. Here combining both electrical transport and Nernst experiments, we explicitly demonstrate the onset of superconductivity at an unconventional QCP in gate-tuned monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), with features incompatible with the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) scenario. The results lead to a novel superconducting phase diagram that is distinguished from other known superconductors. Two distinct gate-tuned quantum phase transitions are observed at the ends of the superconducting dome. We find that quantum fluctuations around the QCP of the underdoped regime are essential for understanding how the monolayer superconductivity is established. The unconventional phase diagram we report here illustrates a previously unknown relation between superconductivity and QCP.</description>

      <title>A sturdy spin-momentum locking in a chiral organic superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among noncentrosymmetric structures, chirality has recently been recognized as a novel source of asymmetrical charge/spin transports as exemplified by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMChA) and chirality-induced spin selectivity. Although similar bulk-charge rectification and Rashba-Edelstein effect in polar systems are quantitively reproducible by theory based on the electronic band structures, the relevance of band parameters in chiral effects remains elusive. Here, by working with a chiral organic superconductor, we experimentally demonstrate a gigantic EMChA and large superconducting diode effect, both of which are difficult to be explained solely by its band parameters. A two-critical-current signature and an enhanced critical field suggested triplet-mixed Cooper pairs with anomalously enhanced spin-orbit coupling above atomic limit. Our results clearly highlight a unique spin-momentum locking with large stiffness beyond the expectation, suggesting an unknown driving force for spin polarization inherent to chirality.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>MPS Stability and the Intersection Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a property of the local tensors of matrix product states (MPS) that guarantees that their parent Hamiltonians satisfy the intersection property. The intersection property ensures that the ground space consists of MPS, with degeneracy bounded by the square of the bond dimension. The new local property, dubbed stability, generalizes (block) injectivity and is satisfied by the MPS tensors that construct the W state, domain wall superposition states, and their generalizations.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Hopping between Surface Mott Insulator and Bulk Band Insulator in layered 1T-TaS_{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, various mechanisms give rise to distinct insulating phases. The competition and interplay between these phases remain elusive, even for the seemingly most distinguishable band and Mott insulators. In multilayer systems, such interplay is mediated by interlayer hopping, which competes with the Coulomb repulsion to determine the nature of insulators. The layered compound 1T-TaS_{2} provides an ideal platform for investigating this phenomenon, as it naturally hosts coexisting Mott and band insulating states. However, distinguishing these distinct insulating states and characterizing the evolution remain challenging. In this study, we employ a dual approach utilizing surface-sensitive High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and bulk-sensitive Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the electronic excitation spectrum of 1T-TaS_{2}. Our methodology effectively identifies the features originating from the Mott and band insulators by analyzing the differences in their bulk and surface spectral weights, along with their energy distinctions. Based on the previous identification, we further investigate the evolution of insulating state features in the homostructure as they are modulated by temperature. The measurements and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations suggest that the softening and broadening of Hubbard excitations in the Mott state with increasing temperature result from enhanced interlayer hopping between the Mott and band insulators.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Why Charge Added Using Transition Metals To Some Insulators -- Including LK-99 -- Localizes and Does Not Yield a Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While adding charge to semiconductors via dopants is a well-established method for tuning electronic properties, we demonstrate that introducing transition metal impurities into certain insulators can lead to localized charge, assisted by a Jahn-Teller distortion. This leads to isolated charge, and an insulating material as opposed to emergent states - including superconductivity. We focus on Cu impurities added to Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ('LK-99'), replacing 10% of Cu ions, as discussed in recent literature. Our calculations show that the material remains a wide bandgap insulator with isolated, S=1/2 localized charges on the Cu ions-similar to color centers-even within standard DFT, without the need for electron correlation corrections to the Cu d-orbitals. Superconductivity is excluded by known mechanisms that require the material to be metallic. We resolve previously observed inconsistencies between density functional theory results and experimental findings related to doping site energetics, crystal structure, and transparency. We find that Cu doping either Pb site leads to CuO$_4$ coordination and a similar unit cell volume contraction. Engineering materials with dopant sites that have different local symmetries can induce non-relativistic spin splitting-often referred to as altermagnetism. However, in the case of localized charges, this may enable spins to be individually controlled.</description>

      <title>Dynamical deconfinement transition driven by density of excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the deconfinement transition driven by excitations in long-range spin models. At low temperatures, these models exhibit a confined phase where domain-wall (or kinks) are localized. As temperature increases, kinks interact and propagate, leading to a transition to a de-confined phase. This transition is influenced by the interplay between thermal energy and interaction effects, resulting in extended, de-confined regions. Although kinks density is dynamically stable, non-equilibrium changes in their fluctuations characterize the transition. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of confinement and deconfinement in long-range spin models, with implications for both condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories. Bridging these fields, this study sheds light on the universal aspects of confinement and opens avenues for further exploration and experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Theory of Correlated Insulator(s) and Superconductor at $\nu=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</description>

      <title>A Field Guide to non-Onsager Quantum Oscillations in Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum oscillation (QO) measurements constitute a powerful method to measure the Fermi surface (FS) properties of metals. The observation of QOs is usually taken as strong evidence for the existence of extremal cross-sectional areas of the FS according to the famous Onsager relation. Here, we review mechanisms that generate QO frequencies that defy the Onsager relation and discuss material candidates. These include magnetic breakdown, magnetic interaction, chemical potential oscillations, and Stark quantum interference, most of which lead to signals occurring at combinations of ``parent'' Onsager frequencies. A special emphasis is put on the recently discovered mechanism of quasi-particle lifetime oscillations (QPLOs). We aim to provide a field guide that allows, on the one hand, to distinguish such non-Onsager QOs from conventional QOs arising from extremal cross sections and, on the other hand, to distinguish the various non-Onsager mechanisms from each other. We give a practical classification of non-Onsager QOs in terms of the prerequisites for their occurrence and their characteristics. We show that, in particular, the recently discovered QPLOs may pose significant challenges for the interpretation of QO spectra, as they may occur quite generically as frequency differences in multi-orbit systems, \emph{without} the necessity of visible ``parent'' frequencies in the spectrum, owing to a strongly suppressed temperature dephasing of QPLOs. We present an extensive list of material candidates where QPLOs may represent an alternative explanation for the observation of unexpected QO frequencies.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase and Quantum Oscillation from Multi-orbital Coadjoint-orbit Bosonization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an effective field theory for a multi-orbital fermionic system using the method of coadjoint orbits for higher-dimensional bosonization. The dynamical bosonic fields are single-particle distribution functions defined on the phase space. We show that when projecting to a single band, Berry curvature effects naturally emerge. In particular, we consider the de Haas-van Alphen effect of a 2d Fermi surface, and show that the oscillation of orbital magnetization in an external field is offset by the Berry phase accumulated by the cyclotron around the Fermi surface. Beyond previously known results, we show that this phase shift holds even for interacting systems, in which the single-particle Berry phase is replaced by the static anomalous Hall conductance. Furthermore, we obtain the correction to the amplitudes of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations due to Berry curvature effects.</description>

      <title>Effects of electron correlation on resonant Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to the Edelstein effect, which is the induced spin polarization in response to an applied electric field or current, and the inverse Edelstein effect, which is the induced electric current in response to an oscillatory magnetic field or spin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of spin-chiral collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We also study the spectral weight distribution between the two resonances over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions.</description>

      <title>Sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting in the nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating finite-temperature quantum many-body systems, based on the minimization of a modified free energy. This approach directly approximates the state at a fixed temperature, allowing for systematic improvement of the ansatz expressiveness without accumulating errors from iterative imaginary time evolution. We employ a variety of trial states -- both tensor networks as well as neural networks -- as variational Ans\"atze for our numerical optimization. We benchmark and compare different constructions in the above classes, both for one- and two-dimensional problems, with systems made of up to $N=100$ spins. Our results demonstrate that while restricted Boltzmann machines show limitations, string bond tensor network states exhibit systematic improvements with increasing bond dimensions and the number of strings.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>
