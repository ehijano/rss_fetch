      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>Splitting dynamics of quantized composite vortices in holographic miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability properties and splitting dynamics of multiply quantized vortices are the subject of interest in both theoretical and experimental investigations. Going beyond the regime of validity of Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we study the composite vortices in miscible strongly interacting binary superfluids by employing a holographic model that naturally incorporate finite temperature and dissipation. The composite vortices is classified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers and can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or counter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical transitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting behaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving the full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices. We find that the final states of all composite vortices are generally singly quantized vortices, and no additional long living vortex is formed due to strong dissipation. Our results highlight the important role of temperature and the distinction between dynamics of composite vortices in weakly interacting superfluids without dissipation and strongly interacting case with dissipation, shedding a new light on the understanding of quantum vortex and dynamical instabilities in multicomponent superfluids.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>
