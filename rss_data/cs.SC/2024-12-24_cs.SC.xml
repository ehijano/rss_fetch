      <title>Additive and Multiplicative Coinvariant Spaces of Weyl Groups in the Light of Harmonics and Graded Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite group with an integral representation has two induced canonical actions, one on polynomials and one on Laurent polynomials. Knowledge about the invariants is in either case applied in many computations by means of symmetry reduction techniques, for example in algebraic systems solving or optimization. In this article, we realize the two actions as the additive action on the symmetric algebra and the multiplicative action on the group algebra of a lattice with Weyl group symmetry. By constructing explicit equivariant isomorphisms, we draw algorithmic relations between the two, which allow the transfer and preservation of representation- and invariant-theoretic properties. Our focus lies on the multiplicative coinvariant space, which is identified with the regular representation and harmonic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Coupled differential-algebraic equations framework for modeling six-degree-of-freedom flight dynamics of asymmetric fixed-wing aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling the flight dynamics of a six-degree-of-freedom fixed-wing aircraft as a rigid body with three control surfaces: rudder, elevators, and ailerons. The framework consists of 35 differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and requires 30 constants to be specified. It supports both direct and inverse flight dynamics analyses. In direct dynamics, the historical profiles of control inputs (deflection angles and engine thrust) are specified, and the resulting flight trajectory is predicted. In inverse dynamics, the desired flight trajectory and an additional constraint are specified to determine the required control inputs. The framework employs wind axes for linear-momentum equations and body axes for angular-momentum equations, incorporates two flight path angles, and provides formulas for aerodynamic force and moment coefficients. Key advantages include improved computational efficiency, elimination of Euler angle singularities, and independence from symmetry assumptions with regard to the aircraft's moments of inertia. The model also accounts for nonlinear air density variations with altitude, up to 20 km above mean sea level, making it suitable for accurate and efficient flight dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>APEX$^2$: Adaptive and Extreme Summarization for Personalized Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts, serve various applications. Recently, personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) have emerged as a solution to optimize storage costs by customizing their content to align with users' specific interests within particular domains. In the real world, on one hand, user queries and their underlying interests are inherently evolving, requiring PKGs to adapt continuously; on the other hand, the summarization is constantly expected to be as small as possible in terms of storage cost. However, the existing PKG summarization methods implicitly assume that the user's interests are constant and do not shift. Furthermore, when the size constraint of PKG is extremely small, the existing methods cannot distinguish which facts are more of immediate interest and guarantee the utility of the summarized PKG. To address these limitations, we propose APEX$^2$, a highly scalable PKG summarization framework designed with robust theoretical guarantees to excel in adaptive summarization tasks with extremely small size constraints. To be specific, after constructing an initial PKG, APEX$^2$ continuously tracks the interest shift and adjusts the previous summary. We evaluate APEX$^2$ under an evolving query setting on benchmark KGs containing up to 12 million triples, summarizing with compression ratios $\leq 0.1\%$. The experiments show that APEX outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both query-answering accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Review on Solving Algebra Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving algebra problems (APs) continues to attract significant research interest as evidenced by the large number of algorithms and theories proposed over the past decade. Despite these important research contributions, however, the body of work remains incomplete in terms of theoretical justification and scope. The current contribution intends to fill the gap by developing a review framework that aims to lay a theoretical base, create an evaluation scheme, and extend the scope of the investigation. This paper first develops the State Transform Theory (STT), which emphasizes that the problem-solving algorithms are structured according to states and transforms unlike the understanding that underlies traditional surveys which merely emphasize the progress of transforms. The STT, thus, lays the theoretical basis for a new framework for reviewing algorithms. This new construct accommodates the relation-centric algorithms for solving both word and diagrammatic algebra problems. The latter not only highlights the necessity of introducing new states but also allows revelation of contributions of individual algorithms obscured in prior reviews without this approach.</description>
