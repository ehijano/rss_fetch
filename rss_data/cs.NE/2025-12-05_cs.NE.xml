      <title>Memory-DD: A Low-Complexity Dendrite-Inspired Neuron for Temporal Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dendrite-inspired neurons have been widely used in tasks such as image classification due to low computational complexity and fast inference speed. Temporal data prediction, as a key machine learning task, plays a key role in real-time scenarios such as sensor data analysis, financial forecasting, and urban traffic management. However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings. Compared with traditional neurons without dendritic functions, Memory-DD requires only two neuron groups to extract logical relationships between features in input sequences. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%. These results demonstrate that Memory-DD successfully extends the low-complexity advantages of dendrite-inspired neurons to temporal prediction, providing a low-complexity and efficient solution for time-series data processing.</description>

      <title>MultiGA: Leveraging Multi-Source Seeding in Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across research domains to tackle complex tasks, but their performance can vary significantly depending on the task at hand. Evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can be used to refine solutions iteratively at inference-time. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been exploration on leveraging the collective capabilities of multi-source seeding for LLM-guided genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, MultiGA, which applies genetic algorithm principles to address complex natural language tasks and reasoning problems by sampling from a diverse population of LLMs to initialize the population. MultiGA generates a range of outputs from various parent LLMs, open source and closed source, and uses a neutral fitness function to evaluate them. Through an iterative recombination process, we mix and refine these generations until an optimal solution is achieved. We benchmark our approach using text-to-SQL code generation tasks, trip planning, GPQA benchmark for grad-level science questions, and the BBQ bias benchmark. Our results show that MultiGA converges to the accuracy of the LLM best fit for the task, and these insights lay the foundation for future research looking closer at integrating multiple LLMs for unexplored tasks in which selecting only one pre-trained model is unclear or suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Prescriptive tool for zero-emissions building fenestration design using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing Zero-Emissions Buildings (ZEBs) involves balancing numerous complex objectives that traditional methods struggle to address. Fenestration, encompassing fa\c{c}ade openings and shading systems, plays a critical role in ZEB performance due to its high thermal transmittance and solar radiation admission. This paper presents a novel simulation-based optimization method for fenestration designed for practical application. It uses a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm and relies on rules and an updatable catalog, to fully automate the design process, create a highly diverse search space, minimize biases, and generate detailed solutions ready for architectural prescription. Nineteen fenestration variables, over which architects have design flexibility, were optimized to reduce heating, cooling demand, and thermal discomfort in residential buildings. The method was tested across three Spanish climate zones. Results demonstrate that the considered optimization algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline Genetic Algorithm in both quality and robustness, with these differences proven to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the findings offer valuable insights for ZEB design, highlighting challenges in reducing cooling demand in warm climates, and showcasing the superior efficiency of automated movable shading systems compared to fixed solutions.</description>

      <title>MD-SNN: Membrane Potential-aware Distillation on Quantized Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks, thanks to their sparse binary activation. However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Architecture Search through Grammar-Based Sequence Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) in expressive search spaces is a computationally hard problem, but it also holds the potential to automatically discover completely novel and performant architectures. To achieve this we need effective search algorithms that can identify powerful components and reuse them in new candidate architectures. In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Homeostatic Spark: Zero-Cost Acceleration for SNN Training Across Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event driven computation, sparse activation, and hardware efficiency, yet training often converges slowly and lacks stability. We present Adaptive Homeostatic Spiking Activity Regulation (AHSAR), an extremely simple plug in and training paradigm agnostic method that stabilizes optimization and accelerates convergence without changing the model architecture, loss, or gradients. AHSAR introduces no trainable parameters. It maintains a per layer homeostatic state during the forward pass, maps centered firing rate deviations to threshold scales through a bounded nonlinearity, uses lightweight cross layer diffusion to avoid sharp imbalance, and applies a slow across epoch global gain that combines validation progress with activity energy to tune the operating point. The computational cost is negligible. Across diverse training methods, SNN architectures of different depths, widths, and temporal steps, and both RGB and DVS datasets, AHSAR consistently improves strong baselines and enhances out of distribution robustness. These results indicate that keeping layer activity within a moderate band is a simple and effective principle for scalable and efficient SNN training.</description>

      <title>GRASP: GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Robust Inference of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K &lt;&lt; D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base &amp; RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>GraphBench: Next-generation graph learning benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to ensuring functional stability of neural networks through hardware redundancy at the individual neuron level. Unlike the classical Dropout method, which is used during training for regularization purposes, the proposed system ensures resilience to hardware failures during network operation. Each neuron is implemented on a separate microcomputer (ESP32), allowing the system to continue functioning even when individual computational nodes fail.</description>

      <title>Visuospatial navigation from the bottom-up: without vestibular integration, distance prediction, or maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation is believed to be controlled by at least two partially dissociable systems in the brain. The cognitive map informs an organism of its location and bearing, updated by integrating vestibular self-motion or predicting distances to landmarks. Route-based navigation, on the other hand, directly evaluate sequential movement decisions from immediate percepts. Here we demonstrate the sufficiency of visual route-based decision-making in a classic open field navigation task often assumed to require a cognitive map. Three distinct strategies emerge to robustly navigate to a hidden goal, each conferring contextual tradeoffs analyzed at both neural and behavioral scales, as well as qualitatively aligning with behavior observed across the biological spectrum. We propose reframing navigation from the bottom-up, through an egocentric episodic perspective without assuming online access to computationally expensive top-down representations, to better explain behavior under energetic or attentional constraints.</description>

      <title>NITRO-D: Native Integer-only Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a pivotal technique for managing the growing computational and memory demands of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit Floating-Point (FP) to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNNs. However, most existing methods typically target DNN inference, while training still relies on FP operations, limiting applicability in environments where FP arithmetic is unavailable. To date, only one prior work has addressed integer-only training, and only for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This paper introduces NITRO-D, a novel framework for training deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely in the integer domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D enables training of integer CNNs without requiring a separate quantization scheme. Specifically, it introduces a novel architecture that integrates multiple local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO-Scaling layer and NITRO-ReLU activation function. The proposed framework also features a novel learning algorithm that employs local error signals and leverages IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed for integer computations. NITRO-D is implemented as an open-source Python library. Extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art image recognition datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. For integer-only MLPs, NITRO-D improves test accuracy by up to +5.96% over the state-of-the-art. It also successfully trains integer-only CNNs, reducing memory requirements and energy consumption by up to 76.14% and 32.42%, respectively, compared to the traditional FP backpropagation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for Deep Sparse Coding via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intersection of sparse coding theory and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish a thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature-learning tasks. We additionally extend this convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for the extraction of deep-sparse features. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn sparser features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insight for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</description>

Abstract: This note addresses the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART) and the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), focusing on their frequent misinterpretations found in the neural network literature. Our remarks aim to support a more accurate understanding of KART and UAT among neural network specialists. In addition, we explore the minimal number of neurons required for universal approximation, showing that the same number of neurons needed for exact representation of functions in KART-based networks also suffices for standard multilayer perceptrons in the context of approximation.</description>

      <title>Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.</description>
