      <title>A novel application of Shapley values for large multidimensional time-series data: Applying explainable AI to a DNA profile classification neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Shapley values to high-dimensional, time-series-like data is computationally challenging - and sometimes impossible. For $N$ inputs the problem is $2^N$ hard. In image processing, clusters of pixels, referred to as superpixels, are used to streamline computations. This research presents an efficient solution for time-seres-like data that adapts the idea of superpixels for Shapley value computation. Motivated by a forensic DNA classification example, the method is applied to multivariate time-series-like data whose features have been classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In DNA processing, it is important to identify alleles from the background noise created by DNA extraction and processing. A single DNA profile has $31,200$ scan points to classify, and the classification decisions must be defensible in a court of law. This means that classification is routinely performed by human readers - a monumental and time consuming process. The application of a CNN with fast computation of meaningful Shapley values provides a potential alternative to the classification. This research demonstrates the realistic, accurate and fast computation of Shapley values for this massive task</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis on the effectiveness of a low insulin index, alkaline and functional diet evaluated with machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a statistical analysis of the performance of a low insulin index, alkaline and functional diet developed by ANTUR evaluated with machine learning techniques is reported. The sample of patients was checked on a regular basis with a BioImpedenziometric (BIA) analysis. The BIA gives about 40 parameters output describing the health status of the patient. The sample of 1626 patients was grouped in clusters with similar characteristics by a neural network algorithm. A study of the behaviour of the BIA parameters evolution over time with respect to the first visit was performed. More than the 75% of the patient that followed the ANTUR diet showed an improvement of the health status.</description>

      <title>Loop-Diffusion: an equivariant diffusion model for designing and scoring protein loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting protein functional characteristics from structure remains a central problem in protein science, with broad implications from understanding the mechanisms of disease to designing novel therapeutics. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods are limited by scarce and biased experimental data, and physics-based methods are either too slow to be useful, or too simplified to be accurate. In this work, we present Loop-Diffusion, an energy based diffusion model which leverages a dataset of general protein loops from the entire protein universe to learn an energy function that generalizes to functional prediction tasks. We evaluate Loop-Diffusion's performance on scoring TCR-pMHC interfaces and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in recognizing binding-enhancing mutations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Drug-induced Plasticity via Drug Screen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer drugs inadvertently induce plasticity, reverting differentiated cancer cells to drug-resistant stem-like states. Addressing this phenomenon is crucial for advancing cancer therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework based on multi-type branching processes that can dissect tumor dynamics and drug effects from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data involving AGS-SORE6+/- cells treated with ciclopirox olamine, we show how our framework can be used to confirm the presence of drug-induced cell plasticity.</description>

      <title>Automated Cell Structure Extraction for 3D Electron Microscopy by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the 3D structures of cells and tissues is crucial in biology. Sequential cross-sectional images from electron microscopy provide high-resolution intracellular structure information. The segmentation of complex cell structures remains a laborious manual task for experts, demanding time and effort. This bottleneck in analyzing biological images requires efficient and automated solutions. In this study, the deep learning-based automated segmentation of biological images was explored to enable accurate reconstruction of the 3D structures of cells and organelles. An analysis system for the cell images of {\em Cyanidioschyzon merolae}, a primitive unicellular red algae, was constructed. This system utilizes sequential cross-sectional images captured by a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). A U-Net was adopted and pre-training was performed to identify and segment cell organelles from single-cell images. In addition, the segmentation anything model (SAM) and 3D watershed algorithm were employed to extract individual 3D images of each cell from large-scale microscope images containing numerous cells. Finally, the pre-trained U-Net was applied to segment each structure within these 3D images. Through this procedure, the creation of 3D cell models could be fully automated. The developed approach can be applied to other cell types, and a versatile analysis system will be built in future research. The adoption of other deep learning techniques and combinations of image processing methods will also be explored to enhance the segmentation accuracy further.</description>

      <title>Modeling PROTAC Degradation Activity with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PROTACs are a promising therapeutic modality that harnesses the cell's built-in degradation machinery to degrade specific proteins. Despite their potential, developing new PROTACs is challenging and requires significant domain expertise, time, and cost. Meanwhile, machine learning has transformed drug design and development. In this work, we present a strategy for curating open-source PROTAC data and an open-source deep learning tool for predicting the degradation activity of novel PROTAC molecules. The curated dataset incorporates important information such as $pDC_{50}$, $D_{max}$, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. Our model architecture leverages learned embeddings from pretrained machine learning models, in particular for encoding protein sequences and cell type information. We assessed the quality of the curated data and the generalization ability of our model architecture against new PROTACs and targets via three tailored studies, which we recommend other researchers to use in evaluating their degradation activity models. In each study, three models predict protein degradation in a majority vote setting, reaching a top test accuracy of 80.8% and 0.865 ROC AUC, and a test accuracy of 62.3% and 0.604 ROC AUC when generalizing to novel protein targets. Our results are not only comparable to state-of-the-art models for protein degradation prediction, but also part of an open-source implementation which is easily reproducible and less computationally complex than existing approaches.</description>
