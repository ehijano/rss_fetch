      <title>A geometric Particle-In-Cell discretization of the drift-kinetic and fully kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the geometric Particle in Cell framework on dual grids to a gauge-free drift-kinetic Vlasov--Maxwell model and its coupling with the fully kinetic model. We derive a discrete action principle on dual grids for our drift-kinetic model, such that the dynamical system involves only the electric and magnetic fields and not the potentials as most drift-kinetic and gyrokinetic models do. This yields a macroscopic Maxwell equation including polarization and magnetization terms that can be coupled straightforwardly with a fully kinetic model.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivities and low frequency opacities in the warm dense matter regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine different approaches for calculating low frequency opacities in the warm dense matter regime. The relevance of the average-atom approximation and of different models for calculating opacities, such as the Ziman or Ziman-Evans models is discussed and the results compared to \textit{ab initio} simulations. We begin by recalling the derivation of the Ziman-Evans resistivity from Kubo's linear response theory, using the local approximation to the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. With the help of this approximation, we explicitly introduce an ionic structure factor into the Ziman formula, without resorting to the Born approximation. Both approaches involve the calculation of scattering phase shifts, which we integrate from Calogero equation with an adaptive step numerical scheme based on a Runge-Kutta-Merson solver. We show that if the atomic number $Z$ is not too large, integrating the phase shifts in this way is more time-efficient than using a classical Numerov-type scheme to solve the radial Schr\"odinger equation. Various approximations are explored for phase shifts to further improve computation time. For the Born approximation, we show that using Born phase shifts directly in the scattering cross-section gives more accurate results than with the integral formula based on the Fourier transform of the electron-ion potential. We also compare an analytical formula based on a Yukawa fit of the electron-ion potential to a numerical integration. The average-atom results are compared with DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for aluminum in the dilute regime and for copper, aluminum and gold at solid density and different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of Plasmas in Podolsky corrected Photonic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory for abelian plasma permeated by photons has been developed considering QED (quantum electrodynamics) generalized in Podolsky electrodynamics framework for consideration of higher order terms in electromagnetic theory. The theory traces out photonic degrees of freedom in plasma and accounts for plasma dynamics mediated by photons by calculated effective Hamiltonian. New modes of propagation have been predicted along with suppression of fields and collective behaviour. Non-Markovian behaviour is also discovered for plasma states and interactions in finite plasma system. This finds applicability in solid-state plasma, plasma confinement of magnetic and inertial nature, and laser-plasma interaction when theory is reduced to local interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in piezoelectric semiconductor plasmas : Solitons and transmission feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the coupling between lattice ion vibrations and electron waves in a piezoelectric semiconductor quantum plasma is presented. The nonlinearities have been analyzed, and solitons have been studied. The theory is built using the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model, incorporating the effects of Fermi pressure, quantum Bohm potential, and exchange-correlation potentials. The dispersion relation for the coupling is established. A set of nonlinear evolution equations has been derived using the two-time scale theory, and a soliton solution for the coupled nonlinear evolution equations is obtained using the modified quantum Zakharov equations. The solitons are found to have a cusp profile. It is also found that the solitons' field amplitude increases significantly with particle density and coupling strength in piezoelectric semiconductor quantum plasmas.</description>

      <title>Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence system for Space and Phase-resolved Ion Velocity Distribution Function Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) system for two-dimensional (2D) spatial and phase-resolved ion velocity distribution function (IVDF) measurements. A continuous-wave tunable diode laser produces a laser sheet that irradiates the plasma, and the resulting fluorescence is captured by an intensified CCD (ICCD) camera. Fluorescence images recorded at varying laser wavelengths are converted into 2D IVDFs using the Doppler shift principle. Comparing six image filters, the singular-value decomposition (SVD)-based noise filtering is identified as the most effective for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio while preserving the IVDF structure. The developed ICCD-based PLIF system is tested in an electron-beam generated $E \times B$ plasma with a moderate bulk plasma density of $\sim10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$. The PLIF measurements are validated against a conventional single-point LIF method using photomultiplier tube (PMT)-based detection at various positions. The phase-resolving capability of the system is tested by oscillating the plasma between two nominal operating modes with different density profiles and triggering the ICCD camera with the externally driven plasma oscillation. The resulting oscillations in fluorescence intensity show good agreement with plasma density variations measured by electrostatic probes, demonstrating the systems ability to resolve phase-dependent dynamics. The measured IVDFs reveal several signatures of ion dynamics in this plasma source, including radially outflowing ions and anomalous ion heating in the plasma periphery, as anticipated by theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the influence of electrostatic excitation on instabilities and electron transport in ExB plasma configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially magnetized plasmas in ExB configurations - where the electric and magnetic fields are mutually perpendicular - exhibit a cross-field transport behavior, which is widely believed to be dominantly governed by complex instability-driven mechanisms. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in a variety of plasma technologies, including Hall thrusters, where azimuthal instabilities significantly influence electron confinement and, hence, device performance. While the impact of prominent plasma instabilities, such as the electron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) and the modified two-stream instability (MTSI) on cross-field transport of electron species is well recognized and widely studied, strategies for actively manipulating these dynamics remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the effect of targeted wave excitation on instability evolution and electron transport using one- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of representative plasma discharge configurations. A time-varying electric field is applied axially to modulate the spectral energy distribution of the instabilities across a range of forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Our results reveal that the so-called "unsteady forcing" can both suppress and amplify instability modes depending on excitation parameters. In particular, across both 1D and 2D simulation configurations, forcing near 40 MHz effectively reduces ECDI amplitude and decreases axial electron transport by about 30%, while high-frequency excitation near the electron cyclotron frequency induces spectral broadening, inverse energy cascades, and enhanced transport. These findings point to the role of nonlinear frequency locking and energy pathway disruption as mechanisms for modifying instability-driven transport. Our results offer insights into potential pathways to enhance plasma confinement and control in next-generation ExB devices.</description>

      <title>On Dual Mechanisms Limiting Density in the Negative Triangularity Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high plasma density is essential for maximizing thermonuclear power and thus crucial for realizing economically viable fusion energy; however, this is often constrained by a fundamental density limit. This study investigates the L-mode density limit in negative triangularity (NT) plasmas on the DIII-D tokamak, and the results provide novel insights into this long-standing challenge. We report sustained operations at densities up to 1.8 times the conventional Greenwald limit with 13 MW of auxiliary heating power. Importantly, systematic power scans reveal distinct power scaling relationships for core ($n_{e} \propto P_{\text{SOL}}^{0.27\pm 0.03}$) and edge ($n_{e} \propto P_{\text{SOL}}^{0.42\pm 0.04}$) densities, which suggest different limiting mechanisms at play and point to a more nuanced picture than the traditional paradigm of a single, universal density limit. In this vein, detailed measurements were performed, revealing a complex interplay of macroscopic profiles, radiation patterns, and turbulent transport. Specifically, edge turbulent transport increased as density rose, leading to enhanced divertor radiation and subsequent MARFE onset. The edge density saturated abruptly following MARFE formation. In contrast, the core density continues to increase, ultimately limited by enhanced turbulence that exhibits characteristics of avalanche-like transport. Consistent with enhanced turbulence, toroidal rotation and the $E_r \times B$ flow shear also collapsed approaching the density limit. Taken together, these observations suggest that MARFE dynamics primarily govern the edge density limit, while turbulence-driven transport dominates the core density limit. These results also indicate the feasibility of operations significantly beyond the Greenwald density in high-power NT plasmas.
  This can potentially be attained through advanced control of core turbulence and MARFEs.</description>

      <title>SOLPS-ITER simulation of an X-point radiator in TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SOLPS-ITER simulation is performed to reproduce the X-point radiator recently observed in nitrogen-seeded TCV experiments, which is a scenario that may be favorable to solve the power exhaust problems in future fusion devices. The simulations reveal the transition from the detached regime without XPR to the XPR regime, when increasing the nitrogen seeding rate. A cold X-point core surrounded by ionizing and radiative mentals is formed inside the separatrix and slightly above the X-point, where more than 90% of the total input power is dissipated. The cold X-point core exhibits a temperature of approximately 1eV and features high recombination rate to host the convective fluxes from the ionizing mental. Increasing nitrogen seeding rate also moves the nitrogen ionization front away from the target faster than the nitrogen stagnation point, which enhances the divertor nitrogen leakage to the main chamber and benefits the XPR region cooling. Carbon radiation decreases as the nitrogen seeding increases, and carbon radiation contributes to above 5% of the core impurity radiation before entering the XPR, which decreases to 2.8% when reaching the XPR. Both baffled and unbaffled divertor geometries are simulated and compared, showing that baffles facilitate the access to XPR by increasing the X-point neutral density, but requires higher seeding rate to enter the XPR regime.</description>

      <title>Neutral pressure measurement in TCV tokamak using ASDEX-type pressure gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the neutral gas distribution at the edge of magnetic confinement fusion devices is critical for plasma exhaust studies. In the TCV tokamak, a set of ASDEX-type hot ionization pressure gauges (APGs) has been installed for fast, in-situ measurements of the neutral pressure distribution in the TCV chamber. The APGs have been calibrated against baratron pressure gauges (BGs) for pressures ranging from less than 1 mPa to several hundred mPa. A correction to account for the residual pressure in the pumped torus is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy. APG measurements in a series of plasma discharges with varied density ramp rates are analyzed and compared with the BG pressure measurements. APG measurements feature a significantly faster time response and extend the BG measurement range to lower pressures. APGs systematically measure higher neutral pressures than the BGs connected to the same TCV port, likely due to the BGs slower time response and a nonuniform neutral distribution in gauge ports during the plasma discharge. The initial APG operations in TCV have been proven successful, which validates the APG as an adequate pressure measurement technique for the upcoming TCV divertor upgrades.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid waves during asymmetric reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data to investigate electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid drift waves during magnetopause reconnection. We analyze waves observed in an electron-scale plasma mixing layer at the edge of the magnetospheric outflow. Using high-resolution 7.5 ms electron moments, we obtain an electron current density with a Nyquist frequency of ~66 Hz, sufficient to resolve most of the lower hybrid drift wave power observed in the event. We then employ wavelet analysis to evaluate dJ.dE, which accounts for the phase differences between the fluctuating quantities. The analysis shows that the energy exchange is localized within the plasma mixing layer, and it is highly fluctuating, with energy bouncing between waves and electrons throughout the analyzed time and frequency range. However, the cumulative sum over time indicates a net energy transfer from the waves to electrons. We observe an anomalous electron flow toward the magnetosphere, consistent with diffusion and electron mixing. These results indicate that waves and electrons interact dynamically to dissipate the excess internal energy accumulated by sharp density gradients. We conclude that the electron temperature profile within the plasma mixing layer is produced by a combination of electron diffusion across the layer, as well as heating by large-scale parallel potential and lower hybrid drift waves.</description>
