      <title>Bounding the interleaving distance on concrete categories using a loss function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interleaving distance is arguably the most widely used metric in topological data analysis (TDA) due to its applicability to a wide array of inputs of interest, such as (multiparameter) persistence modules, Reeb graphs, merge trees, and zigzag modules. However, computation of the interleaving distance in the vast majority of this settings is known to be NP-hard, limiting its use in practical settings. Inspired by the work of Chambers et al. on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, we solve a more general problem bounding the interleaving distance between generalized persistence modules on concrete categories via a loss function. This loss function measures how far an assignment, which can be thought of as an interleaving that might not commute, is from defining a true interleaving. We give settings for which the loss can be computed in polynomial time, including for certain assumptions on $k$-parameter persistence modules.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reconciliation: Error reduction theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear constraints, analogous to those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide an error reduction theorem for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for general manifolds with codimension &gt; 1. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, JNLR, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation procedures.</description>
