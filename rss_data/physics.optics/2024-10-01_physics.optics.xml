      <title>The optimal vector phase matching conditions in biaxial crystalline materials determined by extreme surfaces method: the case of orthorhombic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal geometries of vector phase matching are determined for the cases of second harmonic, sum and difference frequency generation in a number of orthorhombic nonlinear optical crystals - KTP, KTA, KB5, KNbO3, LBO, CBO, LRB4. Extreme surface method was used to define wave vectors directions of highest possible generation efficiency. As it is shown, in a significant number of cases vector phase matching ensures higher efficiencies than the scalar one.</description>

      <title>Novel and Simple Method for Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to generate the broadest Raman probe spectrum to our knowledge (spanning -6000 to 0 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Speckle-illumination spatial frequency domain imaging with a stereo laparoscope for profile-corrected optical property mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compact, two-camera laparoscope that combines active stereo depth estimation and speckle-illumination spatial frequency domain imaging (si-SFDI) to map profile-corrected, pixel-level absorption and reduced scattering optical properties in tissues with complex geometries. Our approach uses multimode fiber-coupled laser illumination to generate high-contrast speckle patterns, requiring only two images for optical property estimation. We demonstrate 3D profilometry using active stereo from low-coherence RGB laser flood illumination, which corrects for measured intensity variations caused by object height and surface angle differences. Validation against conventional SFDI in phantoms and an in-vivo human finger study showed good agreement, with profile-correction improving accuracy for complex geometries. This stereo-laparoscopic implementation of si-SFDI provides a simple method to obtain accurate optical property maps through a laparoscope, potentially offering quantitative endogenous contrast for minimally invasive surgical guidance.</description>

      <title>New measurement method for weak magnetic fields using magnetically induced deformation of chemical bonds in Co-CsPbBr3 quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research on weak magnetic field detection is of great significance in advancing the development of bioscience, aerospace, chip manufacturing and other fields. However, the weak magnetic detecting still face some problems, including the large size of the detectors and the limited detection scale. To contribute to the detection of weak magnetic fields, the Co-CsPbBr3 colloidal quantum dots (QDs) composite magnetic material was synthesised on the basis of the theory of room temperature ferromagnetism, molecular polarisation and vibration level of chemical bond. The synthesis involved the mixing of Co2+ into CsPbBr3, an all-inorganic perovskite with activated ions. Subsequently, a weak magnetic field measurement system was devised, comprising working medium samples and a vibration level detection optical path. Following the acquisition, comparison, processing and analysis of multiple data sets, a Stokes displacement function model was established under different magnetic field sizes and the weak magnetic field intensity range of Pitsla (pT) was measured. The Pitsla weak magnetic field measurement system proposed in this paper provides a reference for the development of non-contact weak magnetic measurement methods and for the advancement of intelligent and low-dimensional weak signal measurement applications.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response for Modulation at Optical Time Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid modulation of the electromagnetic response in both time and space creates temporal boundaries in the medium and leads to time-reflection and time-refraction of light and to the eventual formation of the photonic time crystal within the modulated optical material,, offering a new regime of light-matter interactions and a potential for practical applications, from non-resonant light amplification to tunable lasing. However, the conventional approach commonly used for the photonic time crystals and related phenomena that relies on the concept of effective time-dependent refractive index, is fundamentally unsuitable to this domain of ultra-fast modulation at optical time scales. We develop the appropriate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response and the resulting phenomena in this regime, and demonstrate not only quantitative but also qualitative differences from the conclusions obtained using the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Chirped pulse waveguide amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a single-mode Cr:ZnS crystalline waveguide ultrafast amplifier that provides a high gain of 5.5 dB/cm and 2.35 W of average output power. The depressed-cladding buried waveguide is produced by an ultrafast laser writing procedure, which allows a high degree of flexibility in fabrication when the geometry, size, and even effective index can be modified along the waveguide. An analytical model that includes both, pump and pulse propagation, allows calculation and optimization of the waveguide design. In a CPA arrangement with a volume Bragg grating-based stretcher/compressor, we demonstrate a broadband 34-mm long amplifier in a polycrystalline Cr:ZnS with a single-pass gain factor of 75 (5.5 dB/cm) and a high average output power up to 2.35 W.</description>

      <title>Observation of Superoscillation Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superoscillation (SO) wavefunctions, that locally oscillate much faster than its fastest Fourier component, in light waves have enhanced optical technologies beyond diffraction limits, but never been controlled into 2D periodic lattices. Here, we report the 2D superoscillation lattices (SOL) with controlled symmetries, where the local wavevector can be 700 times larger than the global maximal wavevector (k0) in a localized region 100 times smaller than the global minimal wavelength ({\lambda}0). We also demonstrate the superoscillation superlattices (SOSL) as twisted bilayer Moir\'e patterns of two SOL, akin to the magic angle tuning in advanced twistronics, we can continually tune the ondemand SO with local maximal wavevector in a range of 450k0 to 700k0 and with {\lambda}0/100 to{\lambda}0/1000. The twistronic SOSL will advance optical imaging and metrology into extreme higher dimensional superresolution.</description>

      <title>High-Order Harmonic Generation Driven by Perfect Optical Vortex Beams: Exploring the Orbital Angular Momentum Upscaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) light beams for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) provide an additional degree of freedom to study the light-matter interaction at ultrafast timescales. A more sophisticated configuration is a perfect optical vortex (POV) beam, a light beam with a helical wavefront characterized by a phase singularity at its center and an azimuthal phase variation. POV beams are characterized by a radial profile which is independent of the OAM. Here we study the non-perturbative process of gas-phase HHG using a linearly polarized POV beam. We observe that the harmonics are emitted with similar divergence due the perfectness of the POV-driven harmonics. Furthermore, the topological charge upscaling is rigorously followed. We show that a POV beam is more advantageous than that of the Laguerre-Gaussian beam for cases where a large topological charge with a small core size is required. Our research establishes a pathway for producing bright structured extreme ultraviolet (XUV) coherent radiation sources--a pivotal tool with multifaceted applications across various technological domains.</description>

      <title>Band alignment effect in the topological photonic alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a photonic alloy with non-trivial topological properties has been proposed, based on the random mixing of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and magnetized YIG rods. When the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods is less than one, a chiral edge state (CES) of the topological photonic alloy appears in the frequency range of the non-trivial topological gap of the magnetized YIG crystal. In this work, we surprisingly find that by randomly mixing the Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) and magnetized YIG rods in a square lattice, the photonic alloy system with appropriate doping concentrations can present CES in special frequency intervals even when both components support the propagation of bulk states. Analyzing the band structure of two components, we noticed a shift between the first trivial bandgap for PEC and the first topological bandgap for magnetized YIG. When calculating the transmission spectrum of the photonic alloy, we discovered that the frequency range for the topological gap gradually opens from the lower limit frequency of the bandgap for PEC to the bandgap for the magnetized YIG rods. The topological gap opening occurs as the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods increases, creating an effective band alignment effect. Moreover, the topological gap for the photonic alloy is confirmed by calculating the reflection phase winding with the scattering method. Lastly, the gradual appearance of the CES is identified by applying Fourier transformation to real-space electromagnetic fields. Our work broadens the possibilities for flexible topological gap engineering in the photonic alloy system.</description>

      <title>Helicity-selected near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses generated from mixed He-Ne gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and theoretically demonstrate a method for generating helicity-selected near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses in mixed He-Ne gases using bichromatic counter-rotating circularly polarized (BCCP) fields. High-order harmonics driven by BCCP fields exhibit circular polarization for individual orders in the frequency domain, but adjacent orders have opposite helicities. By utilizing the He-Ne mixture, we select only one helical component of the harmonics, resulting in the generation of highly elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in the time domain. Our analyses based on the quantum-orbit theory and the strong field approximation further clarify that the polarization of attosecond pulses is governed by the interference mechanism of high-order harmonics emitted by He and Ne. This combination of BCCP fields and an atomic mixture which requires no alignment in experiments, significantly simplifies the generation of elliptically polarized harmonics dominated by one helical component, thereby paving the way for an efficient and robust method to generate bright attosecond pulses with large ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Skin Solitons in Temporal Photonic Feedback Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), i.e., the localization of eigenstates near lattice boundaries, has recently spurred tremendous interest in topological physics. Beyond the well-explored linear NHSE, the interplay of nonlinearity and skin localization represents a cutting-edge area of research, offering novel insights into wave propagation and localization control in various physical systems. Unlike the linear NHSE successfully observed in weak-power optical systems, the observation of nonlinear NHSE and resulting skin solitons remains so far elusive, mainly due to the high energy levels required in most of nonlinear effects. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nonlinear NHSE in a Kerr nonlinear temporal photonic lattice, where the high-power limitation and lack of tunability intrinsic to optical materials are overcome by an artificial nonlinearity arising from opto-electronic feedback. Thanks to Kerr self-trapping, the nonlinear NHSE is demonstrated to possess much better localization strength and robustness at the preferred boundary compared to the linear case. Away from the preferred boundary, Kerr self-trapping can even inhibit NHSE-induced transport and form stable skin solitons. Harnessing the nonlinearity-controlled NHSE, we judiciously design an optical router with a flexibly-tuned output port. Our findings promise great applications in robust signal transmission, routing, and processing.</description>

      <title>Frequency-shifted laser feedback interferometry in non-planar ring oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser feedback interferometry (LFI) has a wide range of applications such as displacement, distance and velocity measurements. LFI has been realized in many types of lasers but has never been reported in non-planar ring oscillators (NPRO) to the best of our knowledge. In this letter, we present a new type of LFI based on an NPRO laser. The intrinsic resistance to optical feedback in NPROs is broken under weak-magnetic-intensity condition, where stable bidirectional lasing is initiated in the ring cavity. The interference signal, i.e., the beat of the bidirectional lasing is with frequency from a few hundred of kilohertz to a few megahertz which is mainly determined by the applied magnetic intensity in NPRO. Frequency-shifted LFI is thus constructed in NPRO without using acousto-optic modulators as mostly used in conventional LFI. A theoretical model is established to well describe the phenomenon. In the end, micro-vibrational measurements are demonstrated to prove the potential application, where vibration-detection amplitude limit below 30 pm, vibration-detection frequency range from a few kilohertz to a few hundred kilohertz is achieved. Benefiting from the characteristics of tiny footprint, ruggedized structure, long lifetime and ultralow-noise of NPRO lasers, NPRO-based LFI may find important applications in industry, scientific research, military and aerospace.</description>

      <title>Fourier Domain Physics Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optics is driven by a myriad of complex nonlinear dynamics. The ubiquitous presence of governing equations in the form of partial integro-differential equations (PIDE) necessitates the need for advanced computational tools to understand the underlying physical mechanisms. From the experimental perspective, signal-to-noise ratio and availability of measurable data, accounts for a bottle neck in numerical and data-driven modeling methods. In this paper we extend the application of the physics informed neural network (PINN) architecture to include prior knowledge in both the physical and Fourier domain. We demonstrate our Fourier Domain PINN (FD-PINN) in two distinct forms. The Continuous time FD-PINN is used to predict accurate solutions to the Generalized Pulse Propagation Equation, which includes the complete delayed nonlinear response, in the data-starved and noisy regime. We extend the architecture to the Discrete time FD-PINN to recover the delayed-response physics from spatially separated measurement points. We conducted the first systematic study of the effect of SNR on the spatiotemporal field prediction as well as physics discovery. Our architecture ensures high fidelity predictive modeling and hidden physics recovery for applications such as image reconstruction, pulse characterization and shaping, as well as hidden parameter discovery. The benefits of the FD-PINN for ultrafast nonlinear optics make it immediately experimentally deployable. FD-PINN represents the next generation of tools to study optical phenomena both through modeling and measurements for both forward and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Finite-Difference Time-Domain Simulation of Wave Transmission Through Space-Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the generalized Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical modelling of electromagnetic wave scattering from space-time-varying media. We investigate the dynamic behavior of generalized oblique and normal incidence of both TM and TE electromagnetic fields on space-time-modulated gratings. In their most general form, these gratings have electrical permittivity, magnetic permeability, and electrical conductivity modulated across both space and time. The FDTD scheme and equations for both TM and TE wave illuminations of space-time-varying slabs are provided. Additionally, intriguing illustrative examples are presented, including the nonlinear multi-beam-multi-frequency generator and linear pure beam-splitting frequency generation for generalized oblique TM wave incidence, as well as the antenna-mixer-amplifier, nonreciprocal slab, diffraction grating, and nonreciprocal beamsplitter for TE wave incidence. Through these examples, we showcase the versatility and potential applications of space-time-varying microwave components in modern communication systems, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Single-gate electro-optic beam switching metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic active metasurfaces have attracted attention due to their ability to electronically control optical wavefront with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. In most studies, such devices require gate arrays composed of a large number of independently-controllable local gate electrodes that address local scattering response of individual metaatoms. Although this approach in principle enables arbitrary wavefront control, the complicated driving mechanism and low optical efficiency have been hindering its practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate an active beam switching device that provides high directivity, uniform efficiency across diffraction orders, and a wide field of view while operating with only a single-gate bias. Experimentally, the metasurface achieves 57{\deg} of active beam switching from the 0th to the -1st order diffraction, with efficiencies of 0.084 and 0.078 and directivities of 0.765 and 0.836, respectively. Furthermore, an analytical framework using nonlocal quasinormal mode expansion provides deeper insight into the operating mechanism of active beam switching. Finally, we discuss the performance limitations of this design platform and provide insights into potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Integrated RF Photonic Front-End Capable of Simultaneous Cascaded Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic (MWP) front-ends are capable of ultra-broadband signal reception and processing. However, state-of-the-art demonstrations are limited to performing only one specific functionality at any given time, which fails to meet the demands of advanced radio frequency applications in real-world electromagnetic environments. In this paper, we present a major departure from the current trend, which is a novel integrated MWP front-end capable of simultaneous cascaded functions with enhanced performances. Our integrated MWP front-end can delay or phase-shift signals within the selected frequency band while simultaneously suppressing noise signals in other frequency bands, resembling the function of a conventional RF front-end chain. Moreover, we implement an on-chip linearization technique to improve the spurious-free dynamic range of the system. Our work represents a paradigm shift in designing RF photonic front-ends and advancing their practical applications.</description>

      <title>CNN-Assisted Particle Swarm Optimization of a Perturbation-Based Model for Nonlinearity Compensation in Optical Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear signal distortions are one of the primary factors limiting the capacity and reach of optical transmission systems. Currently, several approaches exist for compensating nonlinear distortions, but for practical implementation, algorithms must be simultaneously accurate, fast, and robust against various interferences. One established approach involves applying perturbation theory methods to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which enables the determination of the relation between transmitted and received symbols. In most studies, gradient methods are used to find perturbation coefficients by minimizing the mean squared error between symbols. However, the main parameter characterizing the quality of information transmission is the bit error rate. We propose a modification of the conventional perturbation-based approach for fiber nonlinearity compensation in the form of a two-stage scheme for calculating perturbation coefficients. In the first stage, the coefficients are computed using a convolutional neural network by minimizing the mean squared error. In the second stage, the obtained solution is used as an initial approximation for minimizing the bit error rate using the particle swarm optimization method. In numerical experiments, using the nonlinearity compensation algorithm based on the proposed scheme, we achieved a 0.8~dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio for a 16QAM 20$\times$100 km link with a channel rate of 267~Gbit/s and demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the single-stage scheme. We estimated computational complexity of the algorithm and demonstrated the relation between its complexity and accuracy. Additionally, we developed a method for learning perturbation coefficients without relying on ideal symbols from the transmitter, instead using the received symbols after hard decision detection.</description>

      <title>Building and aligning a 10-plane light converter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate the spatial structure of light is fundamental for a range of applications, from classical communication to quantum information processing. Multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) addresses the limitations of single-plane modulation by enabling full control over multiple spatial modes of light through a series of phase masks separated by free-space propagation. In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide for building and aligning a 10-plane programmable light converter using a single spatial light modulator (SLM) and standard optical components. Our method allows precise alignment, achieving single-pixel accuracy with a relatively simple setup. We hope that this guide will help other researchers to quickly adopt and adapt MPLC technology for their own experiments.</description>

      <title>Individually Addressable Nanoscale OLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), require miniaturized displays with ultrahigh pixel densities. Here, we demonstrate an individually addressable subwavelength OLED pixel based on a nanoscale electrode capable of supporting plasmonic modes. Our approach is based on the notion that when scaling down pixel size, the 2D planar geometry of conventional organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) evolves into a significantly more complex 3D geometry governed by sharp nanoelectrode contours. These cause (i) spatially imbalanced charge carrier transport and recombination, resulting in a low quantum efficiency, and (ii) filament growth, leading to rapid device failure. Here, we circumvent such effects by selectively covering sharp electrode contours with an insulating layer, while utilizing a nano-aperture in flat areas of the electrode. We thereby ensure controlled charge carrier injection and recombination at the nanoscale and suppress filament growth. As a proof of principle, we first demonstrate stable and efficient hole injection from Au nanoelectrodes in hole-only devices with above 90 % pixel yield and longtime operation stability and then a complete vertical OLED pixel with an individually addressable nanoelectrode (300 x 300 nm$^{2}$), highlighting the potential to further leverage plasmonic nanoantenna effects to enhance the performance and functionality of nano-OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Transverse Spin Dynamics in the Nonparaxial Focal Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superposition of complex optical fields in three-dimension (3D) is the basis of several non-trivial wave phenomena. Significant among them are the non-uniform polarization distribution and their topological character, leading to the emergence of transverse spin, transverse momentum, and their dynamics. These aspects are experimentally measured in the nonparaxial focal region of a circularly-polarized Gaussian input beam. A dielectric mirror, kept in the focal region, is axially scanned to obtain the phase and polarization variations in the retro-reflected output beam using an interferometer and spatially-resolved Stokes parameter measurements. The identification of phase and polarization singularities in the beam cross-section and their behaviour as a function of the mirror position enabled us to map and study the phase-polarization variations in the nonparaxial focal region. The lemon-monstar type polarization patterns surrounding the C-point singularity in the output beam are identified and tracked to study the transverse spin dynamics for right- and left- circular polarization of the input beam. Direct measurement of the input beam polarization helicity-independent and helicity-dependent aspects of the transverse and longitudinal spin dynamics in the nonparaxial focal region are the significant findings reported here. The proposed and demonstrated measurement method allows us to investigate the nonparaxial focal region in more detail and has the potential to unravel other intricate optical field effects.</description>

      <title>Regenerative vectorial breathers in a delay-coupled neuromorphic microlaser with integrated saturable absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the polarization dynamics of regenerative light pulses in a micropillar laser with integrated saturable absorber coupled to an external feedback mirror. The delayed self-coupled microlaser is operated in the excitable regime, where it regenerates incident pulses with a supra-threshold intensity -- resulting in a pulse train with inter-pulse period approximately given by the feedback delay time, in analogy with a self-coupled biological neuron. We report the experimental observation of vectorial breathers in polarization angle, manifesting themselves as a modulation of the linear polarized intensity components without significant modulation of the total intensity. Numerical analysis of a suitable model reveals that the observed polarization mode competition is a consequence of symmetry-breaking bifurcations induced by polarization anisotropy. Our model reproduces well the observed experimental results and predicts different regimes as a function of the polarization anisotropy parameters and the pump parameter. We believe that these findings are relevant for the fabrication of flexible sources of polarized pulses with controlled properties, as well as for neuroinspired on-chip computing applications, where the polarization may be used to encode or process information in novel ways.</description>

      <title>Quadratic magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy: Polarization variation method for investigation of magnetic and magneto-optical anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for a precise determination of magnetic anisotropy and anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical response of thin films of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. The method is based on measurements of a magneto-optical response for light close to the normal incidence on the sample with a fixed position. The measurement is performed for a set of orientations of an external magnetic field and a series of incident light linear polarizations beyond the standard s and p orientations. Based on the symmetry of the signal, we are able to separate the part of magneto-optical response that is even with respect to magnetization and, in turn, to exclude all non-magnetic contributions which come from imperfections of the experimental setup or from the sample itself. It is, therefore, possible to study the sample placed inside a cryostat: the polarization changes due to cryostat windows and possible strain-induced optical anisotropy of the sample are removed by the applied data processing. Thanks to this, we can perform measurements on low or elevated temperatures (from 15 to 800 K in our case), making it possible to study the behavior of magnetic materials in different magnetic phases and/or close to phase transitions. The applicability of this experimental technique was tested by measuring the low-temperature response of two samples of ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As with a different Mn content at several wavelengths, which enabled us to deduce the magnetic and quadratic magneto-optical anisotropies in this material. In particular, we observed that the anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical coefficients in (Ga,Mn)As is much weaker than that reported previously for other magnetic material systems.</description>

      <title>Approaching upper bounds to resonant nonlinear optical susceptibilities with inverse-designed quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for identifying bounds to maximum resonant nonlinear optical susceptibilities, and for "inverse designing" quantum-well structures that can approach such bounds. In special cases (e.g. second-harmonic generation) we observe that known bounds, a variety of optimal design techniques, and previous experimental measurements nearly coincide. But for many cases (e.g. second-order sum-frequency generation, third-order processes), there is a sizeable gap between the known bounds and previous optimal designs. We sharpen the bounds and use our inverse-design approach across a variety of cases, showing in each one that the inverse-designed QWs can closely approach the bounds. This framework allows for comprehensive understanding of maximum resonant nonlinearities, offering theoretical guidance for materials discovery as well as targets for computational design.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Local-Resonance Induced Complex Band Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complex band hybridization induced by nonreciprocal local resonances in photonic crystals. Composed of trimer unit cells, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetophotonic crystal with an analytically obtainable solution is considered. We find that nonreciprocal spectral gap may appear without nonreciprocal transmission and that the imaginary parts of the complex wavevectors $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ may blow up at resonance to give extreme nonreciprocal transmission. We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of an Optical Polarization State in a Polarization-Selective Nonlinear Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>

      <title>Classification of Chern Numbers Based on High-Symmetry Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chern number is a crucial topological invariant for distinguishing the phases of Chern insulators. Here we find that for Chern insulators with inversion symmetry, the Chern number alone is insufficient to fully characterize their topology. Specifically, distinct topological phases can be differentiated based on skyrmions at different high-symmetry points. Interfaces between these topological phases exhibit gapless helical states, which provide counter-propagating transport channels and robust quantized transport. Additionally, we identify topological transitions that do not involve changes in the Chern number but can be characterized by transitions of skyrmions between high-symmetry points. These transitions arise due to the toroidal structure of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is generally applicable to two-dimensional periodic lattice system. Our research introduces new degrees of freedom for controlling topological optical transport and deepens the understanding of Chern insulators with inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle is twice the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton bifurcates. We show that the breakdown of the correspondence between the displacement of a soliton and the Chern number arises from the emergence of a new branch of stable soliton solutions mainly consisting of two neighboring instantaneous Wannier functions. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Resistant Photonic Hash Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum hash function based on Gaussian boson sampling on a photonic quantum computer, aiming to provide quantum-resistant security. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this hash function exhibits strong properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance, which are essential for cryptographic applications. Notably, the estimated number of attempts required for a successful collision attack increases exponentially with the mode counts of the photonic quantum computer, suggesting robust resistance against birthday attacks. We also analyze the sampling cost for physical implementation and discuss potential applications to blockchain technologies, where the inherent quantum nature of the hash computation could provide quantum-resistant security. The high dimensionality of the quantum state space involved in the hashing process poses significant challenges for quantum attacks, indicating a path towards quantum security. Our work lays the foundation for a new paradigm of quantum-resistant hashing with applications in emerging quantum-era information systems.</description>

      <title>NeDF: neural deflection fields for sparse-view tomographic background oriented Schlieren</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) density-varying turbulent flows are widely encountered in high-speed aerodynamics, combustion, and heterogeneous mixing processes. Multi-camera-based tomographic background-oriented Schlieren (TBOS) has emerged as a powerful technique for revealing 3D flow density structures. However, dozens of cameras are typically required to obtain high-quality reconstructed density fields. Limited by the number of available optical windows and confined space in the harsh experimental environments, TBOS with only sparse views and limited viewing angles often becomes the necessary choice practically, rendering the inverse problem for TBOS reconstruction severely ill-posed and resulting in degraded tomography quality. In this study, we propose a novel TBOS reconstruction method, neural deflection field (NeDF), utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent the density gradient fields without using any pretrained neural network models. Particularly, state-of-the-art positional encoding techniques and hierarchical sampling strategies are incorporated to capture the density structures of high spatial frequencies. Required background images for TBOS reconstructions are synthesized based on a high-fidelity nonlinear ray-tracing method with the ground truth flows from conducting LES simulations on premixed turbulent flames. Owing to these synthesized BOS images, the superiority of the proposed method is quantitatively verified compared to the classical TBOS reconstruction methods, and the specific contributions from the position encoding and the hierarchical sampling strategy are also elucidated.</description>

      <title>Single-shot reconstruction of three-dimensional morphology of biological cells in digital holographic microscopy using a physics-driven neural network</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based image reconstruction techniques have led to significant progress in phase retrieval using digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM). However, existing deep learning-based phase retrieval methods have technical limitations in generalization performance and three-dimensional (3D) morphology reconstruction from a single-shot hologram of biological cells. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning model, named MorpHoloNet, for single-shot reconstruction of 3D morphology by integrating physics-driven and coordinate-based neural networks. By simulating the optical diffraction of coherent light through a 3D phase shift distribution, the proposed MorpHoloNet is optimized by minimizing the loss between the simulated and input holograms on the sensor plane. Compared to existing DIHM methods that face challenges with twin image and phase retrieval problems, MorpHoloNet enables direct reconstruction of 3D complex light field and 3D morphology of a test sample from its single-shot hologram without requiring multiple phase-shifted holograms or angle scanning. The performance of the proposed MorpHoloNet is validated by reconstructing 3D morphologies and refractive index distributions from synthetic holograms of ellipsoids and experimental holograms of biological cells. The proposed deep learning model is utilized to reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in 3D translational and rotational behaviors and morphological deformations of biological cells from consecutive single-shot holograms captured using DIHM. MorpHoloNet would pave the way for advancing label-free, real-time 3D imaging and dynamic analysis of biological cells under various cellular microenvironments in biomedical and engineering fields.</description>

      <title>All-optical autoencoder machine learning framework using diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), known for its high speed, low power consumption, and strong parallelism, has been widely applied across various fields, including pattern recognition, image processing, and image transmission. However, existing network architectures primarily focus on data representation within the original domain, with limited exploration of the latent space, thereby restricting the information mining capabilities and multifunctional integration of D2NNs. Here, we propose an all-optical autoencoder (OAE) framework that can encode the input wavefield into a prior shape distribution in the latent space and decode the encoded pattern back to the original wavefield. By leveraging the non-reciprocal property of D2NN, the OAE models function as encoders in one direction of wave propagation and as decoders in the opposite direction. We further apply the models to three key areas: image denoising, noise-resistant reconfigurable image classification, and image generation. Proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted to validate numerical simulations. Our OAE framework fully exploits the potential of latent space representations, enabling a single set of diffractive processors to simultaneously achieve image reconstruction, representation, and generation. It can be viewed as both a counterpart and an extension of the electronic autoencoder model. This work not only offers fresh insights into the design of optical generative models but also paves the way for developing and applying multifunctional, highly integrated, and general optical intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links and electromagnetic knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The set of real-analytic Legendrian links with respect to the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere $S^3$ corresponds both to the set of totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links as defined by Rudolph and to the set of stable knotted field lines in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. It is known that every isotopy class has a real-analytic Legendrian representative, so that every link type $L$ admits a holomorphic function $G:\mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}$ whose zeros intersect $S^3$ tangentially in $L$ and there is a Bateman electromagnetic field $\mathbf{F}$ with closed field lines in the shape of $L$. However, so far the family of torus links are the only examples where explicit expressions of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ have been found. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds for every given link type $L$ a real-analytic Legendrian representative, parametrised in terms of trigonometric polynomials. We then prove that (good candidates for) examples of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations, which is homogeneous in the case of $G$ and inhomogeneous in the case of $\mathbf{F}$. We also use the real-analytic Legendrian parametrisations to study the dynamics of knots in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. In particular, we show that no compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ can contain an electromagnetic knot indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under different conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation). This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and non-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based "design$\rightarrow$response" forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex "response$\rightarrow$design" inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.</description>

      <title>Wave-Medium Interactions in Dynamic Matter and Modulation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time modulation systems have garnered significant attention due to their resemblance to moving-matter systems and promising applications. Unlike conventional moving-matter systems, modulation systems do not involve net motion of matter, and are therefore easier to implement and not restricted to subluminal velocities. However, canonical wave-medium interaction aspects, such as scattering and energy-momentum relations, have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues for three dynamic systems: moving-matter blocs, moving-perturbation interfaces and moving-perturbation periodic structures, and provide corresponding general formulations along with comparisons. Our investigation reveals the significant roles played by the "catch-up" effect between waves and interfaces. Even more interestingly, it reveals different energy and momentum exchanges between moving media and homogenized moving-perturbation structures as a result of conventional and reverse Fresnel-Fizeau drag effects.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Beam assisted High-Order Harmonic Generation in Semiconductor Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the context of high harmonic generation (HHG) within semiconductor crystals. Our contribution deals with the transfer and conservation of OAM in the strong-field regime, from the driving laser field to the generated harmonics. To this end, in this work, we combine the semiconductor Bloch equations with the thin slab model to simulate the generation of high-order harmonics in semiconductor media and to compute the features of the far-field harmonics. We demonstrate that this theoretical approach is capable of satisfactorily reproducing previously published experimental features of the generated harmonics in ZnO driven by a Laguerre-Gauss beam. Our research not only deepens the understanding of light-solid interactions but also heralds the dawn of bright, structured XUV coherent radiation sources with unparalleled potential across diverse technological areas, paving the way for enhanced functionalities in fields such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven lensless fiber endomicroscopic quantitative phase imaging towards digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

      <title>All-optical ultrafast arbitrary rotation of hole orbital qubits with direct phase control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the orbital degree of freedom in optically active quantum dots has emerged as a promising candidate. However, the essential ability to perform arbitrary rotations on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary rotation of a hole orbital qubit with direct phase control using picosecond optical pulses. This is achieved by successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems coupled via radiative Auger processes. The new capability enables direct control of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector without requiring timed precession. Our results establish orbital states in solid-state quantum emitters as a viable resource for applications in high-speed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The sample axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and higher-order counter-propagating SPDC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the inter-converted wavelengths. Here we comprehensively investigate the noise spectrum of a QFC device pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a bulk periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal quasi-phase-matched for conversion between 637 nm and 1587 nm, which was also polished and coated to resonantly enhance the pump field by a factor of 50. While Raman scattering dominates the noise background from 1140 nm to 1330 nm, at larger energy shifts (beyond 60 THz), parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the strongest noise source. Further, the noise spectrum was contaminated by a regular succession of narrow-band peaks, which we attribute to a heretofore unidentified higher-order counter-propagating SPDC processes - with quasi-phase-matching orders up to 44 evident in our measurements. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the limiting noise sources in QFC devices that use quasi-phase-matched crystals and will prove an invaluable resource in guiding their future development.</description>
