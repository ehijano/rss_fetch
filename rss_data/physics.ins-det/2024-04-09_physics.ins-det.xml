      <title>Estimating the Energy Threshold of Phonon-mediated Superconducting Qubit Detectors Operated in an Energy-Relaxation Sensing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the lack of a conclusive detection of WIMP dark matter at the 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ mass scale and above has encouraged development of low-threshold detector technology aimed at probing lighter dark matter candidates. Detectors based on Cooper-pair-breaking sensors have emerged as a promising avenue for this detection due to the low (meV-scale) energy required for breaking a Cooper pair in most superconductors. Among them, devices based on superconducting qubits are interesting candidates for sensing due to their observed sensitivity to broken Cooper pairs. We have developed an end-to-end G4CMP-based simulation framework and have used it to evaluate performance metrics of qubit-based devices operating in a gate-based "energy relaxation" readout scheme, akin to those used in recent studies of qubit sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We find that for this readout scheme, the qubit acts as a phonon sensor with an energy threshold ranging down to $\simeq$0.4 eV for near-term performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Theory and mitigation of motional eddy current in high-field eddy current shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eddy current shielding by a Faraday cage is an effective way to shield alternating-current (AC) magnetic fields in scientific instrumentation. In a strong static magnetic field, however, the eddy current in the conductive shield is subject to the Lorentz force which causes the shield to vibrate. In addition to mechanical issues, such vibration induces motional eddy current in the shield that can dominate the original, electromagnetic eddy current to undermine the conductor's shielding capability. In this work we investigate a method to control motional eddy current by making cut-out patterns in the conductor that follow the electromagnetic eddy current image. This effectively limits the surface current of the plate to a single mode and prevents proliferation of uncontrolled motion-induced surface currents that disrupts eddy current shielding. Implications of our results for improved shielding of gradient fields in high-field MRI are discussed.</description>

      <title>Portable diamond maser with reduced magnetic field through orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masers have the potential to transform medical sensing and boost qubit readout detection due to their superb low-noise amplification. The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond maser is the only continuous-wave solid-state maser discovered at room temperature, however it suffers from requiring large and bulky magnets which prevent its more widespread use. We present a significant reduction in size of the entire diamond maser using a much lighter and small-footprint electromagnet, reducing the weight from an immovable 2000 kilograms to a portable 30 kilograms. We achieve a maximum maser output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the first implementation, and have discovered techniques to reduce the magnetic field strength required for masing by precise manipulation of the spin orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a lab benchtop, we have brought continuous-wave room temperature masers away from the confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in quantum computing, frequency standards and quantum-limited medical sensing.</description>

      <title>Cryogen-free modular scanning tunneling microscope operating at 4-K in high magnetic field on a compact ultra-high vacuum platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the daunting challenges in modern low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is the difficulty of combining atomic resolution with cryogen free cooling. Further functionality needs, such as ultra-high vacuum (UHV), high magnetic field, and compatibility with {\mu}m-sized samples, pose additional challenges to an already ambitious build. We present the design, construction, and performance of a cryogen free, UHV, low temperature, and high magnetic field system for modular STM operation. An internal vibration isolator reduces vibrations in this system allowing atomic resolution STM imaging while maintaining a low base temperature of ~4K and magnetic fields up to 9T. Samples and tips can be conditioned in-situ utilizing a heating stage, an ion sputtering gun, an e-beam evaporator, a tip treater, and sample exfoliation. In-situ sample and tip exchange and alignment are performed in a connected UHV room temperature stage with optical access. Multisite operation without breaking vacuum is enabled by a unique quick-connect STM head design. A novel low-profile vertical transfer mechanism permits transferring the STM between room temperature and the low temperature cryostat.</description>

      <title>Laser Resonance Chromatography: First Commissioning Results and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report first results obtained during the commissioning of the Laser Resonance Chromatography (LRC) apparatus, which is conceived to enable atomic structure investigations in the region of the heaviest elements beyond nobelium. In our studies we first established optimum conditions for the operation of the different components of the setup, including the radio-frequency quadrupole ion buncher and the cryogenic drift tube, which was operated with helium buffer gas at relatively low electric fields. We used laser ablated hafnium, lutetium, and ytterbium cations to assess the chromatography performance of the drift tube at a gas temperature of $295$K. Arrival time distributions of singly charged lutetium revealed two distinct ion mobilities of this ion in the ground and metastable state in helium with a relative difference of about $19$%. By using $^{219}$Rn ions from a $^{223}$Ra recoil source the overall efficiency of the apparatus is found to be $(0.6\pm0.1)$%. The findings help to establish LRC on lutetium, which is the lighter chemical homolog of lawrencium.</description>

      <title>Performance of new Kuraray wavelength-shifting fibers with short decay time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the decay time and the attenuation length of newly developed wavelength-shifting fibers, YS series from Kuraray, which have fast response. Using a 405 nm laser, the decay times of the YS-2, 4, and 6 are measured to be $3.64 \pm 0.04$ ns, $2.15 \pm 0.03$ ns, and $1.47 \pm 0.02$ ns, respectively, for the light injection distance of 10 cm. The decay time of Y-11 is measured to be $7.10 \pm 0.09$ ns using the same system. All fibers are found to have similar attenuation lengths of more than 4 meters. When combined with the plastic scintillators EJ-200 and EJ-204, the YS series have better time resolution than Y-11, with light yields of 60-100% of Y-11.</description>

      <title>MMC Array to Study X-ray Transitions in Muonic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QUARTET collaboration aims to significantly improve the precision of the absolute nuclear charge radii of light nuclei from Li to Ne by using an array of metallic magnetic calorimeters to perform high-precision X-ray spectroscopy of low-lying states in muonic atoms. A proof-of-principle measurement with lithium, beryllium and boron is planned for fall 2023 at the Paul Scherrer Institute. We discuss the performance achieved with the maXs-30 detector module to be used. To place the detector close to the target chamber where the muon beam will impact the material under study, we have developed a new dilution refrigerator sidearm. We further discuss the expected efficiency given the transparency of the X-ray windows and the quantum efficiency of the detector. The expected muonic X-ray rate combined with the high resolving power and detection efficiency of the detector suggest that QUARTET will be able to study the de-excitation of light muonic atoms at an unprecedented level, increasing the relative energy resolution by up to a factor of 20 compared to conventional detector techniques.</description>

Abstract: Argon gas doped with 1% wavelength-shifter (CF$_4$) has been employed in an optical time projection chamber (OTPC) to image cosmic radiation. We present results obtained during the system commissioning, performed with two stacked glass-THGEMs and an EMCCD camera at 1 bar. Preliminary estimates indicate that the combined optical gain was of the order of 10$^6$ (ph/e), producing sharp and high-contrast raw images without resorting to any filtering or post-processing. A first assessment of the impact of pressurization showed no change in the attainable gains when operating at 1.5 bar</description>

      <title>Beam Tests of SNSPDs with 120 GeV Protons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the test results for a 120 GeV proton beam incident on superconducting nanowire particle detectors of various wire sizes. NbN devices with the same sensitive area were fabricated with different wire widths and tested at a temperature of 2.8 K. The relative detection efficiency was extracted from bias current scans for each device. The results show that the wire width is a critical factor in determining the detection efficiency and larger wire widths than 400 nm leads to inefficiencies at low bias currents. These results are particularly relevant for novel applications at accelerator facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider, where cryogenic cooling is readily available.</description>

      <title>Improvement on the Linearity Response of PandaX-4T with new Photomultiplier Tubes Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the expanding reach of physics, xenon-based detectors such as PandaX-4T in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory aim to cover an energy range from sub-keV to multi-MeV. A linear response of the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) is required for both scintillation and electroluminescence signals. Through a dedicated bench test, we investigated the cause of the non-linear response in the Hamamatsu R11410-23 PMTs used in PandaX-4T. The saturation and suppression of the PMT waveform observed during the commissioning of PandaX-4T were caused by the high-voltage divider base. The bench test data validated the de-saturation algorithm used in the PandaX-4T data analysis. We also confirmed the improvement in linearity of a new PMT base design, which will be used to upgrade the PMT readout system in PandaX-4T.</description>

      <title>Development and property study of the extremely thin 12 \texorpdfstring{$\mu m$} C-type straw tubes with 5-mm diameter for a Straw Tracker System of COMET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COMET experiment focuses on searching for the direct conversion of a muon into an electron with aluminum nuclei without emitting a neutrino (so-called $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion). This conversion violates charged lepton flavor conservation law, a fundamental principle in the Standard Model. The COMET experiment requirement is to achieve the muon-to-electron conversation sensitivity on a level of $10^{-17}$. The Straw Tracker System (STS) based on straw tubes could provide the necessary spatial resolution of 150 $\mu$m and the electron momentum resolution better than 200 keV/c.
  The COMET experiment will be separated into two phases. Phase-I will operate with the 3.2 kW 8-GeV-proton beam, and Phase-II will operate with beam intensity increased to 56 kW. STS must operate in a vacuum with 1 bar internal pressure applied to straws. The initial design of 10-mm-diameter straws developed for phase-I will not be as efficient with the 20 times increased beam intensity of Phase II, but the new STS design based on 5-mm-diameter 12-$\mu$m thick straws could fully satisfy the required efficiency. The mechanical properties of these straws, such as sagging, elongation, dependence of the diameter on over-pressure, etc, are discussed in this article.</description>

      <title>Dataset for neutron and gamma-ray pulse shape discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The publicly accessible dataset includes neutron and gamma-ray pulse signals for conducting pulse shape discrimination experiments. Several traditional and recently proposed pulse shape discrimination algorithms are utilized to evaluate the performance of pulse shape discrimination under raw pulse signals and noise-enhanced datasets. These algorithms comprise zero-crossing (ZC), charge comparison (CC), falling edge percentage slope (FEPS), frequency gradient analysis (FGA), pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), ladder gradient (LG), and het-erogeneous quasi-continuous spiking cortical model (HQC-SCM). In addition to the pulse signals, this dataset includes the source code for all the aforementioned pulse shape discrimination methods. Moreover, the dataset provides the source code for schematic pulse shape discrimination performance evaluation and anti-noise performance evaluation. This feature enables researchers to evaluate the performance of these methods using standard procedures and assess their anti-noise ability under various noise conditions. In conclusion, this dataset offers a comprehensive set of resources for conducting pulse shape discrimination experiments and evaluating the performance of various pulse shape discrimination methods under different noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>A novel device for controlling the flow of information based on Weyl fermions and some interesting remarks regarding the electromagnetic interactions of high energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel device for controlling the flow of information using Weyl fermions. Based on a previous work of our group, we show that it is possible to fully control the flow of Weyl fermions on several different channels, by applying an electric field perpendicular to the direction of motion of the particles on each channel. In this way, we can transmit information as logical bits, depending on the existence or not of a Weyl current on each channel. We also show that the response time of this device is exceptionally low, less than 1 ps, for typical values of its parameters, allowing the control of the flow of information at extremely high rates, of the order of 100 Petabits per second. Alternatively, this device could also operate as an electric field sensor. In addition, we demonstrate that Weyl fermions can be efficiently guided through the proposed device using appropriate magnetic fields. Finally, we discuss some particularly interesting remarks regarding the electromagnetic interactions of high energy particles.</description>

      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>
