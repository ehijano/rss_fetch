      <title>Beyond Superexchange: Emergent Unconventional Ferromagnetism in Thin-Film Sandwich Structures of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Probing Magnetic Properties of RuO$_{2}$ Heterostructures Through the Ferromagnetic Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_{2}$ has been proposed as the prototypical altermagnetic material. However, several reports have recently questioned its intrinsic magnetic ordering, leading to conflicting findings, especially in thin film heterostructures pointing to possible interface effects being convoluted with supposed antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic signatures. Here, extensive magnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film heterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the ferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias fields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin transitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on RuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer, suggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic ordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that could be ascribed to antiferromagnetism. However, the lack of intrinsic magnon modes points toward possible diffusion between the layers or spin disorder at the interface as seen by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-temperature specific heat of solids and the rationale behind the Maier-Kelley empirical formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and, ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead, silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of elementary physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Electronic Hamiltonian Prediction with Many-Body Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning surrogates of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory Hamiltonians offer a powerful tool to accelerate the prediction of electronic properties of materials, such as electronic band structures and densities-of-states. For large-scale applications, an ideal model would exhibit high generalization ability and computational efficiency. Here, we introduce the MACE-H graph neural network, which combines high body-order message passing with a node-order expansion to efficiently obtain all relevant $O(3)$ irreducible representations. The model achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency and captures the full local chemical environment features of, currently, up to $f$ orbital matrix interaction blocks. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and transferability on several open materials benchmark datasets of two-dimensional materials and a new dataset for bulk gold, achieving sub-meV prediction errors on matrix elements and eigenvalues across all systems. We further analyse the interplay of high body order message passing and locality that makes this model a good candidate for high-throughput material screening.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and preliminary optical and microwave characterization of erbium doped CaMoO$_4$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications. Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Shear Strain Induced Ferroelectric-to-Antiferroelectric Phase Transition and Accessing Intrinsic Antiferroelectricity in Two-dimensional NbOCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the well studied two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity, much rare is the appearance of 2D antiferroelectricity, where local dipoles from the nonequivalent sublattices within 2D monolayers are oppositely orientated. Using NbOCl2 monolayer with competing ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) phases as a 2D material platform, we demonstrate the emerging of intrinsic antiferroelectricity in NbOCl2 monolayer under the experimentally accessible shear strain, and new functionality associated with electric field induced AFE-to-FE phase transition. Specifically, the complex configuration space accommodating FE and AFE phases, polarization switching kinetics and finite temperature thermodynamic properties of 2D NbOCl2, are all accurately predicted by large-scale molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on deep learning interatomic potential (DP) model. Moreover, room temperature stable antiferroelectricity with low polarization switching barrier and one-dimensional (1D) collinear polarization arrangement is predicted in shear deformed NbOCl2 monolayer. Transition from AFE to FE phase in 2D NbOCl2 can be triggered by the low critical electric field, leading to the double polarization-electric (P-E) loop with small hysteresis. A new type optoelectronic device composed of AFE-NbOCl2, enabling electric "writing" and nonlinear optical "reading" logical operation with fast operation speed and low power consumption is also proposed.</description>

      <title>A rutile-based homologous series Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$ discovered by computationally assisted high-pressure synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides typified by the Ruddlesden-Popper phase have been extensively studied for its applications in high-temperature superconductivity, catalysis, and battery technologies. Despite the remarkable structural diversity and catalytic functionality of platinum oxides, the exploration of layered polymorphs has remained significantly constrained mainly due to the high inertness of platinum. Here, we discover a new homologous series of layered ternary oxides, Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$, by a combination of highly oxidizing high-pressure methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs, rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data. This approach provides an effective platform for the exhaustive exploration of metastable transition metal oxides with rich structural variations.</description>

      <title>The effect of multi-occupancy traps on the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes in irradiated tungsten and vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to 600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</description>

      <title>Competition Between Controllable Non-Radiative and Intrinsic Radiative Second-Order Recombination in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies. Understanding and mitigating remaining carrier losses in halide perovskites is now crucial to enable further increases to approach their practical efficiency limits. Whilst the most widely known non-radiative recombination from solar cells relates to carrier trapping and is first order in carrier density, recent reports have revealed a non-radiative pathway that is second order. However, the origin and impact of this second-order process on devices remain unclear. Here, we understand this non-radiative second-order recombination (k2non) pathway by manipulating the charge carrier dynamics via controlling the bulk and surface conditions. By combining temperature-dependent spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the value of k2non depends on extrinsic factors, in contrast to intrinsic second-order recombination, which aligns with theoretical evaluations through van Roosbroeck-Shockley relations. Based on density functional theory simulations and Quasi-Fermi level calculations, we propose that shallow surface states are the primary origin of this second-order non-radiative component, contributing up to ~80 mV of the overall reduction in Voc at room temperature. This work reveals that carrier losses from two non-radiative recombination types (first and second order) are not linked, emphasizing the need for distinctive mitigation strategies targeting each type to unlock the full efficiency potential of perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Explainability for Structure-Property Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are emerging as a universal paradigm for constructing correlative structure-property relationships in materials science based on multimodal characterization. However, this necessitates development of methods for physical interpretability of the resulting correlative models. Here, we demonstrate the potential of attention-based neural networks for revealing structure-property relationships and the underlying physical mechanisms, using the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films as a case study. Through the analysis of attention scores, we disentangle the influence of distinct domain patterns on the polarization switching process. The attention-based Transformer model is explored both as a direct interpretability tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised machine learning, enabling the identification of physically grounded correlations. We compare attention-derived interpretability scores with classical SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and show that, in contrast to applications in natural language processing, attention mechanisms in materials science exhibit high efficiency in highlighting meaningful structural features.</description>

      <title>Revisiting thermal transport in CuCl: First-principles calculations and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in strongly anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs) and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\kappa_l$. Our calculations, including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects in the accurate estimation of $\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure dependence of $\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials.</description>

      <title>NMR evidence for an antisite-induced magnetic moment on Bi in a topological insulator heterostructures MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, combining a topologically protected surface metallic state and intrinsic magnetic order. A structural compatibility with the nonmagnetic Bi2Te4 (BT) parent compound gives a possibility to create MBT/BT heterostructures and manipulate their magnetic state in view of optimizing the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE). In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T, covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer. Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic interactions in the MBT/BT system. These findings have potentially important implications for engineering the QAH devices.</description>

      <title>Accurate complex-stacking-fault Gibbs energy in Ni3Al at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain a deeper insight into the anomalous yield behavior of Ni3Al, it is essential to obtain temperature-dependent formation Gibbs energies of the relevant planar defects. Here, the Gibbs energy of the complex stacking fault (CSF) is evaluated using a recently proposed ab initio framework [Acta Materialia, 255 (2023) 118986], accounting for all thermal contributions - including anharmonicity and paramagnetism - up to the melting point. The CSF energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing analytical models.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of defects in semi-dry transferred CVD graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-transfer in-depth morphological characterization of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is of great importance to evaluate the quality and to understand the origin of defects of the transferred sheets. Herein, a semi-dry transfer technique is used to peel off millimeter-sized CVD graphene flakes from polycrystalline copper foils and transfer them onto SiO2/Si substrates. We take advantage of the unique feature of this semi-dry process: it preserves the copper substrate, enabling location-specific morphological comparisons between graphene and copper at various stages of the transfer. Thanks to a combination of morphological characterization techniques, this leads to trace and elucidate the origin of various post-transfer graphene defects (cracks, wrinkles, holes, tears). Specifically, thermally induced wrinkles are shown to evolve into nanoscale cracks, while copper surface steps lead to folds. Furthermore, we find that the macroscale topography of the copper foil also plays a critical role in defect formation. This work provides guidelines on how to correctly interpret the post-transfer morphology of graphene films on relevant substrates and how to properly assess their quality. This contributes to the optimization of both the graphene CVD growth and transfer processes for future applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice distortions and non-sluggish diffusion in BCC refractory high entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for extreme high-temperature applications, for example, in next-generation turbines and nuclear reactors. In such applications, atomic diffusion critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution) HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. \textit{Ab initio}-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions, and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal important structure-property relationships between local atomic environments and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of impurity diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Automated Modeling of Polarons: Defects and Reactivity on TiO$_2$(110) Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device performance in several technological applications. However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive models for strain energy in condensed phase reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong and ductile CoNiMoAl medium-entropy alloys enabled by L12 nanoprecipitate-induced multiple deformation mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L12 precipitates are known to significantly enhance the strength and ductility of single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) medium- or high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs). However, further improvements in mechanical properties remain untapped, as alloy design has historically focused on systems with specific CrCoNi- or FeCoCrNi-based FCC matrix and Ni3Al L12 phase compositions. This study introduces novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L12 precipitates by systematically altering Al content, aiming to bridge this research gap by revealing the strengthening mechanisms. The (CoNi)81Mo12Al7 alloy achieves yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35 %, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength, ductility, and strain-hardening capacity. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations using density functional theory (DFT), demonstrates that Mo substitution for Al in the L12 phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting the formation of multiple deformation modes, including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries (APBs). The increased energy barrier for superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) formation compared to APBs, due to Mo substitution, further influences dislocation activity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs by expanding the range of FCC matrix and L12 compositions through precipitation hardening.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the interface between Au and WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interface between metals and two-dimensional materials is critical for their application in electronics and for the development of metal-mediated exfoliation of large area monolayers. Studying the intricate interactions at the interface requires model systems that enable control of the roughness, purity, and crystallinity of the metal surface. Here, we investigate the layer-dependent electronic structure of WSe_2 on template-stripped gold substrates fabricated using both silicon and mica templates, giving crystallographically disordered and Au(111) ordered surfaces, respectively, and contrast these findings with ab initio predictions. We observe strong hybridization around the Brillouin zone centre at $\overline{\Gamma}$, indicating a covalent admixture in the gold-\WSe~interaction, and band shifts that suggest charge rearrangement at the Au(111) / WSe_2 interface. Core-level spectroscopy shows a single chemical environment for the interfacial WSe_2 layer on the template-stripped gold, distinct from the subsequent layers. These results reveal a mixture of van der Waals and covalent interactions, best described as a covalent-like quasi-bonding with intermediate interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Octahedral tilting and B-site off-centering in halide perovskites are not coupled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites show exceptional potential for solar energy, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and other photochemical technologies, with performance rooted in electronic structure-driven properties. In ABX3 halide perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However, the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge. We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Potential for Systems with Reduced Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description>

      <title>High Harmonic Spectroscopy from Lower-Order to Higher-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully extended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on fundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear phenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic spectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones, focusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation - namely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend current all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological insulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing three distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model for topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work aims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern insulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can indeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures of topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful analysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order topological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we find a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome lattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic spectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases, particularly for those associated with topological corner states.</description>

      <title>Regularized Perturbation Theory for Ab initio Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals, rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost. In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted, BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control over the spatial coherence, wavefront, and focusability of emitted light relies on understanding the intrinsic phase of the emission process, and vice versa, measuring phase can reveal insights about microscopic generation mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the origin of the dipole phase in solid-state high-harmonic generation is currently missing. Here, by employing attosecond interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulses, we directly assess the intensity- and frequency-dependent dipole phases in magnesium oxide (MgO) in solid-state HHG. We also quantify a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental and disentangle its contribution from the dipole phase. Theoretical models (analytical, two-band, and full-band numerical simulations) support our results. The analytical approach aids future solid-state HHG experiments and simulations, while the full numerical model details orbital- and band-resolved current contributions to the dipole phase. Our research delivers the first combined quantitative measurement and rigorous theoretical description of the harmonic emission phase in solids.</description>

      <title>Suspended phase transitions: droplets trapped by solid films resist complete melting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Melting is conventionally understood as a bulk first-order phase transition, where nucleation of the liquid phase is followed by rapid growth until the solid disappears. However, in thin crystalline films containing local heterogeneities, this process can be dramatically altered by interfacial forces. Here, we report experimental evidence of suspended melting in molecularly thin films of long-chain alkanes containing trapped liquid droplets. As temperature increases, these droplets expand and flatten, yet remain pinned within the surrounding solid layers, preventing full melting. The observed sensitivity of apparent contact angle to small temperature changes is explained by a theoretical model balancing bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energies. This work highlights how melting in thin films can be frustrated and spatially arrested by local wetting constraints, revealing a rich interplay between phase transition dynamics, confinement, and interfacial topology. Beyond alkanes, these results suggest a generic mechanism by which melting, wetting, and film morphology conspire to locally suspend phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Solar-driven water electrolysis requires high-performance photoelectrodes that exhibit excellent photoabsorption, superior charge transport, and optimized thermal management. In this work, we conducted a first-principles investigation to explore optimized doping conditions for hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) by incorporating boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb) mono-dopants, as well as (B, Y) and (B, Nb) co-dopants. To identify the optimal dopant elements and concentrations, we evaluated electronic charge transport, thermal properties, and magnetic susceptibility over a temperature ($T$) range of 300 to 900 K and doping densities ($N$) from $10^{19}$ to $10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$. The B-doped, (B, Y)-doped, and (B, Nb)-doped $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes showed significantly reduced band gap energy ($E_g$) relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. In comparison, Y and Nb dopants only slightly reduced $E_g$ relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. While B doping introduced impurity states near the Fermi level that limited thermoelectric charge transport, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes doped by other elements exhibited notable improvements, including enhanced visible-light absorption, increased carrier concentration, improved electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), and efficient thermal management. Additionally, these doped photoelectrodes exhibited a remarkable increase in Pauli magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, indicating exciting potential for generating spin-selective polarized currents. Overall, our findings revealed that the co-doping conditions are the most effective for enhancing the performance of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, providing a low-cost and high-efficiency solution for sustainable green hydrogen (H$_2$) generation in photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Quantum-size effect induced Andreev bound states in ultrathin metallic islands proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for significant device applications.</description>

      <title>Electron-Hole Crossover in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the superconducting dome in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content and reveal an electron-hole crossover associated with the maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$). This electron-hole crossover, marked by an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), is reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP2K is a versatile open-source software package for simulations across a wide range of atomistic systems, from isolated molecules in the gas phase to low-dimensional functional materials and interfaces, as well as highly symmetric crystalline solids, disordered amorphous glasses, and weakly interacting soft-matter systems in the liquid state and in solution. This review highlights CP2K's capabilities for computing both static and dynamical properties using quantum-mechanical and classical simulation methods. In contrast to the accompanying theory and code paper [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)], the focus here is on the practical usage and applications of CP2K, with underlying theoretical concepts introduced only as needed.</description>

      <title>Controlling polymerization-induced phase separation in the synthesis of porous gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous gels -- gels with solvent-filled pores that are much larger than their mesh size -- are widely used in engineering and biomedical applications due to their tunable mechanics, high water content, and selective permeability. Among various strategies to create porous gels, polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) has shown particular promise. However, the conditions that trigger and control PIPS remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of solvent quality, polymeric precursor molecular weight, and polymer concentration on phase separation in polymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate gels. We find that phase separation occurs when the precursor solution concentration is below the overlap concentration. Phase-separated gels have a pore geometry that is controlled by solvent quality: better solvents result in smaller pores, while worse solvents can create superporous, highly-absorbant gels. Motivated by our results, we propose a theory that predicts when phase separation occurs in polymerizing gels, applicable across a wide range of polymer/solvent gel systems. Our results provide a framework for the rational design of porous gels.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Analysis of Charge Stability Diagrams with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime, while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of quantum dot devices.</description>

      <title>Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Order Controlled by Confinement Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum confinement of surface electrons in two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks offers a powerful route to engineer electronic states for emerging quantum and spintronic technologies at the molecular scale. To date, such confinement has been understood primarily in terms of lateral, two-dimensional surface potential landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the pivotal role of vertical variations in the surface potential on the quantum confinement of surface electrons. We investigate the confinement behavior of both Shockley surface state and image potential state electrons with their distinct vertical electron density distributions in an exemplary Cu-T4PT metal-organic porous network on Cu(111). Advanced spectroscopic techniques reveal a substantial band renormalization for the image state electrons, manifested as a significant increase in their effective mass, whereas the Shockley state electrons remain almost unchanged. Such striking divergence is attributed to the distinct three-dimensional potential landscape of the Cu-T4PT network with a strong repulsive potential at the vertical position of the molecular backbone and leaky channels underneath the Cu coordination spheres. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of vertical potential engineering in designing quantum confined states and thus advance the control of electronic properties and quantum phenomena on the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a class of magnetic materials that exhibit unconventional transport properties, such as an anomalous Hall effect, despite having compensated sublattice magnetic moments. In this study, we report fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite ($\alpha$-\ch{Fe2O3}), combining electrical transport with advanced XPEEM imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. Our measurements directly visualize the N\'eel vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry-driven transport behavior. Transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific N\'eel vector alignments. Supported by first-principles theoretical calculations, we explain how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed anomalous Hall effect. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic technologies.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent discovery of BCC refractory multi-principal element alloys: Integrating deep learning and CALPHAD calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) offer potential for developing alloys with exceptional strength. However, the compositional design space is immense. Exhaustively mapping this space with conventional CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) is impractical because database coverage and run times scale poorly with millions of candidate chemistries. To address this, we train a deep-learning surrogate on CALPHAD outputs that preserves the thermodynamic fidelity while accelerating temperature-dependent phase-fraction predictions of RMPEA phases. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting phase fractions for up to eight distinct phases across different temperatures and offers a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to CALPHAD. Using this model, we screen the Ti, Fe, Al, V, Ni, Nb and Zr elemental space for potentially stable single-phase BCC alloys at different annealing temperatures and extract design insights to guide the synthesis of new BCC RMPEAs in experiments. Finally, we develop an analytical model that enables rapid, interpretable identification of single-phase BCC RMPEAs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Thermal Effects on the Current-Tunable Electrical Transport in the Ferrimagnetic Semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. First-principles calculations reveal a pronounced band gap reduction upon tilting the magnetic moments toward the $c$-axis, accompanied by increased carrier concentration and Fermi velocity. Combining spin orientation-dependent electronic structure with Boltzmann transport theory, the calculated electrical resistance closely reproduces the CMR observed experimentally. These findings suggest that the CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ stems primarily from band gap reduction induced by partial polarization of magnetic moments along the magnetic hard axis.</description>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the voltage of battery materials plays a pivotal role in the advancement of energy storage technologies and the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of specific structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery descriptors, ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and the DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework to effectively select and identify viable battery materials. Using this validated model, we successfully proposed novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed by rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken ground state and phonon mediated superconductivity in Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) provides a unique platform for exploring the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order, superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Although characterizing the CDW phase is essential for understanding and modeling these exotic phenomena, its nature remains unresolved. In this work, we employ first-principles free-energy calculations, accounting for both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results uncover that the CDW ground state is formed by reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers in a triangular hexagonal pattern, featuring energetically degenerate different stacking orders. This accounts for the various out-of-plane modulations observed experimentally and supports the coexistence of multiple domains. The discovered symmetry-broken ground state is consistent with the absence of any electronic anisotropy in transport experiments. By combining anharmonic phonons with the calculation of electron-phonon matrix elements, we predict a superconducting critical temperature for the CDW phase in agreement with experiments, showing that superconductivity is phonon mediated. These findings not only resolve a long-standing structural puzzle, but also clarify the impact of the CDW in superconductivity, highlighting its fundamental importance in shaping the low-temperature quantum phase diagram of Kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vacancy Levels in CsPbCl3 Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with VCl identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl3, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K. While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Universal Wilson Loop Bound of Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the (integrated) quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the integrated quantum metric and provides an explicit lower bound of the integrated quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</description>
