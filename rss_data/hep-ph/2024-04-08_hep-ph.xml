      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter Gravitationally with Laser Interferometers in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is one of the leading well-motivated dark matter candidates, predicted in many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics and cosmology. There have been increasing interests in searching for ULDM in physical and astronomical experiments, mostly assuming there are additional interactions other than gravity between ULDM and normal matter. Here we demonstrate that even if ULDM has only gravitational interaction, it shall induce gravitational perturbations in solar system that may be large enough to cause detectable signals in future gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers in space. We investigate the sensitivities of Michelson time-delay interferometer to ULDM of various spins, and show vector ULDM with mass $m\lesssim 10^{-18}~$eV can be probed by space-based GW detectors aiming at $\mu$Hz frequencies. Our findings exhibit that GW detectors may directly probe ULDM in some mass ranges that otherwise are challenging to examine.</description>

      <title>Invisible and Semi-invisible Decays of Bottom Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The similar densities of dark matter and baryons in the universe imply that they might arise from the same ultraviolet model. The B-Mesogenesis, which assumes dark matter is charged under the baryon number, attempts to simultaneously explain the origin of baryon asymmetry and dark matter in the universe. In particular, the B-Mesogenesis might induce bottom-baryon decays into invisible or semi-invisible final states, which provide a distinctive signal for probing this scenario. In this work, we systematically study the invisible decays of bottom baryons into dark matters, and semi-invisible decays of bottom baryons into a meson or a photon together with a dark matter particle. In particular, the fully invisible decay can explore the stable particles in B-Mesogenesis. Some QCD-based frameworks are used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements under the B-Mesogenesis model. We estimate the constraints on the Wilson coefficients or the product of some new physics couplings with the Wilson coefficients by the semi-invisible and invisible decays of bottom baryons at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Parameters of the tensor tetraquark $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass and width of the tensor tetraquark $T=bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ with spin-parity $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The tetraquark $T$ is modeled as a diquark-antidiquark state built of components $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }b$ and $\overline{c}\gamma _{\nu }C\overline{c}^{T}$ with $C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m=(12795\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the exotic tensor meson $T$ is found by means of the two-point sum rule approach. Its full width $\Gamma$ is evaluated by considering processes $T \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}$, $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. Partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the three-point sum rule approach which is used to determine the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Predictions obtained for the width $ \Gamma=(55.5 \pm 8.7)~\mathrm{MeV}$, as well as the mass of the tetraquark $ T $ can be useful in investigations of fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Boosted four-top production at the LHC : a window to Randall-Sundrum or extended color symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenarios seeking to address the issue of electroweak symmetry breaking often have heavy colored gauge bosons coupling preferentially to the top quark. Considering the bulk Randall-Sundrum as a typical example, we consider the prospects of the first Kaluza-Klein mode ($G^{(1)}$) of the gluon being produced at the LHC in association with a $t \bar{t}$ pair. The enhanced coupling not only dictates that the dominant decay mode would be to a $t \bar{t}$ pair, but also to a very large $G^{(1)}$ width, necessitating the use of a renormalised $G^{(1)}$ propagator. This, alongwith the presence of large backgrounds (specially $t \bar{t} j j$), renders a conventional cut-based analysis ineffective, yielding only marginal significances of only around 2$\sigma$. The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques alleviates this problem to a great extent. In particular, the use of Artificial Neural Networks helps us identify the most discriminating observables, thereby allowing a significance in excess of 4$\sigma$ for $G^{(1)}$ masses of $\sim$ 4 TeV.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical aspects of coherent photoproduction: the limits of coherence, and multiple vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is central to coherent photoproduction in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs). This writeup will discuss some surprising aspects of UPCs that stem from these quantum mechanical roots. The Good-Walker (GW) paradigm, which connects coherent photoproduction with the target nucleus remaining in its ground state. This contrasts with a semi-classical picture, where coherence depends on the positions of the individual nucleons and the momentum transfer. Unlike the GW approach, the semiclassical picture is consistent with the observed data on coherent photoproduction with nuclear breakup, and with coherent photoproduction in peripheral collisions. The semiclassical approach allows for a wider variety of coherent UPC reactions, such as coherent photoproduction of charged mesons, including some non $q\overline q$ exotica. Quantum mechanics is also key to the coherent photoproduction of multiple vector mesons by the interactions of a single ion pair. The vector mesons share a common impact parameter, and so can exhibit richer interference patterns than single mesons. At forward rapidities, the cross sections to produce multiple identical vector mesons are enhanced due to superradiance. With enough statistics, multi-meson events may provide an opportunity to observe stimulated decays.}</description>

      <title>On Capped Higgs Positivity Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory are subject to a series of positivity bounds. It has been shown that, while the positivity part of the UV partial wave unitarity leads to the Wilson coefficients living in a convex cone, further including the non-positivity part caps the cone from above. For the Higgs scattering, a capped positivity cone have been obtained using a simplified, linear unitarity conditions and without utilizing the full internal symmetries of the Higgs scattering. Here we further implement the stronger nonlinear unitarity conditions from the UV, which generically gives rise to better bounds. We show that, for the Higgs case in particular, while the nonlinear unitarity conditions per se do not enhance the bounds, the fuller use of the internal symmetries do shrink the capped positivity cone significantly.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \rightarrow \ K^{*}_0(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)} $ in the PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ within the perterbative QCD (PQCD) framework. The S-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) are introduced to describe the final state interactions of the $K\pi$ pair, which involve the time-like form factors and the Gegenbauer polynomials. In the calculations, we adopt two kinds of parameterization schemes to describe the time-like form factors: One is the relativistic Breit-Wigner (RBW) formula, which is usually more siutable for the narrow resonances, and the other is the LASS line shape proposed by the LASS Collaboration, which includes both the resonant and nonresonant components. We find that the branching ratios and the direct CP violations for the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)}$ obtained from those of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ under the narrow width approximation (NWA) can be consistent well with the previous PQCD results calculated in the two-body framework by assuming that $K^*_0(1430)$ being the lowest lying $\bar q s$ state, which is so-called scenario II (SII). We conclude that the LASS parameterization is more siutable to describe the $K_0^{*}(1430)$ than the RBW formula, and the nonresonant components play an important role in the branching ratios of the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$. In view of the large difference between the decay width measurements for the $K_0^{*}(1950)$ given by BaBar and LASS collaborations, we calculate the branching ratios and the CP violations for the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ by using two values, $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.100\pm0.04$ GeV and $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.201\pm0.034$ GeV, besides the two kinds of parameterizations for the resonance $K^*_0(1950)$.</description>

      <title>Solve arbitrary one-loop reduction with generating function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of generating function has been employed in one-loop reduction. For one-loop integrals encompassing arbitrary tensor ranks and higher-pole contributions, the generating function can be decomposed into a tensor part and a higher-pole part. While the tensor component has been thoroughly addressed in recent studies, there remains a lack of satisfactory investigations regarding the higher-pole part. In this work, we completely solve the problem. We first establish the partial differential equations governing the higher-pole generating function. Based on these equations, we derive an integration recursion relation and solve it iteratively. This approach enables us to explore the analytical structure of higher-pole reduction and provides a valuable tool for generating reduction coefficients efficiently.</description>

      <title>Dark photon emission in elastic proton bremsstrahlung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of dark photons with masses in range 0.4-1.5\,GeV in elastic proton bremsstrahlung. In contrast to the known approaches to calculating the bremsstrahlung cross section, we consider the non-zero momentum transfer between protons. The numerical estimates show that the refined result agrees well with the generalized Weizsacker-Williams approximation, although it significantly differs from the result obtained by Blumlein and Brunner which is widely used in proton beam-dump phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MAPPDFpol1.0, a new determination of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton from a set of longitudinally polarised inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering data. The determination includes, for the first time, next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to both processes, and is carried out in a framework that combines a neural-network parametrisation of PDFs with a Monte Carlo representation of their uncertainties. We discuss the quality of the determination, in particular its dependence on higher-order corrections, on the choice of data set, and on theoretical constraints.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $X17$ boson from IceCube searches for non-standard interactions of neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the ATOMKI anomaly with a very light $Z'$ state that features non-anomalous and non-flavour-universal vector and axial-vector couplings to all leptons. This $Z'$ comes from a theoretical framework with a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ symmetry in addition to the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and is compliant with current measurements of the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon as well as beam dump experiments. The lepton flavour structure of this model allows for $Z'$ couplings to all light neutrinos, suggesting the possibility of $Z'$-mediated Non-Standard Interactions (NSIs) of neutrinos in matter, so that measurements of the strength parameters of the NSIs can constrain the value of the couplings. We use experimental constraints on NSIs of neutrinos using older TEXONO data and newer IceCube data. The IceCube data, in particular, strongly constrain the flavour universality of the leptonic vector current. The constraints enable us to define the region of parameter space of this theoretical scenario that can be pursued in further phenomenological analyses.</description>

      <title>Polarization analysis of two baryons with various spin combinations produced in electron-positron annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a method to analyze the polarization correlations of two baryons $B_{1}\bar{B}_{2}$ with various spin combinations in the annihilation process. We established spin density matrices for arbitrary spins in standard and Cartesian forms, and demonstrated their application in the helicity formalism. This paper provides parametrization schemes for the helicity amplitudes and details the analysis of two baryons with spin combinations of (1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 3/2), and (1/2, 5/2). We also illustrated methods for determining the spin and parity of the excited baryon $\bar{\Xi}^{*+}$ using the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma^*/\psi \rightarrow \Xi^{-}\bar{\Xi}^{*+}$ process as an example. Our research offers broad opportunities for exploring the baryon spectrum and transition form factors in electron-positron annihilation.</description>

      <title>Five-body $D\to V$ Semileptonic Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main objective is to derive the decay rate for the semileptonic decays $D\to V\ell^+\nu_{\ell}\,(\ell=e,\mu)$, where $V$ represents a vector particle. In these decays, the vector particle $V$ decays into three pseudo-scalar particles. To accomplish this, we evaluate the phase-space factor for the five-body decay with a set of eight independent variables which uniquely define a point in the phase space. We further conduct a detailed investigation of the $D\to \omega\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$, where $\omega$ subsequently decays into $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, within the Standard Model and in a general effective field theory description of the weak interactions at low energies. The outcomes of this study have potential applications in the measurement of $D\to \omega$ form factors. These measurements can be performed using data obtained from BESIII.</description>

      <title>Two-photon production of $f_0$ and $a_0$ resonances as hadronic molecules composed of two vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ascribed as $\rho\rho$ and $K^* \bar{K}^*$ molecular states, respectively, iso-scalar $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ states are expected to have iso-vector partners, potentially identified as $a_0(1450)$ and $a_0(1710)$. The predicted dominant decay modes for these two $a_0$ resonances are $a_0(1450) \to \omega\pi\pi$ and $a_0(1710) \to \omega\pi\pi,\,\phi\pi\pi$. We estimate cross sections for two-photon production of these four resonances within the hadronic molecular picture, and demonstrate that SuperKEKB's luminosity is sufficient for their observation and more precise parameter measurements.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Low-Mass Gap Black Hole Echoing LVK Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

      <title>Lightcone and quasi distribution amplitudes for light octet and decuplet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of leading-twist lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) and quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) for light octet and decuplet baryons within large momentum effective theory. In LaMET, LCDAs can be factorized in terms of a hard kernel and quasi-DAs that are defined as spatial correlators and calculable on Lattice QCD. To renormalize quasi-DAs and eliminate the singular terms $\ln(\mu^2 z_i^2)'s$ in them, which undermine the efficacy in perturbative expansion, we adopt a hybrid renormalization scheme that combines the self-renormalization and ratio scheme. Through self-renormalization, we eliminate UV divergences and linear divergences at large spatial separations in quasi distribution amplitudes without introducing additional nonperturbative effects. By taking a ratio with respect to the zero-momentum matrix element, we effectively remove UV divergences at small spatial separations. Under the hybrid renormalization scheme, we calculate the hard kernels up to one-loop accuracy. It turns out that only four different hard kernels are needed for all leading-twist LCDAs of octet and decuplet baryons. These results are crucial for the lattice-based exploration of the LCDAs of a light baryon from the first principle of QCD.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Influence of the chiral magnetic effect on particle-pair elliptic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive, azimuthal correlator difference $\Delta\gamma$ between opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) charged hadron pairs is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_2$). The CME signal, on the other hand, contributes to the difference in the pair elliptic anisotropies between OS and SS pairs ($\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$). We investigate $\Delta v_{2,\rm pair}$ and found its sensitivity to CME to be similar to that of the $\Delta\gamma$ observable.</description>

      <title>Quasi-parton distributions in massive QED2: Towards quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) [\psi(2S)] \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have phenomenologically investigated the decays $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+ \pi^- (K^+K^-)$. In our analysis, the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is formed through the final state interactions of coupled channels $\pi \pi$ and $K\bar{K}$. Our findings indicate that the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be accurately reproduced. Furthermore, we have explored the $\pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decay, accounting for the different production mechanisms between $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$, up to a global factor. It is found that the production rates for $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ are much different, which indicates that the structure of $X(3872)$ is more complicated than the $\psi(2S)$, which is a conventional $c\bar{c}$ state. Additionally, we have considered the contributions from $f_0(1500)$ to $\pi^+\pi^-$ and the $\phi$ meson to $K^+ K^-$ in our analysis. Utilizing the model parameters, we have calculated the branching fraction of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) K^+ K^-$, and anticipate that the findings of our study can be experimentally tested in the future.</description>

      <title>T-odd Parton Distribution Functions and Azimuthal Anisotropy at High Transverse Momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various azimuthal anisotropies ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$), at high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$), are shown to arise from the asymmetric scattering of transverse polarized quarks and gluons, arising from unpolarized nucleons (the Boer-Mulders' effect) and resulting in unpolarized hadrons (the Collins effect). Combined with the asymmetric scattering of partons from polarization independent but transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions, we obtain a possible mechanism to understand the azimuthal anisotropy of hadrons at large transverse momentum observed in $p$-$p$ collisions. Constraining the ratio of polarization dependent TMD distributions to polarization independent distributions by comparing with the data from $p$-$p$ collisions, we find that a simple $A^{1/3}$ enhancement of the intrinsic transverse momentum $(k_\perp^2)$ distribution, of the initial state partons from the proton, straightforwardly yields the azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ in $p$-$A$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions under external magnetic field in frame of a Pauli-Villars regularized PNJL model. A running Polyakov loop scale parameter $T_0(eB)$ is introduced to mimic the reaction of the gluon sector to the presence of magnetic fields. It is found that a decreasing $T_0(eB)$ with magnetic fields can realize the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomena of chiral condensates of $u$ and $d$ quarks, increase of Polyakov loop and the reduction of (pseudo-)critical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution and dissociation dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs within the Glasma medium, resulting from the collision of ultra-relativistic heavy ions. An attractive potential is used to create the pairs, but the strong Glasma fields dominate over it, causing an increase in pair separation and subsequent dissociation. The observed finite probability of dissociation for these states reveals the intricate interplay between QCD dynamics and the suppression of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ states during the Glasma phase. The research highlights differences between $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs, revealing the role of quark flavor in the dissociation process. Dissociation spectra analysis indicates a peak shift towards higher momentum, reflecting a slight energy gain by the pairs. This investigation provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ pairs in the Glasma, which may help in better interpretation of experimental results on further integration with subsequent phases of the created matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusive production processes will be important for the first observations of $XYZ$ states at new generation electron-hadron colliders, as they generally benefit from larger cross sections than their exclusive counterparts. We make predictions of semi-inclusive photoproduction of the $\chi_{c1}(1P)$ and $X(3872)$, whose peripheral production is assumed to be dominated by vector exchanges. We validate the applicability of Vector Meson Dominance in the axial-vector charmonium sector and calculate production rates at center-of-mass energies relevant for future experimental facilities. We find the semi-inclusive cross sections near threshold to be enhanced by a factor of $\sim 2-3$ compared to the exclusive reaction and well suited for a first observation in photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of the vector tetraquark states with the masses about $4.5\,\rm{GeV}$ via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suppose that there exist three vector hidden-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ at the energy about $4.5\,\rm{GeV}$, and investigate the two-body strong decays systematically. We obtain thirty QCD sum rules for the hadronic coupling constants based on rigorous quark-hadron duality, then obtain the partial decay widths, therefore the total widths approximately, which are compatible with the experimental data of the $Y(4500)$ from the BESIII collaboration. The $Y(4500)$ may be one vector tetraquark state having three main Fock components, or consists of three different vector tetraquark states. We can search for the typical decays $ Y \to \frac{\bar{D}^0_1D^{0}-\bar{D}^{0}D^{0}_1}{\sqrt{2}}$,
  $\frac{\bar{D}^-_1D^{+}-\bar{D}^{-}D^{+}_1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\frac{\bar{D}^0_0D^{*0}-\bar{D}^{*0}D^{0}_0}{\sqrt{2}}$, $ \frac{\bar{D}^-_0D^{*+}-\bar{D}^{*-}D^{+}_0}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\eta_c\omega$, $J/\psi\omega$ to diagnose the nature of the $Y(4500)$.</description>

      <title>Dark matter phenomenology and phase transition dynamics of the next to minimal composite Higgs model with dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the Next-to-Minimal Composite Higgs Model (NMCHM) extended with a dilaton field $\chi$ (denoted as NMCHM$_\chi$). A pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) $\eta$, resulting from the SO(6)$\to$SO(5) breaking, serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. The inclusion of the dilaton field is helpful for evading the stringent constraints from dark matter direct detection, as it allows for an accidental cancellation between the amplitudes of DM-nucleon scattering, an outcome of the mixing between the dilaton and Higgs fields. The presence of the dilaton field also enriches the phase transition patterns in the early universe. We identify two types of phase transitions: (i) a 1-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) occur simultaneously, and (ii) a 2-step phase transition, where the chiral symmetry breaking transition takes place first, followed by a second phase transition corresponding to EWSB. Since the first-order phase transitions can be strong due to supercooling in our model, we also examine the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by these phase transitions. We find that these gravitational waves hold promise for detection in future space-based gravitational wave experiments, such as LISA, Taiji, BBO, and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Testing of Pythia modes to study identified particle production in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s}}$ = 7 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of particle production in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV using Pythia~8 event generator. We investigate the transverse momentum $p_T$ spectra of light charged hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$), their yield ratios ($\pi^-/\pi^+$, $K^-/K^+$ and $\bar{p}/p$), and $p_T$-differential ratios ($(K^++K^-)/(\pi^++\pi^-)$, $(\overline{p}+p)/(\pi^++\pi^-)$) and mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_\mathrm{T} \rangle$). Our analysis employs various Pythia~8 tunes (Simple, Vincia, and Dire) to explore the impact of different model configurations on particle production. We optimize a key parameter ($p_\mathrm{T}HatMin$) within each tune to achieve the best agreement between the simulated \ppt spectra and those measured by the CMS collaboration. Interestingly, we find that the optimal values for $p_\mathrm{T}HatMin$ differ between hadron species, potentially reflecting the influence of particle mass on production mechanisms. It is not possible to simultaneously and qualitatively describe both, the strangeness enhancement and collectivity in $pp$ collisions from \pythia~8. Further investigation such as final-state effects such as color ropes or junctions may require to explain these effects. These types of studies help us identify limitations in current models and refine their parameters to better explain experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Rewording theoretical predictions at colliders with vacuum amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose multiloop vacuum amplitudes as the optimal building blocks for efficiently assembling theoretical predictions at high-energy colliders. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the manifestly causal properties of the loop-tree duality (LTD) representation of a vacuum amplitude. The vacuum amplitude, acting as a kernel, encodes all the final states contributing to a given scattering or decay process through residues in the on-shell energies of the internal propagators. It also naturally implements gauge invariance and the wave function renormalisation of the external legs. This methodological approach, dubbed LTD causal unitary, leads to a novel representation of differential cross sections and decay rates that is locally free of ultraviolet and infrared singularities at all orders in perturbation theory. Unitary threshold singularities also match between different phase-space residues. Most notably, it allows us to conjecture for the first time the local functional form of initial-state collinear singularities. The fulfillment of all these properties provides a theoretical description of differential observables at colliders that is well defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first proof-of-concept application to decay processes at higher perturbative orders of LTD causal unitary, a novel methodology that exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality (LTD) and is directly well-defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time. The generation of loop- and tree-level contributions to the differential decay rates from a kernel multiloop vacuum amplitude is shown in detail, and explicit expressions are presented for selected processes that are suitable for a lightweight understanding of the method. Specifically, we provide a clear physical interpretation of the local cancellation of soft, collinear and unitary threshold singularities, and of the local renormalisation of ultraviolet singularities. The presentation is illustrated with numerical results that showcase the advantages of the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $h, Z\to e_b e_a $, and $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ are discussed in a class of general 3-3-1 models adding heavy neutral leptons and singly charged Higgs bosons to accommodate experimental data of neutrino oscillation and $(g-2)_{e_a}$ anomalies of charged leptons through the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that the models with the minimal number of inverse seesaw neutrinos can not reach the $1\sigma$ range of $(g-2)_{\mu}$ data due to the experimental upper bounds on decay rates of $(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$ and $(\mu \to e \gamma)$. Features of LFV decays are presented in detail, focusing on the regions of parameter space satisfying the $1\sigma$ ranges of $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ data.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO QCD Corrections to $ZZ$ Production in Gluon Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the complete NLO QCD corrections to loop-induced $gg \rightarrow ZZ$ production including full top-quark mass effects. The two-loop virtual corrections are obtained by combining analytic results for the massless, Higgs-mediated, and one-loop factorizable contributions with numerically computed amplitudes containing the top-quark mass. We show that the choice of subtraction scheme for the virtual contribution impacts the precision with which the virtual contribution must be evaluated in order to obtain sufficiently precise phenomenological predictions. For direct production through a massive top-quark loop, we observe that the relative NLO corrections are large. The direct massive and Higgs-mediated contributions individually increase relative to the massless production at high diboson invariant mass, but interfere destructively with each other. At the Large Hadron Collider, the NLO corrections to the gluon channel give a sizable contribution to the $pp \to ZZ+X$ cross-section at N${}^3$LO.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2HDM+$a$ model is one of the main models used in the interpretations of dark matter searches at the LHC. So far, all the 2HDM+$a$ benchmarks considered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments are limited to a type-II Yukawa sector, in which the Higgs bosons $A$, $H$, and $H^\pm$ are all constrained to be mass-degenerate and heavier than around $600 \, {\rm GeV}$. In this work, we present the first detailed study of 2HDM+$a$ models with a type-I Yukawa sector, which, for moderate values of $\tan\beta$, lift the constraints from flavour physics, allowing the extra Higgs bosons to be even lighter than the $125 \, {\rm GeV}$ Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. We discuss several benchmarks where the $A$, $H$, and $H^\pm$ states are not necessarily mass-degenerate and the signatures that arise in these models, some of which have not yet been explored at the LHC. We present the dominant channels in the studied benchmarks and the expected sensitivity in Run 2 data using truth-level analyses and discuss potential improvements in the experimental searches for Run 3.</description>

      <title>Engineering and Revealing Dirac Strings in Spinor Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has been no systematic study on the singular vector potentials associated with the monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of freedom, and the artificial gauge, and reveal that there exists a mapping between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also leads to a new way of constructing monopole harmonics. Our observation provides significant insights in quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Relativistic head-on collisions of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <title>QCD Predictions for Meson Electromagnetic Form Factors at High Momenta: Testing Factorization in Exclusive Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first lattice QCD computation of pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors, $F_M(Q^2)$, at large momentum transfer up to 10 and 28 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, respectively. Utilizing physical masses and two fine lattices, we achieve good agreement with JLab experimental results at $Q^2 \lesssim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. For $Q^2 \gtrsim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, our results provide $\textit{ab-initio}$ QCD benchmarks for the forthcoming experiments at JLab 12 GeV and future electron-ion colliders. We also test the QCD collinear factorization framework utilizing our high-$Q^2$ form factors at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, which relates the form factors to the leading Fock-state meson distribution amplitudes. Comparisons with independent lattice QCD calculations using the same framework demonstrate, within estimated uncertainties, the universality of these nonperturbative quantities.</description>

      <title>Matter in Discrete Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current knowledge.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particles Dark Matter in Coma Berenices with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) appear in many extensions of the Standard Model and are being investigated as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. One viable methodology for their detection involves the investigation of the line-like radio emissions from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, potentially originating from the radiative decay of ALPs or the conversion of ALPs in the magnetic field. In this work, we constrain the properties of ALPs using the 2-hour radio observation of Coma Berenices through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The $\rm 95\%$ upper limits of the ALP-photon coupling are calculated for the ALP decay and conversion scenarios, respectively. Note that the sensitive ALP masses for FAST range from $\sim \mu \rm eV$ to tens of $\mu \rm eV$, where ALP can explain the DM abundance naturally. However, our limits are weaker than those of the CAST helioscope, which can provide an independent and complementary check on the ALP non-detection for ground experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate the expected sensitivity on the ALP of FAST with its full designed bandwidth (70 $\rm MHz$ - 3 $\rm GHz$) for 100 hours of observation time. Our results indicate that, even with the exceptional sensitivity of the FAST, it is challenging to surpass the existing experimental constraints on ALP DM using radio observation of dSphs, unless the possible enhancements of ALP signals by compact stars in dSphs are considered.</description>

      <title>Note on Warped Compactification -- Finite Brane Potentials and Non-Hermiticity --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation from supersymmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recently proposed framework, dubbed inflation by supersymmetry breaking, to hybrid inflation by introducing a waterfall field that allows to decouple the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector from the inflation scale, while keeping intact the inflation sector and its successful predictions: naturally small slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions and absence of the pseudo-scalar companion of the inflaton, in terms of one free parameter which is the first order correction to the inflaton K\"ahler potential. During inflation, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with the inflaton being the superpartner of the goldstino, together with a massive vector that gauges the R-symmetry. Inflation arises around the maximum of the scalar potential at the origin where R-symmetry is unbroken. Moreover, a nearby minimum with tuneable vacuum energy can be accommodated by introducing a second order correction to the K\"ahler potential. The inflaton sector can also play the role of the supersymmetry breaking 'hidden' sector when coupled to the (supersymmetric) Standard Model, predicting a superheavy superparticle spectrum near the inflation scale. Here we show that the introduction of a waterfall field provides a natural way to end inflation and allows for a scale separation between supersymmetry breaking and inflation. Moreover, the study of the global vacuum describing low energy Standard Model physics can be done in a perturbative way within a region of the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the dense matter equation of state from young and cold isolated neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are the dense and highly magnetic relics of supernova explosions of massive stars. The quest to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of ultra-dense matter and thereby probe the behavior of matter inside neutron stars, is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, and comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. In this work, re-analyzing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EoS. We found that the "minimal" cooling model, failed to explain the observations, regardless the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method. The existence of these young cold neutron stars suggests that any dense matter EoS must be compatible with a fast cooling process at least in certain mass ranges, eliminating a significant portion of current EoS options according to recent meta-modelling analysis.</description>

      <title>A theoretical perspective on the almost dark galaxy Nube: exploring the fuzzy dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent astronomical observations, an almost dark galaxy, designated as Nube, has unveiled an intriguing anomaly in its stellar distribution. Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a number of novel scenarios for primordial black hole (PBH) formation have been discovered. Some of them require very minimal new physics, some others require no new ingredients besides those already present in commonly considered models, such as supersymmetry. At the same time, new strategies have emerged for detection of PBHs. For example, an observation of an orphan kilonova unaccompanied by the gravitational waves signal of merging neutron stars, but associated with a fast radio burst, could be a smoking gun of PBH dark matter. We review some new ideas for PBH formation and detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to extract the low energy behavior of physical observables from their high energy expansions, systematically calculable via the operator product expansion (OPE), in asymptotically free and mass-gapped theories. By applying the inverse Laplace transform to correlation functions, their analytic structure is modified such that low-energy information connects with high energy expansions. Furthermore, this transformation alleviates the renormalon problem, enabling a more straightforward application of the OPE compared to the OPE before the transformation. We demonstrate that the low energy limit of correlation functions can be accurately extracted using the OPE in the two dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model, serving as a first testing ground.</description>

Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (PTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of the first-order PT. I find that peak structure of the sound speed is stable against inclusion of PTs. Furthermore, while the current data cannot differentiate between a crossover and a first-order PT, it suggests an exceedingly low probability of the absence of either within the stable branch of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The neutrino background from non-jetted active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to Thermal Dark Matter Beyond the WIMP Unitarity Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general properties of the freezeout of a thermal relic. We give analytic estimates of the relic abundance for an arbitrary freezeout process, showing when instantaneous freezeout is appropriate and how it can be corrected when freezeout is slow. This is used to generalize the relationship between the dark mater mass and coupling that matches the observed abundance. The result encompasses well-studied particular examples, such as WIMPs, SIMPs, coannihilation, coscattering, inverse decays, and forbidden channels, and generalizes beyond them. In turn, this gives an approximate perturbative unitarity bound on the dark matter mass for an arbitrary thermal freezeout process. We show that going beyond the maximal masses allowed for freezeout via dark matter self-annihilations (WIMP-like, $m_{\rm DM}\gg\mathcal{O}(100~\rm TeV)$) predicts that there are nearly degenerate states with the dark matter and that the dark matter is generically metastable. We show how freezeout of a thermal relic may allow for dark matter masses up to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Global fit to $b \to c\tau\nu$ anomaly 2024 Spring breeze</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several new experimental results of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays were announced: the first result of $R_{D}$ from the LHCb Run 1 data, the first results of $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^\ast}$ from the LHCb Run 2 data, and the first result of $R_{D^\ast}$ from the Belle II collaboration. Including these new data, a global analysis still prefers the violation of the LFU between the tau and light leptons. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, LHCb, Belle, and Belle II collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.344 \pm 0.026$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.285 \pm 0.012$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics (NP). Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.3 \sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. Our updates also include; model-independent NP formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different NP scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

      <title>Responses of quark-antiquark interaction and heavy quark dynamics to magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the magnetic field generated by colliding nuclei on heavy quark-antiquark interactions and heavy quark dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). By means of hard-thermal-loop resummation technique combined with dimension-two gluon condensates, the static heavy quark potential and heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient, which incorporate both perturbative and non-perturbative interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP medium, are computed beyond the lowest Landau level approximation. We find that the imaginary part of the heavy quark potential in the magnetic field exhibits significant anisotropy. Specifically, the absolute value of the imaginary part is larger when the quark-antiquark separation is aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, compared to when it is aligned parallel to the magnetic field direction. The heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient in the magnetized QGP medium also becomes anisotropic. As the temperature rises, the influence of higher Landau levels becomes increasingly significant, resulting in a decrease in the anisotropy ratio of the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient to values even below 1. At sufficiently high temperatures, this ratio ultimately approaches 1. The non-perturbative interactions are indispensable for understanding heavy quark dynamics in the low-temperature region. We also study the response of viscous quark matter to the magnetic field and explore its implications for heavy quark potential, thermal decay widths of quarkonium states, as well as heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Photon and dilepton emission anisotropy for a magnetized quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the higher-order anisotropy coefficients $v_4$ and $v_6$ in the photon and dilepton emission from a hot magnetized quark-gluon plasma. Together with the earlier predictions for $v_2$, these results show a distinctive pattern of the anisotropy coefficients in several kinematic regimes. In the case of photon emission, nonzero coefficients $v_n$ (with even $n$) have opposite signs at small and large values of the transverse momentum (i.e., $k_T\lesssim \sqrt{|eB|}$ and $k_T\gtrsim \sqrt{|eB|}$, respectively). Additionally, the $v_n$ signs alternate with increasing $n$, and their approximate values decrease as $1/n^2$ in magnitude. The anisotropy of dilepton emission is well pronounced only at large transverse momenta and small invariant masses (i.e., when $k_T\gtrsim \sqrt{|eB|}$ and $M\lesssim \sqrt{|eB|}$). The corresponding $v_4$ and $v_6$ coefficients are of the same magnitude and show a similar alternating sign pattern with increasing $n$ as in the photon emission.</description>

      <title>Using Axion Miniclusters to Disentangle the Axion-photon Coupling and the Dark Matter Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter direct (and indirect) detection experiments usually can only determine a specific combination of a power of the coupling and the dark matter density. This is also true for axion haloscopes which are sensitive to the product $g^{2}_{a\gamma\gamma}\rho_{\rm DM}$, the combination of axion-photon coupling squared and the dark matter density. In this note we show, that in the lucky case when we intersect with a so-called axion minicluster of a suitable size, we can utilize the spectral information available in haloscopes to determine the gravitational potential of the minicluster. We can then use this to measure separately the coupling and the density of the minicluster.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Kalb-Ramond-Like-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond field is an antisymmetric, rank-two tensor field which most notably appears in the context of string theory, but has largely been unexplored in the context of cosmology. In this work, motivated by the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, and antisymmetric tensor fields that emerge in effective field theories ranging from particle physics to condensed matter, we study the primordial production of interacting massive Kalb-Ramond-like-particles (KRLPs). KRLPs contain features of both dark photon and axion models, which can be appreciated via their duality properties. While the massless non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudoscalar, and the massive non-interacting KRLP is dual to a pseudovector, the interacting massive KRLP can be distinguished from its scalar and vector counterparts. We study early-universe production of KRLPs via the freeze-in mechanism, considering a `dark photon-like' interaction, an `axion-like' interaction, and a `Higgs portal' interaction, as well as production via cosmological gravitational particle production. We find that as a dark matter candidate, KRLPs can be produced by all of the above mechanisms and account for the relic density of dark matter today for a wide range of masses. Finally, we comment on the potential to obtain both warm and cold dark matter subcomponents, and speculate on observational and experimental prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern-Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.</description>

Abstract: If the dark matter in the Universe is made of $\mu$eV axion-like particles (ALPs), then a rich phenomenology can emerge in connection to their stimulated decay into two photons. We discuss the ALP stimulated decay induced by electromagnetic radiation from Galactic radio sources. Three signatures, made by two echoes and one collinear emission, are associated with the decay, and can be simultaneously detected, offering a unique opportunity for a clear ALP identification. We derive the formalism associated with such signatures starting from first principles, and providing the relevant equations to be applied to study the ALP phenomenology. We then focus on the case of Galactic pulsars as stimulating sources and derive forecasts for future observations, which will be complementary to helioscopes and haloscopes results</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments and the interpretation of their results are sensitive to the velocity structure of the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this work, we extend the formalism that deals with such astrophysics-driven uncertainties, originally introduced in the context of dark-matter-nuclear scattering, to include dark-matter-electron scattering interactions. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the ability to determine the correct dark matter mass and velocity distribution is depleted for recoil spectra which only populate a few low-lying bins, such as models involving a light mediator. We also demonstrate how this formalism allows one to test the compatibility of existing experimental data sets (e.g. SENSEI and EDELWEISS), as well as make predictions for possible future experiments (e.g. GaAs-based detectors).</description>

      <title>CGC/saturation approach: Impact-parameter dependent model in next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD and combined HERA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we confront the next-to-leading order (NLO) CGC/saturation approach of Ref. [1] with the experimental combined HERA data and obtain its parameters. The model includes two features that are in accordance with our theoretical knowledge of deep inelastic scattering. These consist of: $i$) the use of analytical solution for the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation and $ii$) the exponential behavior of the saturation momentum on the impact parameter $b$-dependence, characterized by $Q_s$ $\propto\exp( -m b )$ which reproduce the correct behaviour of the scattering amplitude at large $b$ in accord with Froissart theorem. The model results are then compared to data at small-x for the structure function of the proton $F_{2}$, the longitudinal structure function $F_{L}$, the charm structure function $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$, the exclusive vector meson ($J/\psi,\phi,\rho$) production and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). We obtain a good agreement for the processes in a wide kinematic range of $Q^2$ at small $x$. Our results provide a strong guide for finding an approach, based on Color Glass Condensate/saturation effective theory for high energy QCD, to make reliable predictions from first principles as well as for forthcoming experiments like the Electron-Ion Collider and the LHeC.</description>

Abstract: We perform an analysis of the one- and two-loop massive quark form factor in QED in a region expansion, up to next-to-leading power in the quark mass. This yields an extensive set of regional integrals, categorized into three topologies, against which factorization theorems at next-to-leading power could be tested. Our analysis reveals a number of subtle aspects involving rapidity regulators, as well as additional regions that manifest themselves only beyond one loop, at the level of single diagrams, but which cancel in the form factor.</description>

Abstract: Off-shell effects in large LHC backgrounds are crucial for precision predictions and, at the same time, challenging to simulate.

      <title>Probing the Interactions of Axion-Like Particles with Electroweak Bosons and the Higgs Boson in the High Energy Regime at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interactions of Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) with the Standard Model particles, aiming to probe their phenomenology via non-resonant searches at the LHC. These interactions are mediated by higher dimensional effective operators within two possible frameworks of linearly and non-linearly realised electroweak symmetry breaking. We consider the ALPs to be light enough to be produced on-shell and exploit their derivative couplings with the SM Higgs boson and the gauge bosons. We will use the high momentum transfer processes, namely $hZ, Z\gamma, WW$ and $WW\gamma$ production from $pp$ collisions. We derive upper limits on the gauge-invariant interactions of ALPs with the electroweak bosons and/or Higgs boson that contribute to these processes, from the re-interpretation of the latest Run 2 available LHC data. The constraints we obtain are strong for ALP masses below 100 GeV. These allowed effective interactions in the ALP parameter space yield better significance at HL-LHC and thus, offer promising avenues for subsequent studies. Furthermore, we augment our cut-based analysis with gradient-boosted decision trees, which improve the statistical significance distinctly across these interaction channels. We briefly compare the results with the complementary probe of these couplings via direct production of ALPs in association with the Higgs boson or a vector boson.</description>

      <title>Leptonic signatures of color-sextet scalars II: Exploiting unique large-$E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ signals at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diverse and distinct collider phenomenology of color-sextet scalars motivates thorough investigation of their effective couplings to the Standard Model at the LHC. Some of the more unique sextet signals involve not only jets but also leptons. In previous work, we proposed an LHC search for color-sextet scalars in a channel with jets and a hard opposite-sign lepton pair, which results from a dimension-six coupling. In this sequel we study the counterpart processes with neutrinos, which produce jets in association with missing transverse energy ($E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$) in addition to possible leptons. We consider multiple search channels, including both single and pair sextet production, all characterized by significant missing energy and some featuring distinctive kinematic features. Our multifaceted study consists of three reinterpreted existing searches and a joint-likelihood analysis designed by us to maximize HL-LHC sensitivity to single sextet production. We show that our dedicated strategy in the jets + lepton + $E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ channel can supersede today's limits from reinterpreted searches, and we make sensitivity projections for the HL-LHC. Altogether, our analysis can exclude sextet scalars lighter than 4.4 TeV or probe effective cutoffs as high as 16.8 TeV.</description>

Abstract: The increasingly precise neutrino experiments raise the hope for searching for new physics through studying the impact of Neutral Current (NC) Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter fields. Neutrino oscillation experiments along with the Elastic Coherent $\nu$ Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experiments already set strong bounds on all the flavor elements of the "vector" NC NSI. However, "axial" NC NSI can hide from these experiments. We show how a DUNE-like experiment can probe these couplings by studying NC Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) events. We find that strong bounds can be set on the axial NC NSI of neutrinos with the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. We show that using both the near and far detectors, a DUNE-like experiment can significantly improve the present bounds on all the flavor elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Short-Baseline Neutrino program in Fermilab aims to resolve the nature of the low-energy excess events observed in LSND and MiniBooNE, and analyze with unprecedented precision neutrino interactions with argon. These studies require reliable estimate of neutrino cross sections, in particular for charged current quasielastic scattering (CCQE). Here, we report updates of the NuWro Monte Carlo generator that, most notably, bring the state-of-the-art spectral functions to model the ground state properties of the argon nucleus, and improve the accuracy of the cross sections at low energies by accounting for the effects of the nuclear Coulomb potential. We discuss these developments in the context of electron and neutrino interactions, by comparing updated NuWro predictions to experimental data from Jefferson Laboratory Hall A and MicroBooNE. The MicroBooNE CCQE data are described with the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom of 0.7, compared with 1.0 in the local Fermi gas model. The largest improvement is observed for the angular distributions of the produced protons, where the $\chi^2$ reduces nearly by half. Being obtained using the axial form factor parametrization from MINERvA, our results indicate a~consistency between the CCQE measurements in MINERvA and MicroBooNE.</description>

      <title>NICA prospects in searches for light exotics from hidden sectors: the cases of hidden photons and axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present first estimates of NICA sensitivity to Standard Model extensions with light hypothetical particles singlet under the known gauge transformations. Our analysis reveals that NICA can explore new regions in the parameter spaces of models with a hidden vector and models with an axion-like particle of masses about 30-500\,MeV. Some of these regions seem unreachable by other ongoing and approved future projects. NICA has good prospects in discovery ($5\sigma$) of the new physics after 1 year of data taking.</description>

      <title>Long-lived doubly charged scalars in the left-right symmetric model: catalyzed nuclear fusion and collider implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the doubly charged scalar from the $SU(2)_R$-triplet Higgs field in the Left-Right Symmetric Model has its mass governed by a hidden symmetry so that its value can be much lower than the $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale. This makes it a long-lived particle while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. Such long-lived doubly charged scalars have the potential to trigger catalyzed fusion processes in light nuclei, which may have important applications for energy production. We show that it could also bear consequences on the excess of large ionization energy loss ($dE/dx$) recently observed in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Matrix Element Corrections in top quark decays for the ttW process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method that allows enabling Matrix Element Corrections (MECs) in Pythia8 with MC@NLO matching, without incurring double counting. MECs are an interesting feature that may contribute to the accuracy of theoretical predictions, alongside matching and merging. We directly compare our method to a specific choice of settings in Pythia8, which can remove double-counting for MECs in certain processes. We show results by taking the ttW process as an example. This choice allows us to study the impact of decay MECs in the 2SSl and 3l final states. We find that jet-related observables receive these corrections unevenly throughout the phase space. They can contribute up to $\pm 6\% in certain regions.</description>

      <title>Probing new physics with polarization components of the tau lepton in quasielastic $e^- p \to \Lambda_c \tau^-$ scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinematics restrict the ability of rare charm decays to explore the charged Lepton Flavor Violation processes mediated by the quark-level $c\to u \ell \tau$ transition. To fill the gap, we propose exploring new physics (NP) through the quasielastic scattering process $e^-p\to \tau^-\Lambda_c$ and the polarization of the $\tau$ lepton. As analyzing modes for the $\tau$ polarization, we consider the decays $\tau^-\to \pi^-\nu_{\tau}$, $\tau^-\to \rho^-\nu_{\tau}$, and $\tau^- \to \ell^-\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\nu_{\tau}$, and show that the $\tau$ polarization components can be extracted from analyzing the kinematics of the $\tau$ visible decay products. In the framework of a general low-energy effective Lagrangian, we then perform a detailed analysis of the polarization components in various aspects and scrutinize possible NP signals. With one upcoming experimental setup, we finally demonstrate promising event rate can be expected for the cascade process and, even in the worst-case scenario -- no signals is observed at all -- it can still provide a competitive potential for constraining the NP, compared with those from the high-$p_T$ dilepton invariant mass tails at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Probing sterile neutrino freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regime of dark matter (DM) freeze-in at stronger coupling interpolates between freeze-in and freeze-out. It relies on Boltzmann-suppressed dark matter production, implying that the Standard Model bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. In this work, we study this regime in the context of sterile neutrino dark matter, which can be sufficiently long-lived for a tiny sterile-active mixing. The sterile neutrino is assumed to couple to a real singlet scalar, providing for a thermal production mechanism of the former. We find that DM mass can range from GeV to tens of TeV consistently with all the constraints. The most interesting aspect of the consequent freeze-in phenomenology is that the sterile neutrino dark matter can be probed efficiently by both direct detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An outstanding mystery of dark matter physics is the lack of direct detection signals to date. We suggest that dark matter is scatophobic: due to a repulsive long-range interaction, it is repelled by objects with a large net scat charge, such as the Earth, and is therefore not able to reach direct detection experiments. This represents the first step in a broader theoretical paradigm that we dub the "anti-anthropic principle."</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present that by predicting the spectrum in discrete space from the phase shift in continuous space, the neural network can remarkably reproduce the numerical L\"uscher's formula to a high precision. The model-independent property of the L\"uscher's formula is naturally realized by the generalizability of the neural network. This exhibits the great potential of the neural network to extract model-independent relation between model-dependent quantities, and this data-driven approach could greatly facilitate the discovery of the physical principles underneath the intricate data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Majorana transformation makes it possible to reduce the Thomas-Fermi equation to a first-order differential equation. This reduction is possible due to the special scaling property of the Thomas-Fermi equation under homology transformations. Such reductions are well known in the context of stellar astrophysics, where the use of homology-invariant variables has long proved useful. We use homology-invariant variables in the context of the Thomas-Fermi equation to demystify the origin of the otherwise mysterious Majorana transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies are ideal targets in the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signals. In this work, we analyze MUSE spectroscopic observations of a sample of five galaxies, composed of both classical and ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals. The goal is to search for radiative decays of axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range of 2.7-5.3 eV. After taking into account the uncertainties associated with the DM spatial distribution in the galaxies, we derive robust bounds on the effective ALP-two-photon coupling. They lie well below the QCD axion band and are significantly more constraining than limits from other probes, in the relevant mass range. We also test the possible presence of a positive signal, concluding that none of the channels selected for this analysis, i.e., not affected by large background contamination, is exhibiting such evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the nature of gravity, non-linear effects are left imprinted in the quasi-normal modes generated in the ringdown phase of the merger of two black holes. We offer an analytical treatment of the quasi-normal modes at second-order in black hole perturbation theory which takes advantage from the fact that the non-linear sources are peaked around the light ring. As a byproduct, we describe why the amplitude of the second-order mode relative to the square of the first-order amplitude depends only weakly on the initial condition of the problem.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we study the possible production of the heavy neutral dark gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) candidates, which originated from a simplified model based on the Einstein-Cartan gravity, in association with dark matter. This study has been performed by studying events with dimuon plus missing transverse energy produced in the simulated proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, at 13.6 TeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 52 fb$^{-1}$ corresponding to the LHC RUN III circumstances. We provide upper limits, in case no new physics has been discovered, on the masses for various particles in the model as, spin-1 (A$^{\prime}$), as well as the heavy mediator (torsion field).</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave populations and cosmology with neural posterior estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply neural posterior estimation for fast-and-accurate hierarchical Bayesian inference of gravitational wave populations. We use a normalizing flow to estimate directly the population hyper-parameters from a collection of individual source observations. This approach provides complete freedom in event representation, automatic inclusion of selection effects, and (in contrast to likelihood estimation) without the need for stochastic samplers to obtain posterior samples. Since the number of events may be unknown when the network is trained, we split into sub-population analyses that we later recombine; this allows for fast sequential analyses as additional events are observed. We demonstrate our method on a toy problem of dark siren cosmology, and show that inference takes just a few minutes and scales to $\sim 600$ events before performance degrades. We argue that neural posterior estimation therefore represents a promising avenue for population inference with large numbers of events.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking due to multi-angle matter-neutrino resonance in neutron star merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star merger remnants are unique sites for exploring neutrino flavor conversion in dense media. Because of the natural excess of $\bar{\nu}_e$ over $\nu_e$, the neutrino-neutrino potential can cancel the matter potential, giving rise to matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion. Under the assumption of two (anti)neutrino flavors and spatial homogeneity, we solve the neutrino quantum kinetic equations to investigate the occurrence of the matter-neutrino resonance within a multi-angle framework. We find that isotropy is broken spontaneously, regardless of the mass ordering. Relying on a hydrodynamical simulation of a binary neutron star merger remnant with a black hole of $3\ M_\odot$ and an accretion torus of $0.3\ M_\odot$, we find that complete flavor conversion caused by the matter-neutrino resonance is unlikely, although the matter and neutrino potentials cancel at various locations above the disk. Importantly, the matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion crucially depends on the shape of the neutrino angular distributions. Our findings suggest that an accurate modeling of the neutrino angular distributions is necessary to understand flavor conversion physics in merger remnants, its implications on the disk physics and synthesis of the elements heavier than iron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights to the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Black Hole Formation -- Null Geodesic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of $K^\ast$ induced by strange-baryon density inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The difference between the spin alignments of $K^\ast$ and those of $\phi$ at the low collision energies is a puzzle raised by the recent experiments. Unlike $\phi$ meson, $K^\ast$, carrying a unit strange charge, should react to strange chemical potential $\mu_S$. In this paper, we shall first convince you that $\mu_S$ is not small in a brayon-rich medium for keeping strange neutrality, and then derive the spin alignment induced by the gradient of $\mu_S$, and hence of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, using linear response theory, with the transport coefficients expressed, without any approximation, in terms of the $K^\ast$'s in-medium spectral properties by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. It turns out that such an effect applies mainly to the particles whose longitudinal and transverse modes diverge, and induces only the local spin alignment in a static medium. The magnitudes of these coefficients will be further estimated under the quasi-particle approximation.</description>
