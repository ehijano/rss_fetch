      <title>KOALA, a new ATLAS9 database -- I. Model atmospheres, opacities, fluxes, bolometric corrections, magnitudes and colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the KOALA database, a new set of LTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres calculated with the code ATLAS9, together with the corresponding Opacity Distribution Functions and emergent fluxes. The latter were used also to calculated G-band bolometric corrections and theoretical magnitudes and colours for several photometric systems, i.e. UBVRI, 2MASS, Hypparcos-Tycho, SDSS, Galex, Euclid and Gaia DR3. With respect to the previous grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we adopted the solar mixture by Caffau/Lodders and we extend the sampling in metallicity (from -5.0 to -2.5 dex with step of 0.5 dex, and from -2.5 dex to +0.5 dex with step of 0.25 dex) and in [alfa/Fe] (from -0.4 to +0.4 dex with a step of 0.2 dex). Also, we provide a finer sampling in Teff for Teff lower than 7000 K. This finer grid allows for more accurate interpolation of colours and in many cases it makes not necessary to compute a new model atmosphere, since one of the grid can be used directly. A total of 51663 model atmospheres and emergent fluxes have been computed. Finally, we discuss the impact of [M/H] and [alfa/Fe] on the thermal and pressure structures of the model atmospheres and on theoretical colours.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous high-frequency waves and disturbances in the active region corona observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma of the solar corona harbors a multitude of coronal wave modes, some of which could be dissipated to provide the required energy and momentum to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. We present observations of the corona acquired with the newly commissioned infrared slit spectropolarimeter Cryo-NIRSP at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), Haleakala, Hawaii to study the high frequency wave behavior in closed, active-region structures. Cryo-NIRSP observes the corona off the limb in the Fe XIII 1074 and 1079 nm forbidden atomic lines. The large aperture of DKIST allows us to explore the active region corona with temporal resolution faster than a second with an achieved spatial resolution of 2-5 arcseconds. Enhanced wave power is observed in the power spectra up to 100 mHz. Furthermore, we report on a statistically significant anti-correlation between the Fe XIII 1074 nm peak line intensity and line width in our data, possibly pointing to the presence of compressive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes. These observations show how the powerful spectropolarimetric capabilities of DKIST offer great promise for furthering our knowledge of coronal MHD waves.</description>

      <title>In situ Evidence of 5-minute Oscillations from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's surface vibrates in characteristic 5-minute oscillations, known as p-modes, generated by sound waves trapped within the convection zone. Although these oscillations have long been hypothesized to reach into the solar wind, direct in situ evidence has remained elusive, even during previous close encounters by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Here, we present the first promising in situ detection of 5-minute oscillations in the upper solar corona, based on observations from PSP's three closest perihelia. In two events at 9.9 solar radii, we identify statistically significant ($\sim$ 6 $\sigma$) 3.1-3.2 mHz peaks in the magnetic field power spectrum, each appearing as a large-amplitude, spherically polarized Alfv\'enic wave train lasting approximately 35 minutes. These results demonstrate that global solar oscillations can reach and potentially influence the solar wind.</description>

      <title>SPICE -- modelling synthetic spectra of stars with non-homogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large time-domain spectro-photometric surveys, surface variations such as starspots, chemical inhomogeneities, pulsations, rotational distortions, and binary interactions can now be directly detected and modelled. Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies.</description>

      <title>Empirical prediction of plasma emission measure distributions and X-EUV spectra of late-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy emission spectra from the outer atmospheres of late-type stars represent an important feature of the stellar activity in several contexts, such as the photoevaporation and photochemistry of planetary atmospheres or the modeling of irradiated circumstellar disks in young objects. An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below ~10^5 K and higher emission measures for T &gt; ~10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Keplerian orbit of a close companion around a giant star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close companions influence stellar evolution through tidal interactions, mass transfer, and mass loss effects. While such companions are detected around young stellar objects, main-sequence stars, red giants, and compact objects, direct observational evidence of close-in companions around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has remained elusive. Here, we present (sub)millimeter time-domain imaging spectroscopy revealing the Keplerian motion of a close-in companion around the AGB star pi1 Gruis. The companion, slightly more massive than the AGB star, is likely a main-sequence star. Unlike more evolved stars with companions at comparable distances, pi1 Gru's companion follows a circular orbit, suggesting an eccentricity-generating mechanism late- or post-AGB. Our analysis suggests that model-predicted circularization rates may be underestimated. Our results highlight the potential of multi-epoch (sub)millimeter interferometry in detecting the Keplerian motion of close companions to giant stars and open avenues for our understanding of tidal interaction physics and binary evolution.</description>

      <title>An optical--mid-infrared color evolution tool for nova identification using WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for characterizing nova candidates by exploiting the infrared capabilities of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog. We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.</description>

      <title>Widening of Binaries via Non-conservative Mass Transfer as a Formation Channel for Gaia Black Hole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>XSNAP: An X-ray Supernova Analysis Pipeline with Application to the Type II Supernova 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of Type II supernovae (SNe II) probe the physics of supernova (SN) shocks and the mass-loss histories of their progenitor stars. We present multi-epoch, X-ray observations of SN II 2024ggi ($D \approx 7.2 \ \rm Mpc$) from ${\it Swift}$-XRT, ${\it Chandra}$ and ${\it XMM}$, which cover $\sim 1 - 344$ days since first light. We analyze these observations using a new open-source Python package called $\texttt{XSNAP}$, which standardizes a unified command-line interface for instrument-specific reduction and spectral extraction. $\texttt{XSNAP}$ introduces application programming interfaces for per-epoch spectral modeling through $\texttt{PyXspec}$ and $\texttt{emcee}$ Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. We employ ${\tt XSNAP}$ to model the multi-epoch X-ray spectra of SN 2024ggi with an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model and calculate a steady progenitor mass-loss rate of $(6.2\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ $(v_{\rm wind} = 20 \ \rm km \ s^{-1})$, for which the detected X-ray emission traces the final 117 years before explosion. The software is publicly available on GitHub, with a released package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys -- the Mock Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Applicability of the Hartle-Thorne and Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu Methods for Modeling Rotating Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10996</link>

Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Induced Warps in Protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $\alpha \sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.</description>

      <title>Star clusters in the gamma-ray sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</title>

Abstract: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We explore attention maps, linking the transformer's learned behaviour to line-formation physics.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) plays a critical role in astrophysical processes from galaxy evolution to the formation of planets. While the dominant formation channel in the interstellar medium is considered as dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, this process could become inefficient at low temperatures suppressed by the Boltzmann factor. This work demonstrates that quantum tunneling can dominate the formation of H$_2$, resolving the long-standing problem of formation efficiency. Path integral Monte Carlo simulations reveals that the quantum tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains stable reaction rates at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations further indicate that the actual H$_2$ formation efficiency is governed not by atomic diffusion, but rather by the energy barriers associated with chemisorption, desorption, and the association of two hydrogen atoms. These findings establish a robust physical basis for dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, offer quantitative reaction rates for refining astrophysical models, and provide a framework for interpreting observations of interstellar molecular materials.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>
