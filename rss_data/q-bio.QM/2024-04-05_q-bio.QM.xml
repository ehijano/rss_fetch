      <title>Riemannian L-systems: Modeling growing forms in curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past 50 years, the formalism of L-systems has been successfully used and developed to model the growth of filamentous and branching biological forms. These simulations take place in classical 2-D or 3-D Euclidean spaces. However, various biological forms actually grow in curved, non-Euclidean, spaces. This is for example the case of vein networks growing within curved leaf blades, of unicellular filaments, such as pollen tubes, growing on curved surfaces to fertilize distant ovules, of teeth patterns growing on folded epithelia of animals, of diffusion of chemical or mechanical signals at the surface of plant or animal tissues, etc. To model these forms growing in curved spaces, we thus extended the formalism of L-systems to non-Euclidean spaces. In a first step we show that this extension can be carried out by integrating concepts of differential geometry in the notion of turtle geometry. We then illustrate how this extension can be applied to model and program the development of both mathematical and biological forms on curved surfaces embedded in our Euclidean space. We provide various examples applied to plant development. We finally show that this approach can be extended to more abstract spaces, called abstract Riemannian spaces, that are not embedded into any higher space, while being intrinsically curved. We suggest that this abstract extension can be used to provide a new approach for effective modeling of tropism phenomena and illustrate this idea on a few conceptual examples.</description>

      <title>Drug-target interaction prediction by integrating heterogeneous information with mutual attention network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of drug-target interactions is an indispensable part of drug discovery. While conventional shallow machine learning and recent deep learning methods based on chemogenomic properties of drugs and target proteins have pushed this prediction performance improvement to a new level, these methods are still difficult to adapt to novel structures. Alternatively, large-scale biological and pharmacological data provide new ways to accelerate drug-target interaction prediction. Here, we propose DrugMAN, a deep learning model for predicting drug-target interaction by integrating multiplex heterogeneous functional networks with a mutual attention network (MAN). DrugMAN uses a graph attention network-based integration algorithm to learn network-specific low-dimensional features for drugs and target proteins by integrating four drug networks and seven gene/protein networks, respectively. DrugMAN then captures interaction information between drug and target representations by a mutual attention network to improve drug-target prediction. DrugMAN achieves the best prediction performance under four different scenarios, especially in real-world scenarios. DrugMAN spotlights heterogeneous information to mine drug-target interactions and can be a powerful tool for drug discovery and drug repurposing.</description>

      <title>DiffFit: Visually-Guided Differentiable Fitting of Molecule Structures to Cryo-EM Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DiffFit, a differentiable algorithm for fitting protein atomistic structures into experimental reconstructed Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) volume map. This process is essential in structural biology to semi-automatically reconstruct large meso-scale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. Current approaches require manual fitting in 3D that already results in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. With our DiffFit approach, we enable domain scientists to automatically fit new structures and visualize the fitting results for inspection and interactive revision. Our fitting begins with differentiable 3D rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates, followed by sampling the density values at its atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we propose a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. Such loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring both fitting accuracy and improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found its quality to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases. First, we demonstrate its use in the process of automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes. Second, we show that it facilitates the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in the identification of unknown proteins. We open-sourced (github.com/nanovis/DiffFitViewer) DiffFit as a plugin in ChimeraX. All supplemental materials are available at osf.io/5tx4q.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Gyral Size, Brain Size, and Head Impact Risk across Mammalian Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study on primates has established that gyral size is largely independent of overall brain size. Building on this, and other research suggesting that brain gyrification may mitigate the effects of head impacts, our study aims to explore potential correlations between gyral size and the risk of head impact across a diverse range of mammalian species. Our findings corroborate the idea that gyral sizes are largely independent of brain sizes, especially among species with larger brains, thus extending this observation beyond primates. Preliminary evidence also suggests a correlation between an animal's gyral size and its lifestyle, particularly in terms of head-impact risk. For instance, goats, known for their headbutting behaviors, exhibit smaller gyral sizes. In contrast, species such as manatees and dugongs, which typically face lower risks of head impact, have lissencephalic brains. Additionally, we explore mechanisms that may explain how narrower gyral sizes could offer protective advantages against head impact. Finally, we discuss a possible trade-off associated with gyrencephaly.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Different Birds of Prey as a Random Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Coulomb gas is a one-parameter family of random point processes, depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$. Based on previous work, it is proposed as a simple statistical measure to quantify the intra- and interspecies repulsion among three different highly territorial birds of prey. Using data from the area of the Teutoburger Wald over 20 years, we fit the nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions between the respective nests of Goshawk, Eagle Owl and the previously examined Common Buzzard to $\beta$ of the Coulomb gas. Within each species, the repulsion measured in this way deviates significantly from the Poisson process of independent points in the plane. In contrast, the repulsion amongst each of two species is found to be considerably lower and closer to Poisson. Methodologically we investigate the influence of the terrain, of a shorter interaction range given by the two-dimensional Yukawa interaction, and the statistical independence of the time moving average we use for the yearly ensembles of occupied nests. We also check that an artificial random displacement of the original nest positions of the order of the mean level spacing quickly destroys the repulsion measured by $\beta&gt; 0$. A simple, approximate analytical expression for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution derived from non-Hermitian random matrix theory proves to be very useful.</description>
