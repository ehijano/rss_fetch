      <title>My Favorite Math Jokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years, I have been collecting math jokes and posting them on my website. I have more than 400 jokes there. In this paper, which is an extended version of my talk at the G4G15, I would like to present 66 of them.</description>

      <title>The legacy of Bletchley Park on UK mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second world war saw a major influx of mathematical talent into the areas of cryptanalysis and cryptography. This was particularly true at the UK's Government Codes and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park. The success of introducing mathematical thinking into activities previously dominated by linguists is well-studied, but the reciprocal question of how the cryptologic effort affected the field of mathematics has been less investigated. Although their cryptologic achievements are not as celebrated as those of Turing, Tutte and Welchman, Bletchley Park's effort was supplemented by more eminent mathematicians, and those who would achieve eminence and provide leadership and direction for mathematical research in the United Kingdom. Amongst their number were Ian Cassels, Sandy Green, Philip Hall, Max Newman and Henry Whitehead. This paper considers how the experience of these and other mathematicians at Bletchley Park may have informed and influenced the mathematics that was produced in their post-war careers.</description>
