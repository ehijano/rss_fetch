      <title>Framing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Through Physics-Based Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04219</link>

Abstract: There is a substantial curricular overlap between calculus and physics, yet introductory physics students often struggle to connect the two. We introduce a quantity-based framing of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) to help unify learning across both disciplines. We propose a consistent approach to teaching definite integrals, including shared vocabulary and symbolism, to help students recognize how concepts like change, rate, and accumulation show up in both calculus and physics. We argue that the typical interpretation of the FTC in calculus, focusing on antiderivatives in closed form, doesn't align well with how physicists use or conceptualize integration. We advocate for an additional focus on Riemann sums and the underlying ideas of change, rate, products, and accumulation, which are fundamental in both fields. This approach can help students build a deeper, more coherent understanding of both mathematics and physics quantity. By aligning learning objectives across the disciplines, we argue that students can develop a stronger understanding of foundational mathematical principles.</description>
