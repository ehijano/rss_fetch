      <title>Efficient Lattice QCD Computation of Radiative-Leptonic-Decay Form Factors at Multiple Positive and Negative Photon Virtualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work Phys. Rev. D 107, 074507 (2023), we showed that form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons can be determined efficiently and with high precision from lattice QCD using the ``3d method,'' in which three-point functions are computed for all values of the current-insertion time and the time integral is performed at the data-analysis stage. Here, we demonstrate another benefit of the 3d method: the form factors can be extracted for any number of nonzero photon virtualites from the same three-point functions at no extra cost. We present results for the $D_s\to\ell\nu\gamma^*$ vector form factor as a function of photon energy and photon virtuality, for both positive and negative virtuality. In our analysis, we separately consider the two different time orderings and the different quark flavors in the electromagnetic current. We discuss in detail the behavior of the unwanted exponentials contributing to the three-point functions, as well as the choice of fit models and fit ranges used to remove them for various values of the virtuality. While positive photon virtuality is relevant for decays to multiple charged leptons, negative photon virtuality suppresses soft contributions and is of interest in QCD-factorization studies of the form factors.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, a valence pion mass of 690 MeV, and high levels of gauge link smearing. Despite the physics effects of the large-pion mass and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chiral Fermion without Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our review of the lattice chiral fermion delves into some critical areas of lattice field theory. By abandoning Hermiticity, the non-Hermitian formulation circumvents the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem while maintaining chiral symmetry, a novel approach. Comparing the Wilson and overlap fermions gives insight into how lattice formulations handle chiral symmetry. The Wilson fermion explicitly breaks chiral symmetry to eliminate doublers. In contrast, the overlap fermion restores a modified form of chiral symmetry using the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We investigate how the (1+1)D Wilson fermion relates to the (1+1)D overlap fermion in the Hamiltonian formulation. This connection could provide a clearer physical understanding of how chiral symmetry manifests at the lattice level. Depending on Hermiticity for efficiency, Monte Carlo methods face unique challenges in a non-Hermitian setting. We investigate how to correctly apply this method to non-Hermitian lattice fermions, which is essential for practical simulations. Finally, the review of topological charge is crucial, as topological features in lattice formulations are strongly connected to chiral symmetry, anomalies, and the index theorem.</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>
