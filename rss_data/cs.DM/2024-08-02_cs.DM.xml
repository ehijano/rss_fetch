      <title>Identifying the Hierarchical Emotional Areas in the Human Brain Through Information Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain basis of emotion has consistently received widespread attention, attracting a large number of studies to explore this cutting-edge topic. However, the methods employed in these studies typically only model the pairwise relationship between two brain regions, while neglecting the interactions and information fusion among multiple brain regions$\unicode{x2014}$one of the key ideas of the psychological constructionist hypothesis. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, this study provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of how to maximize interactions and information fusion among brain regions. Building on the results of this analysis, we propose to identify the hierarchical emotional areas in the human brain through multi-source information fusion and graph machine learning methods. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the identified hierarchical emotional areas, from lower to higher levels, primarily facilitate the fundamental process of emotion perception, the construction of basic psychological operations, and the coordination and integration of these operations. Overall, our findings provide unique insights into the brain mechanisms underlying specific emotions based on the psychological constructionist hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities Made Simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative, simple method to prove isoperimetric inequalities over the hypercube. In particular, we show:
  1. An elementary proof of classical isoperimetric inequalities of Talagrand, as well as a stronger isoperimetric result conjectured by Talagrand and recently proved by Eldan and Gross.
  2. A strengthening of the Friedgut junta theorem, asserting that if the $p$-moment of the sensitivity of a function is constant for some $1/2 + \varepsilon\leq p\leq 1$, then the function is close to a junta. In this language, Friedgut's theorem is the special case that $p=1$.</description>

      <title>On Completely Edge-Independent Spanning Trees in Locally Twisted Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A network can contain numerous spanning trees. If two spanning trees $T_i,T_j$ do not share any common edges, $T_i$ and $T_j$ are said to be pairwisely edge-disjoint. For spanning trees $T_1, T_2, ..., T_m$, if every two of them are pairwisely edge-disjoint, they are called completely edge-independent spanning trees (CEISTs for short). CEISTs can facilitate many network functionalities, and constructing CEISTs as maximally allowed as possible in a given network is a worthy undertaking. In this paper, we establish the maximal number of CEISTs in the locally twisted cube network, and propose an algorithm to construct $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ CEISTs in $LTQ_n$, the $n$-dimensional locally twisted cube. The proposed algorithm has been actually implemented, and we present the outputs. Network broadcasting in the $LTQ_n$ was simulated using $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ CEISTs, and the performance compared with broadcasting using a single tree.</description>

      <title>Exploring the space of graphs with fixed discrete curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>
