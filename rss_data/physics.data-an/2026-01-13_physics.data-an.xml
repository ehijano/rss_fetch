      <title>Learning to bin: differentiable and Bayesian optimization for multi-dimensional discriminants in high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categorizing events using discriminant observables is central to many high-energy physics analyses. Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections. Both methods are released as lightweight Python plugins intended for straightforward integration into existing analyses.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Tree Search for High-Dimensional Computational Design</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12538</link>

Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.</description>
