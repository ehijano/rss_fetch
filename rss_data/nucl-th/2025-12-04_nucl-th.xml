      <title>Astrophysical Reaction Rates for Charged-Particle Induced Reactions on Proton-Rich Nuclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical reaction rates for reactions with proton-rich nuclides from stability to the proton dripline were calculated with an updated version of the SMARAGD statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) code. Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>Initial state and evolution of hot and dense medium produced in isobaric collisions at 200A GeV at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isobaric collisions provide a unique opportunity to investigate how variations in the charge to mass ratio affect the final state observables produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Most importantly, isobaric systems that differ in their nuclear structure offer valuable insights into the underlying nuclear geometries, making them powerful tools to probe the role of nuclear structure using heavy ion collisions. We study the initial state and evolution of the hot and dense medium formed in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at 200A GeV at RHIC using a relativistic hydrodynamical model. The initial geometry of the two isobaric collisions is found to influence the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced. The sensitivity of photon production, charged particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) to the initial geometry, including different orientations of the isobaric set have been studied in detail. Significant variations in anisotropic flow of photons and hadrons are observed, highlighting the role of nuclear deformation in shaping final state observables. Moreover, photon anisotropic flow is found to be considerably more sensitive to the initial state than charged particle anisotropic flow, indicating that photon measurements in isobaric collisions have strong potential to constrain initial state modeling and improve our understanding of QGP properties in such systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of octupole deformation on the nuclear electromagnetic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Properties of giant dipole resonances (GDRs), along with other nuclear resonances, provide valuable tools for refining theoretical models as they reflect collective features of nuclear matter. Among such collective phenomena is octupole deformation, whose impact on resonance features, however, is less studied. Purpose: Investigate the effect of reflection-symmetry-breaking octupole deformation on electric and magnetic transition strengths in atomic nuclei. Methods: Calculations were performed using linear response theory with the iterative finite amplitude method (FAM) to solve quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA)-type equations. Underlying ground-state solutions were obtained within the framework of axially symmetric Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) using three different Skyrme functionals. Results: Electric and magnetic multipole responses were calculated for octupole-deformed even-even Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu, and Cm isotopes. Calculations were performed on top of two distinct deformed ground-state solutions: one constrained to conserve parity, and the other allowing parity breaking. Sum rules were calculated from $M1$ transition strengths and compared with the expected correlations to certain ground-state properties. Conclusions: Based on our results, the octupole deformation has only a modest effect on the transition strengths in the resonances. In turn, $M1$ transition strengths have a greater effect at lower energies (0-8 MeV), which encourages further investigation. Isoscalar $E3$ transition strength was confirmed to have a significant contribution from the rotational Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode in the parity-breaking HFB solution, and thus, removing it was found necessary.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beth--Uhlenbeck entropy formula from the $\Phi-$derivable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the entropy of a dense fermion system with strong two-particle correlations, including scattering states and bound states. We work within the $\Phi-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to na\"{i}ve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a "squared Lorentzian" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $\Phi$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $\Phi$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Perspective On King Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopic measurements of isotope shifts have recently reached a high level of accuracy. Tests of King non-linearity (NL) along isotope chains have been proposed as a tool to search for fifth-force mediators. At the same time, these tests can potentially teach us about the structure of heavy nuclei at unprecedented precision, where King NL has already been observed in several systems. A robust interpretation of the existing data, however, is hampered by incomplete control over the Standard Model (SM) contributions. We develop a systematic effective field theory framework, matching the SM onto scalar non-relativistic QED in the infinite nuclear mass limit and then onto quantum-mechanical potentials. This approach organizes all nuclear effects into a small set of Wilson coefficients and cleanly separates short- and long-distance physics. We show that the commonly used treatment of the $\langle r^2\rangle^2$ term needs to be reconsidered, as it arises only at second-order in perturbation theory, and we derive the long-range $1/r^4$ potential from nuclear polarizability. Applying the framework to hydrogen-like systems, we provide a transparent classification of SM sources of King NL relevant for current and future isotope-shift experiments. The formalism can be applied to learn about the shape of the heavy scalar nuclei at a higher level of precision and detail than what was previously attainable.</description>

      <title>Real-time evolution of critical modes in the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model for the critical mode of the critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram is developed, which allows us to investigate the critical slowing down effect quantitatively in the QCD phase diagram, especially in the proximity of the CEP, without any phenomenological parameters. The relaxation time from nonequilibrium to equilibrium in the QCD phase diagram is extracted from the Langevin simulations of the QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model. It is found that in a narrow region along the phase boundary radiated from the CEP, the relaxation time is enhanced significantly. Outside this narrow region, the relaxation time drops drastically, which implies that the dynamic critical region is small in the QCD phase diagram. We also find that the effects of critical slowing down are mild on the chemical freeze-out curves.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing and Axial Charges in the Parity-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard parity doublet model with its mass-mixing mechanism fails to describe the axial charge $g_A$ of the nucleon. While $g_A = 1$ in the original Gell-Mann--Levy model, which reproduces the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of QCD, in the presence of a chirally invariant baryon mass the mass mixing leads to $g_A &lt; 1 $ whereas phenomenologically it is about 1.28. We propose to remedy this problem by introducing kinetic-mixing terms corresponding to meson-baryon derivative couplings, similar in spirit to the two-mixing-angle scenario of the $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing. This extended parity doublet model contains five parameters in the effective baryonic Lagrangian. Three of them can be determined by using the empirical results for the axial charge of the nucleon together with the masses of the nucleon and its parity partner, the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We discuss various options how to determine the remaining parameters, touching upon the mass of both parity partners if the chiral condensate is put to zero; the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit; and the values of meson-baryon coupling constants related to the decays of the resonance to pion-nucleon and sigma-nucleon.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin polarization on transport and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin polarization provides a novel probe of the rotational properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We investigate the effective transport and thermodynamic coefficients in non-central O+O collisions, employing a parton distribution function that incorporates spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity. Within a kinetic theory framework, we find that the magnitude of the squared speed of sound ($c_s^2$) is only weakly modified by spin polarization, whereas the specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$), specific bulk viscosity ($\zeta/s$), and mean free path ($\lambda$) show substantial changes.
  When spin polarization is included, both $c_s^2$ and $\zeta/s$ develop a nonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, with an inflection point near $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ GeV, corresponding to an average parton chemical potential of $\langle\mu_p\rangle=0.021$ GeV. These results suggest that spin polarization may serve as a useful probe for constraining the effective equation of state of QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Understanding the correlation between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative correlation between the magnitudes of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) has been accurately measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC collider. As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\approx 40\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Conservation, crossing symmetry, and completeness in diagrammatic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diagrammatic analysis of interacting particle assemblies harbors a fundamental mismatch between two of its main implementations: Phi-derivable (conserving) approximations and parquet (crossing symmetric) models. No termwise expansion, short of the exact theory itself, can be both conserving and crossing symmetric. This work applies the Kraichnan embedded-Hamiltonian formalism for strongly coupled systems to investigate consistency of the interplay between purely pair-mediated correlations and pair-irreducible ones. The approach sheds a different light on the issue of crossing symmetry versus conservation. In the process, the parquet equations acquire a different formulation.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>
