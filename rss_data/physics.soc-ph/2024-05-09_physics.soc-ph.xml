      <title>Comparative analysis of graph randomization: Tools,methods, pitfalls, and best practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph randomization techniques play a crucial role in network analysis, allowing researchers to assess the statistical significance of observed network properties and distinguish meaningful patterns from random fluctuations. In this survey we provide an overview of the graph randomization methods available in the most popular software tools for network analysis. We propose a comparative analysis of popular software tools to highlight their functionalities and limitations. Through case studies involving diverse graph types, we demonstrate how different randomization methods can lead to divergent conclusions, emphasizing the importance of careful method selection based on the characteristics of the observed network and the research question at hand. This survey proposes some guidelines for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and utilize graph randomization techniques effectively in their network analysis projects.</description>

      <title>The Other Side of the Coin: Recipient Norms and Their Impact on Indirect Reciprocity and Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cooperation depends on indirect reciprocity. In this work, we explore the concept of indirect reciprocity using a donation game in an infinitely large population. In particular, we examine how updating the reputations of recipients influences cooperation. Our work adds a time-scale parameter for updating donor and recipient reputations. We find a trade-off between the level of cooperation and evolutionary stability influenced by social norms. `Forgiving' recipient norms enhance cooperation but increase susceptibility to defectors, whereas `unforgiving' norms reduce cooperation but defend against invasion by defectors. Expanding to include gossip groups allows us to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of the time-scale parameter, identifying `generous' norms that support cooperation, and `strict' norms that discourage such generosity, ultimately showing vulnerability to defector invasions and potential cooperation collapse.</description>

      <title>Design of Targeted Community-Based Resource Allocation in the Presence of Vaccine Hesitancy via a Data-Driven Compartmental Stochastic Optimization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccines have proven effective in mitigating the threat of severe infections and deaths during outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, vaccine hesitancy (VH) complicates disease spread prediction and healthcare resource assessment across regions and populations. We propose a modeling framework that integrates an epidemiological compartmental model that captures the spread of an infectious disease within a multi-stage stochastic program (MSP) that determines the allocation of critical resources under uncertainty. The proposed compartmental MSP model adaptively manages the allocation of resources to account for changes in population behavior toward vaccines (i.e., variability in VH), the unique patterns of disease spread, and the availability of healthcare resources over time and space. The compartmental MSP model allowed us to analyze the price of fairness in resource allocation. Using real COVID-19 vaccination and healthcare resource data from Arkansas, U.S. (January-May 2021), our findings include: (i) delaying the initial deployment of additional ventilators by one month could lead to an average increase in the expected number of deaths by 285.41/month, highlighting the importance of prompt action; (ii) each additional ventilator in the initial stockpile and in supply leads to a decrease in the expected number of deaths by 1.09/month and 0.962/month, respectively, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a large stockpile and scalable production response; (iii) the cost of ensuring equitable resource allocation varies over time and location, peaking during the peak of a disease outbreak and in densely populated areas. This study emphasizes the importance of flexible, informed public health decision-making and preparedness, providing a model for effective resource allocation in public health emergencies.</description>

      <title>Network science meets history. Local balance in global international relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alliances and conflicts represent important features of complex systems like international relations. Such relations create a time-evolving signed network, where each node contributes in a unique manner to the global balance of the system. Therefore, a local index mathematically quantifying such a property becomes valuable. In this work, we introduce a local balance index for signed networks. We analyze its mathematical foundations and unique structural properties, differentiating it from existing local vertex invariants. We also establish a novel methodology linking changes in a nation's local balance to historical events. By scrutinizing the time series of local balance for countries between 1816 and 2014, we detect and categorize major historic events based on balance fluctuations. This approach harmonizes quantitative and qualitative analyses, and combined with the theory of "balance of power" is able to build up a new mixed approach to history based on network theory.</description>

      <title>Critical mobility in policy making for epidemic containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When considering airborne epidemic spreading in social systems, a natural connection arises between mobility and epidemic contacts. As individuals travel, possibilities to encounter new people either at the final destination or during the transportation process appear. Such contacts can lead to new contagion events. In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves. We consider how the different interventions impact societal well-being, the economy and the population. Finally, we propose a mitigation framework based on the critical nature of mobility in an epidemic, able to suppress incidence and oscillations at will, preventing extreme incidence peaks with potential to saturate health care resources.</description>

      <title>Designing a sector-coupled European energy system robust to 60 years of historical weather data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification, they encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand. However, most infrastructure planning is based on a single weather year, resulting in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize energy infrastructure for a European energy system designed for net-zero CO$_2$ emissions in 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the capacity layouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate resource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual weather variability causes variation of $\pm$10\% in total system cost. The most expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not the highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years including compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective design. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective robustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the average CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\% of 1990 levels. Our findings highlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures, making them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of historical weather data.</description>

      <title>Network science Ising states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical, combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the $2$D Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the $2$D Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning using echo-state network and its application to pedestrian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <title>Recurrence analysis of meteorological data from climate zones in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study on the spatio-temporal pattern underlying the climate dynamics in various locations spread over India, including the Himalayan region, coastal region, central and northeastern parts of India. We try to capture the variations in the complexity of their dynamics derived from temperature and relative humidity data from 1948-2022. By estimating the recurrence-based measures from the reconstructed phase space dynamics using a sliding window analysis on the data sets, we study the climate variability in different spatial locations. The study brings out the variations in the complexity of the underlying dynamics as well as their heterogeneity across the locations in India. We find almost all locations indicate shifts to more irregular and stochastic dynamics for temperature data around 1972-79 and shifts back to more regular dynamics beyond 2000. These patterns correlate with reported shifts in the climate and Indian Summer Monsoon related to strong and moderate ENSO events and confirm their associated regional variability.</description>
