      <title>The Dissipative Effect of Caputo--Time-Fractional Derivatives and its Implications for the Solutions of Nonlinear Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In honor of the great Russian mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov, we would like to draw attention in the present paper to a curious mathematical observation concerning fractional differential equations describing physical systems, whose time evolution for integer derivatives has a time-honored conservative form. This observation, although known to the general mathematical community, has not, in our view, been satisfactorily addressed. More specifically, we follow the recent exploration of Caputo-Riesz time-space-fractional nonlinear wave equation, in which two of the present authors introduced an energy-type functional and proposed a finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the continuous model. The relevant Klein-Gordon equation considered here has the form: \begin{equation} \frac {\partial ^\beta \phi (x , t)} {\partial t ^\beta} - \Delta ^\alpha \phi (x , t) + F ^\prime (\phi (x , t)) = 0, \quad \forall (x , t) \in (-\infty,\infty) \end{equation} where we explore the sine-Gordon nonlinearity $F(\phi)=1-\cos(\phi)$ with smooth initial data. For $\alpha=\beta=2$, we naturally retrieve the exact, analytical form of breather waves expected from the literature. Focusing on the Caputo temporal derivative variation within $1&lt; \beta &lt; 2$ values for $\alpha=2$, however, we observe artificial dissipative effects, which lead to complete breather disappearance, over a time scale depending on the value of $\beta$. We compare such findings to single degree-of-freedom linear and nonlinear oscillators in the presence of Caputo temporal derivatives and also consider anti-damping mechanisms to counter the relevant effect. These findings also motivate some interesting directions for further study, e.g., regarding the consideration of topological solitary waves, such as kinks/antikinks and their dynamical evolution in this model.</description>

      <title>Existence of solitary waves in particle lattices with power-law forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of small solitary waves for one-dimensional lattices of particles that each repel every other particle with a force that decays as a power of distance. For force exponents $\alpha+1$ with $\frac43&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, we employ fixed-point arguments to find near-sonic solitary waves having scaled velocity profiles close to non-degenerate solitary-wave profiles of fractional KdV or generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. These equations were recently found to approximately govern unidirectional long-wave motions in these lattices.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of matrix coupled Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks: excitable behavior and global decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is observed in many natural systems, with examples ranging from neuronal activation to walking pedestrians. The models proposed by Winfree and Kuramoto stand as the classic frameworks for investigating these phenomena. The Kuramoto model, in particular, has been extended in different ways since its original formulation to account for more general scenarios. One such extension replaces the coupling parameter with a coupling matrix, describing a form of generalized frustration with broken rotational symmetry. A key feature of this model is the existence of {\it phase tuned states}, characterized by having the phase of the order parameter pointing in the direction of the dominant eigenvector of the coupling matrix. Here we investigate the matrix coupled Kuramoto model on networks with two modules, such that one module is in the phase tuned state and the other in a state where the order parameter rotates. We identified different regimes in which one or the other module dominates the dynamics. We found, in particular, that the phase tuned module can create a bottleneck for the oscillation of the rotating module, leading to a behavior similar to the charge and fire regimes of excitable systems. We also found an extended region in the parameter space where motion is globally disordered, even though one of the modules presented high levels of synchronization when uncoupled.</description>
