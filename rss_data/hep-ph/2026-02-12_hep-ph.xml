      <title>Pushing the Limits of Atomic Dark Matter: First-Principles Recombination Rates and Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal atomic dark matter with its distinctive cooling mechanisms offers an instructive framework for understanding the potential impact of dark matter on small-scale structure formation and early cosmology. The model consists of two fermions with opposite charges under a hidden Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)_{D}$ and masses $m_{p_{D}}$ and $m_{e_{D}}$, respectively. Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $\alpha_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m_{e_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m_{p_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $\alpha_{D}\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings. Combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck and ACT with BAO and Pantheon+ data, we place new constraints on the atomic dark matter parameter space, identifying regions where acoustic damping and recombination dynamics leave observable imprints on the CMB.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Top Quark FCNC Interactions in SMEFT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, model-independent analysis of rare flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions of the top quark within an effective field theory framework. Beginning with a general parametrisation of top-FCNC couplings, we match these interactions onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operator basis at the top-quark scale. We then perform a global study that incorporates constraints from low-energy flavour observables, electroweak precision data, Higgs and gauge-boson measurements, and electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. By treating the dipole operators as complex, we derive stringent limits on both the real and imaginary components of left- and right-handed FCNC couplings. In particular, we show that constraints from the neutron EDM impose especially strong bounds on products of FCNC couplings involving the transition $t \to u$. Translating these results into the SMEFT framework, we obtain robust constraints on several products of the corresponding SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Finally, we provide predictions for branching ratios and CP asymmetries in rare top-quark FCNC decays. We identify well-motivated benchmark scenarios for future collider searches and emphasise the crucial role of CP-violating effects in probing the flavour structure of the top quark.</description>

      <title>Gravitational scalar production with a generic reheating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational production of decoupled scalars during inflationary and post-inflationary phases is efficient and can lead to over-production. We study this production with various reheating scenarios such as a generic power-law inflaton potential $V_{\rm inf}\propto \phi^k$ as well as a multi-stage reheating scenario. We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $\lambda_s$, the mass $m_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k &lt; 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k &gt; 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar. In multi-stage reheating, we show that the enhancement/dilution effect of subsequent reheating phases factorises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the three-loop unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements, with single- and two-mass corrections, and the associated deep-inelastic massive Wilson coefficients in the region $Q^2 \gg m_Q^2$, the calculation of which has been completed recently. We also provide fast and precise numerical representations of the massless Wilson coefficients, splitting functions to tree-loop order, and target-mass corrections in $x$-space well suited for QCD-fitting codes.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Bell nonlocality and entanglement in polarized electron-positron annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in electron-positron annihilation as a massive two-qubit quantum system can be used to study the quantum correlations at high energies. This paper is theoretically dedicated to how polarization of lepton beams manipulate the Bell nonlocality and entanglement of hyperon pairs system. The response of CHSH parameter, concurrence, and negativity to the polarization degree is numerically calculated by exploiting the joint spin density matrix of $Y\bar{Y}$ system. Different influences of longitudinal and transverse polarization of beams on entanglement are found and compared. The results provide alternative perspectives for the decay of charmoniun to hyperon pairs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement redistribution of hyperon-antihyperon pair via sequential decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high energy electron-positron annihilation constitute a naturally spin-entangled system in the high energy regime. Recently, a probabilistic amplification of entanglement, termed autodistillation, has been found in the daughter baryon-antibaryon pairs from hyperon decay and is constrained by an upper boundary. This work demonstrates that the quantum entanglement in this process may be accompanied by a decrease, constrained by a lower boundary, but will not be completely lost. Thus, the entanglement of these systems undergoes redistribution within the phase space during the sequential decays of hyperons, and an important role of hyperon polarization is highlighted. By using the explicit spin density matrix of baryon pairs, it is also found that quantumness of the system characterized by quantum discord always have the possibility to increase during decay processes, even when entanglement evaluated by concurrence and negativity does not increase.</description>

      <title>Unidentified falling objects in the LHC as dark matter signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($\Omega_\mathrm{DM}\sim\Omega_\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs.</description>

      <title>Structural dissection of hadronic molecules: The $D^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ family under QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static electromagnetic properties of three charm--strange molecular tetraquark candidates with quantum numbers $J^{P}=1^{+}$, namely the $D\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $D^{\ast}\bar{K}$, and $D^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}$ systems. The analysis is carried out within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules, using interpolating currents constructed from colour-singlet meson bilinears to reflect their molecular configurations. Both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions are included,and numerical predictions for the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments are obtained. The magnetic moments are found to lie in the range $1$--$3$ nuclear magnetons, with the largest value associated with the $D^{*}\bar{K}$ configuration. The quadrupole moments are an order of magnitude smaller, of order $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{fm}^{2}$, indicating only weak deviations from spherical charge distributions. A flavour decomposition shows that the magnetic response is dominated by the light quarks, while the charm-quark contribution is strongly suppressed, a feature naturally expected for loosely bound hadronic molecules. The present analysis extends QCD light-cone sum-rule studies of exotic hadrons by providing a systematic determination of the electromagnetic moments of the $D^{(\ast)}\bar K^{(\ast)}$ molecular systems. These results provide quantitative benchmarks that may help discriminate between molecular configurations and more compact multiquark interpretations and may offer useful guidance for future experimental studies of electromagnetic signatures of charm--strange exotic states.</description>

      <title>A fast Bayesian surrogate for the photon flux in ultra-peripheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast surrogate for the Equivalent Photon Approximation (EPA) flux in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), based on a Bayesian neural network (BNN) trained over analytical flux integrals with an iterative procedure focused on regions of high relative uncertainties to minimise the number of integrations. The surrogate propagates experimentally available uncertainties on the neutron skin thickness and surface diffuseness. Once trained, this surrogate technique brings an estimated gain of two orders of magnitude in CPU time. The implementation provides a modular framework for rapidly propagating updated nuclear priors and assessing uncertainties for photon flux in future UPC analyses.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($\pi$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($\eta_c$, $\eta_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional landscape of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a recently proposed form-invariant algebraic model for the quark propagator and the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of pseudoscalar mesons to study the internal structure of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons. This model facilitates the construction of the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction, whose projection onto an appropriate flavor-basis leads to the light-front wavefunction for convenient linear combinations of the $s \bar{s}$ and $l\bar{l}\sim(u \bar{u} + d \bar{d})$ states. Using an overlap representation, we compute the valence-quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs). The construction of the model ensures that this multidimensional quantity is determined entirely by the corresponding valence-quark distribution amplitudes. Once the GPDs are constructed, we carry out a straightforward derivation of other desired physical observables such as the distribution functions and the electromagnetic form factors. We also provide explicit comparisons with available results, demonstrating that the present model offers a consistent physical picture for all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytic expressions of the three-loop virtual corrections to the helicity amplitudes of 2 -&gt; 2 four-fermion scattering processes in massless QED. The contributing Feynman diagrams are grouped into integrand families characterised by independent Symanzik polynomials and decomposed in terms of master integrals using an optimised integration-by-parts strategy. Upon the renormalisation of the ultraviolet divergences and the extraction of the universal infrared pole structure, the finite results are expressed in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six. Amplitudes for dimuon production in electron-positron annihilations, electron-muon scattering, and Bhabha scattering are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>The formation of inhomogeneities in gravitational string like mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of the inhomogeneities in modern inflationary Universe scenarios is related, in particular, with the study of the role played by scalar fields in cosmological evolution. We present the model described by one of the extensions of the Abelian-Higgs theory, where the scale-invariant approach to the Standard Model (SM) is achieved by introducing the complex scalar fields and the vector fields in the hidden (dark) sector, where the latter and the SM are minimally coupled to gravity. The formation of the cosmological compact objects intuitively is explained in terms of the topological line defects - the string like tubes. The strings can get an energetically preferable configuration corresponding to the magnetic flux quantum inside an area defined by the mass of dark vector field.</description>

      <title>Weak Annihilation Contribution to Angular Observables in $B_{c}^+\to D^{\ast+}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the rare semileptonic decays $B_{c}^+ \to D^{\ast+}(\to P_1 P_2)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, with $P_1 P_2 = D^+ \pi^0$ or $D^0 \pi^+$, and $\ell=\mu, \tau$. We focus on the impact of weak annihilation contributions alongside penguin, box, and long-distance effects. Using the effective Hamiltonian for $b \to d \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions and $B_c \to D^{*}$ form factors from covariant confined quark model inputs, we compute the differential branching ratios, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal helicity fraction of the $D^{\ast}$, and various normalized angular coefficients. The results of the observables show that weak annihilation effects are sizable, particularly at low $q^2$, significantly modifying several observables and shifting zero-crossings. Resonance effects dominate at high $q^2$, restricting reliable analysis windows. We conclude that the inclusion of weak annihilation is essential for precise Standard Model predictions and for isolating possible New Physics effects in $B_c^+ \to D^{*+} \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the three-loop QCD+QED mixed corrections to the on-shell heavy-quark mass and wave-function renormalization constants through orders $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^m\alpha^n)$ with $m+n=3$. From these results, we derive the three-loop relation between the pole mass and the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ mass, including the complete mixed QCD+QED contributions. The corresponding quark-mass anomalous dimension in the presence of both interactions is also extracted. Furthermore, we provide explicit conversion formulae up to the same perturbative order between the pole mass and the trace-anomaly subtracted $\sigma$-mass of heavy quark.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter in conformal Majoron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) in a classically conformal U(1)' extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos and a Majoron-like singlet scalar that generate the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Working in the regime of strongly suppressed active-sterile mixing, we show that the observed DM abundance can be produced through freeze-in from feeble interactions mediated by the heavy Z' and the conformal scalar. We solve the Boltzmann equation for the nonthermal phase-space distribution and confront the scenario with Lyman-$\alpha$ data by computing the matter power spectrum. For keV-scale sterile neutrinos we identify the viable parameter space consistent with structure-formation and X-ray bounds, including regions compatible with a tentative 3.5 keV line. If a second sterile state is long-lived, late decays can realize a two-component setup that alleviates the $S_8$ tension. In a highly fine-tuned variant of the model, the 220 PeV KM3NeT event can also be explained by invoking the decay of a superheavy sterile neutrino.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early universe grants access to energy scales far beyond those achievable in terrestrial experiments and allows unstable Standard Model particles to play an active dynamical role. In this contribution, we focus on recent studies aimed at quantifying the potential of the early universe to probe the properties and interactions of axions. The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>A Small Patch Hypothesis in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If our observable Universe is only a tiny region of a vastly larger and conformally older spacetime, then the usual formulations of the classical flatness and horizon problems of the Hot Big Bang can be reinterpreted as artifacts manifesting an observational selection effect; we occupy a small causal domain of a much larger causally-connected and possibly non-flat spacetime. A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\sim$$\Lambda^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $\Lambda$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\ll \Lambda^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

      <title>Imaging two-body correlations in atomic nuclei via low- and high-energy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the correlated behavior of nucleons inside atomic nuclei constitutes a long-standing challenge, both experimentally and theoretically. It has recently been understood that two-particle correlations in the azimuthal distribution of final hadrons emitted in ultra-relativistic ultra-central ion-ion collisions can be used to quantify ground-state two-body correlations. Performing systematic ab initio nuclear structure calculations of light nuclei, we demonstrate that such an observable does provide a meaningful imaging of nuclear ground states, naturally leading to a robust interpretation of the various categories of two-nucleon correlations at play. This is at variance with the low-energy approach relying on Kumar operators whose traditional interpretation in terms of deformation parameters is shown to be inoperative. A future interesting development will consist of targeting specific three-particle correlations to isolate three-nucleon correlations in which additional nuclear structure information of interest leave their fingerprint.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

Abstract: We show that scalar field fluctuations alone can drive cosmic acceleration, provided the universe is spatially closed and the Compton wavelength of the field exceeds the radius of curvature. This mechanism may open new perspectives on inflation and dark energy, which could arise from a gas of sufficiently light bosons in a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological production of dark matter in the Universe and in the laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.
  The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.
  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Improved linear Boltzmann transport model for hadron and jet suppression in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets serve as powerful tomographic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the expanding landscape of jet observables reveals multi-faceted aspects of jet-medium interactions, a precise and simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and full jets still remains a challenge for theoretical models. In this work, we present two essential improvements to the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to bridge this gap. First, instead of implementing in-medium parton transport after vacuum parton showers complete, we introduce a medium scale at which the parton transport is inserted into the vacuum parton showers, providing a more physical picture of parton-QGP interactions. Second, we incorporate color flow information into the LBT model, enabling string connections between partons whose configurations are correlated with the medium-modified parton showers before hadronization. We demonstrate that both improvements alter the predicted ratio of hadron to jet quenching, leading to a satisfactory description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and jets with different flavors within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Classical strings and the double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy is by now a well-established relationship between scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in gauge and gravity (field) theories, and is itself inspired by amplitude relations in string theory. In this paper, we generalise the classical double copy to the motion of strings, taking as a case study the motion of an open string in a background abelian gauge field. We argue that the double copy of this situation is a closed string moving in a spacetime background arising as the double copy of the gauge theory background. The gauge theory background we consider is that of a constant electric field, which has a critical value beyond which the open string motion is pathological. We find no counterpart of this behaviour in the double copy, and interpret this result. We then examine how the closed string nevertheless still knows about the single copy gauge theory. Our results pave the way for more systematic study of the double copy in a classical string context, thus going beyond the KLT relations for amplitudes in flat space.</description>

Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the short-range nucleon-nucleon interaction is essential for the interpretation of correlation femtoscopy measurements in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions. We present an analytical treatment of the strong interaction in two-nucleon systems by modelling it with a square-well potential and solving the Schroedinger equation in the presence of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting pair wave function is regular at small relative distances and allows for the inclusion of multiple partial waves. We apply this framework to proton-proton femtoscopy and compute theoretical correlation functions for realistic source sizes. We demonstrate that the commonly used Lednicky-Lyuboshits asymptotic approximation overestimates the correlation signal for small sources. Comparisons with numerical calculations using the CATS framework and the Argonne v18 potential show good agreement within current experimental uncertainties. The proposed analytical approach provides a practical and flexible tool for femtoscopic analyses of nucleon and baryon pairs.</description>

      <title>Beyond thermal approximations: Precise cosmological bounds on Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive updated cosmological bounds on light axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to leptons or photons, using a full phase-space treatment of their production from the primordial thermal plasma. The ALP phase-space distribution, obtained by solving the momentum-dependent Boltzmann equation for the relevant production processes, is consistently propagated into the computation of cosmological observables, allowing us to assess the impact of non-thermal spectral distortions on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Using state-of-the-art measurements of the cosmic microwave background from Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, complemented with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis determinations of primordial deuterium and helium abundances, we obtain the following 95\% credible limits on the ALP decay constant: $f_a &gt; 1.63 \times 10^6 \, {\rm GeV}$, $9.41 \times 10^6 \, {\rm GeV}$ and $8.06 \times 10^4 \, {\rm GeV}$ for ALPs coupled to electrons, muons and taus, respectively. For the ALP-photon coupling we find $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 1.98 \times 10^{-8} \, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Including baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument mildly relaxes the constraints, in line with previous analyses of extra relativistic degrees of freedom. Finally, we present forecasts for the LiteBIRD$+$Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD$+$CMB-HD configurations, discussing the importance of an exact phase-space treatment for robust cosmological bounds on ALP interactions.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on vector dark matter-nucleus scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general spin-one dark matter-nucleus interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the nonrelativistic (NR) and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the DM interactions with nucleons and quarks. In the NREFT framework, we present a complete list of NR operators for spin-one DM coupling to nucleons and compute their contributions to the DM response functions. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators between DM and light quarks and the photon, and perform NR reductions to match them onto the NREFT. We then derive the nuclear scattering rate from these interactions, and employ recent DM direct detection data (from both the nuclear recoil and the Migdal effect) to constrain all these EFT operators and DM electromagnetic properties. We find the elastic nuclear recoil data (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, LZ, and DarkSide-50) set stringent bounds on the EFT coefficients for a DM mass above a few GeV while the Migdal effect datasets (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, and DarkSide-50) can probe the DM mass region as small as 20 MeV. Lastly, we construct a UV complete model that can provide a complex spin-one DM candidate, and at the same time generate DM-quark/photon operators discussed in this work.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>evortran: a modern Fortran package for genetic algorithms with applications from LHC data fitting to LISA signal reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran (or Python) programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Color-glass condensate beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit, perturbative calculations in QCD are conveniently done using the dipole picture which factorizes the scattering amplitude into a perturbative part and the nonperturbative scattering off the nuclear target, described using correlators of Wilson lines. These correlators can be computed in the color-glass condensate effective field theory by using a Gaussian model for the color density of the target. In this work, we generalize the Gaussian model to a generic function that is local in the transverse coordinates and the light-cone time, and show how to compute physical Wilson-line correlators in this model. We also consider a simple model for the color density based on stable probability distributions and show that the small-dipole behavior of the dipole amplitude is modified from quadratic to a power law, where the power is given by the stability parameter of the distribution. This generalization of the Gaussian model is suitable for numerical applications in the high-energy limit and can be used in future phenomenological studies of the nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>A New Source of Phase Transition Gravitational Waves: Heavy Particle Braking Across Bubble Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the new heavy dark matter production mechanism from cosmic phase transition, we propose a novel mechanism for the generation of microscopic gravitational waves (GWs) during cosmological first-order phase transitions arising from the braking of heavy particles as they traverse bubble walls. Unlike the well-known sources such as bubble collisions, sound waves, or turbulence in the plasma, this mechanism originates from the direct interaction between massive particles and the expanding bubble wall. We use quantum field theory to rigorously compute the gravitational radiation. The resulting GW spectrum exhibits distinctive features: The peak frequency is tightly correlated with the bubble wall velocity, while the peak amplitude scales as the fourth power of the heavy particle mass. These unique dependencies offer a new observational handle on particle physics beyond the Standard Model. We illustrate this mechanism within a specific model framework and demonstrate its viability. Our findings enrich the landscape of phase transition GW sources and open new avenues for more directly probing heavy particle dynamics and new physics models in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fermion can be chiral or vectorlike with respect to a given symmetry, depending on its coupling to the corresponding gauge boson. Vectorlike fermions have a distinct property that their left-handed and right-handed components behave in the same way under the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we investigate an extension of the standard model with an $SU(2)$ doublet of vectorlike leptons and two complex scalars. The new physics effects on the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, as well as the electron and muon pair production processes at $e^+e^-$ colliders are analyzed. Taking into account the updated measurement results of the electron and muon $g-2$, the LEP and the LHC data, the viable parameter space of the model is identified. We also examine the prospect of testing the model using $\mu^+\mu^-$ signals from electron-position annihilation at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). The analysis shows that the FCC-ee will be able to exclude a significant part of the parameter space, pinpointing exiguous viable regions to be tested in the future due to its high precision.</description>

      <title>Softening holographic nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryons in the holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model are described by instanton solutions on the flavor branes. A commonly used approximation for dense baryonic matter replaces the many-instanton solution by a simpler, spatially homogeneous, ansatz, which requires a discontinuity in the holographic direction of the non-abelian gauge field in order to account for topological baryon number. We point out that the simplest configuration with a single jump - often used in previous studies - results in matter at saturation density that is much stiffer than real-world nuclear matter. This is improved, although not completely remedied, by adding a second jump. We present a systematic discussion of all possible configurations up to four jumps, dynamically computing locations of and behavior at the discontinuities. We find solutions that continuously connect to those based on pointlike baryons, thus, for the first time, establishing a concrete link between the instantonic and homogeneous pictures. This is supported by translating the multi-jump profiles of the gauge field into gauge invariant multi-layer charge distributions. The most important of our novel configurations has a block-like structure in the bulk, becomes pointlike at low density and/or large coupling, and is energetically preferred over all previously studied configurations. Therefore, our work lays the ground for improved predictions from holography for dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We present a calculation of the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}(x, Q^2)$ in momentum-space approach using the Block-Durand-Ha (BDH) parameterization of the proton structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$. The results are compared with H1 data and extended to high inelasticity. We also examine the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}(\frac{Q^2}{s}, Q^2)$ obtained at a fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$, comparing them with both the HERA data and the color dipole model bounds. These results and comparisons with HERA data demonstrate that the suggested method for the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}$ can be applied in analyses of the Large Hadron Collider and Future Circular Collider projects. The effect of adding a simple higher twist term of the form $F_{2}{\ast}H_{2}/Q^2$ to the description of the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{r}}{F_{2}}(\frac{Q^2}{s}, Q^2)$ at low-$x$ and low-$Q^2$ values for comparison with the color dipole bounds and the HERA data is investigated.</description>

Abstract: We explore the observational consequences of resonant particle production during inflation, focusing on its impact on dark matter annihilation signals today. A transient burst of particle production generates localised features in the primordial power spectrum, enhancing the formation of compact small-scale dark matter structures known as prompt cusps. If dark matter consists of thermal WIMPs, the resulting small-scale structures substantially boost annihilation rates, leaving potentially detectable imprints in gamma-ray observations. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data targeting the Virgo cluster, we derive upper limits on the thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$, connecting inflationary particle production in the early universe with present-day observations constraining dark matter annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) from the DIS structure functions has emerged as a novel tool for probing observable quantities. The method proposed by Kharzeev-Levin to determine entanglement entropy in DIS from parton distribution functions (PDFs) improves on the momentum-space approach proposed by Lappi et al.[Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf84}, 84 (2024)] and further developed by Boroun and Ha [Phys. Rev. D {\bf109}, 094037 (2024)] using Laplace transform techniques. The entropy of charged hadrons is obtained from the parameterization of the proton structure function and compared with H1 data, HSS, and HERA PDFs. Our results for the entanglement entropy align very well with the H1 data across a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$. Finally, the behavior of the entanglement entropy is described at fixed $\sqrt{s}$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$, which indicates that the polarization of the exchanged photon for entropy determination is transverse
  at this specific kinematic point. The effect of adding a simple higher twist term to the description of entropy at low-$x$ and low-$Q^2$ values for comparison with HERA data is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of composite dark matter that disassembles into a cascade while crossing the Earth. This occurs for loosely bound composite dark matter, where the binding energy per constituent is small, such that scattering with Standard Model nuclei typically imparts enough energy to dissociate a constituent from its composite. Trajectories and cascade profiles are found for dissociated constituents that are further diverted by scattering through the Earth. Such scattering cascades are a common feature of TeV-scale weakly-interacting dark matter loosely bound in composites. We identify underground detector signatures of constituent cascades that depend on composite characteristics; these signatures include non-collinear multiple scatters in detectors, parameter-dependent timing separation of multiscatter events, and regions of parameter space where a dark matter cascade would leave a coincident signature in different underground laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the masses of light excited $q\bar{q}$ mesons using QCD sum rules at next-to-leading order (NLO). To probe excited states, we construct several interpolating currents involving covariant derivatives. The calculation is carried out up to dimension-8 condensates, including NLO perturbative and $m\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ corrections. Employing Gaussian sum rules, we obtain several $J^P=2^\pm$ nonets with masses that agree well with experiments. Several $J=0,1$ states compatible with experiments are also obtained using both Gaussian and Laplace sum rules. In particular, the $J^P=2^+$ current couples to two distinct $J^P=2^+$ resonances. This work demonstrates the efficacy of operators with covariant derivatives for studying excited hadrons.</description>

      <title>Observational Probes of the Neutron Star Equation of State with Hyperons, Bosonic Dark Matter, and Quark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The presence of dark matter in neutron stars is of growing interest due to its potential impact on the structure and observable properties of these objects. Among the various candidates, the hypothetical sexaquark has emerged as a promising bosonic dark matter particle, potentially forming under extreme conditions in neutron star cores.
  Aims. We investigate whether a hybrid neutron star model that includes hyperons, bosonic dark matter (in the form of sexaquarks), and deconfined quark matter can satisfy all current observational constraints. We particularly focus on identifying the range of sexaquark masses consistent with mass-radius measurements and the tidal deformability limit.
  Methods. We used the DD2Y-T model for the hadronic phase, which includes hyperons, and a nonlocal Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the deconfined quark phase. The phase transition was modeled as a smooth crossover using the replacement interpolation construction method. Sexaquark-baryon interactions were introduced via an effective mass shift representing repulsion. We incorporated the full set of current observational data, including NICER measurements of PSRs J0437-4715 and newly published J0614-3329 data, and performed a Bayesian analysis to constrain the sexaquark mass.
  Results. Our results show that the presence of the sexaquark softens the equation of state, enabling the hybrid model to satisfy both the radius and tidal deformability constraints around the canonical 1.4 M_\odot neutron stars. We find that hybrid EOSs with a sexaquark mass around 1900 MeV are in agreement with all available constraints, including those from HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, which represent the lowest and highest mass neutron stars observed to date. The Bayesian analysis favors a sexaquark mass range of 1885-1935 MeV, supporting the potential relevance of this exotic particle in neutron star interiors.</description>

      <title>A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory is a paradigmatic model that exhibits gauge-field-mediated-confinement of pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to two separate mechanisms to form stable ``hadron'' bound states of two mesons: either induced by an effective attractive interaction, or a new dynamical binding mechanism induced by an effective repulsion. The repulsively bound hadron is a high-energy state stabilized by being energetically separated from the two-meson continuum through quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the parity-odd part of the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions in a background gravitational field. We start from a manifestly real form of the Lagrangian (that is, not only real up to a total derivative), and we regularize it by means of Pauli-Villars fermions. All parity-odd terms in the anomaly cancel in the integrand, so that the result of the anomaly is necessarily parity-even.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we propose a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by considering the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density within the framework of teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the inherent difficulties in the old models. Furthermore, the Nieh-Yan coupling causes parity violation in gravitational waves, and this can be considered as a clear prediction of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>
