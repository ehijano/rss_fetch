      <title>Real-space orbital tiling approach for the design of novel superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial advances in the field, we still lack a predictive framework capable of guiding the discovery of new families of superconductors. While momentum-space approaches have advanced the microscopic understanding of superconductivity, they offer limited guidance for materials design based on atomic building blocks. Here, we propose a real-space framework which conceptualizes Cooper pairs as confined standing waves resulting from coherent tilings of atomic orbitals. We call this model the Real-space Orbital Superconducting Pathway (ROSP). Using a tight-binding toy model, we show that the energetics of electron pairing depend on the configuration and overlap of real-space orbitals, which motivates \textit{a priori} design of superconducting families from orbital tiling. We connect the ROSP model to Roald Hoffmann's isolobal analogy to classify families of superconductors based on shared orbital tilings, rather than structure or electron count. As an example, we suggest that superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and LaNiO$_{2}$, despite differing structures and electron counts, may arise from a common ROSP. We introduce a new notation to classify two-dimensional square-net ROSPs and further propose several new families of superconductors on the anti-cuprate lattice. This framework provides a new model for predicting and designing families of high-T$_c$ superconductors from real-space orbital architecture, even without microscopic knowledge of the attractive pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for two-gap superconductivity in hydrogen-intercalated titanium diselenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer an extremely rich material platform in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. The unconventional aspects include exotic coupling mechanisms such as the Ising pairing, a complex interplay with other electronic orders such as charge-density waves (CDWs), symmetry-breaking and topological effects, and non-trivial gap structures such as multi-gap and possible nodal phases. Among TMDs, titanium diselenide (1$T$-TiSe$_2$) is one of the most studied and debated cases. Hints to an anomalous structure of its superconducting order parameter have emerged over the years, possibly linked to its spatial texturing in real and reciprocal space due to the presence of a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phase, or to a pressure-driven multi-band Fermi surface. However, a direct evidence for a non-trivial structure of the superconducting gap in this material is still lacking. In this work, we bring the first evidence for a two-gap structure in the recently-discovered H-intercalated TiSe$_2$ superconductor (with T$_c \simeq 3.6$ K) by an extensive experimental study that combines magnetotransport measurements, point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnel spectroscopy. We show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (for $\vec B \parallel c$) as well as the shape of the point-contact and tunneling spectra strongly suggest the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, and can indeed all be fitted in a self-consistent way with the same gap amplitudes $\Delta_1 = 0.26 \pm 0.12$ meV and $\Delta_2 =0.62 \pm 0.18$ meV.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by mirror symmetries provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quasiparticle Generation by Microwave Drives in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave drives are commonly employed to control superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond kagome: $p$-bands in kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Chirality-selective proximity effect between chiral $p$-wave superconductors and quantum Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of superconductors and quantum-Hall insulators are promising platforms of topological quantum computation. However, these two systems are incompatible in some aspects such as a strong magnetic field, the Meissner effect, and chirality. In this work, we address the condition that the superconducting proximity effect works in the bulk of quantum Hall states, and identify an essential role played by the vortex lattice regardless of pairing symmetry. We extend this finding to a heterostructure of a chiral $p$-wave superconductor in the mixed state and an integer quantum Hall insulator. The proximity effect works selectively in the lowest Landau level depending on relative chiralities. If the chiralities align, a topological phase transition to a topological superconductor occurs.</description>

      <title>MPd5 kagome superconductors studied by density functional calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties; exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a type of kagome superconductor, MPd5 (M is a group-IIA metal element), and identify that it exhibits coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial topological properties. We uncover its phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors, predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. These Tc can be effectively tuned through the application of external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have topological properties; e.g., CaPd5 shows topological nontrivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including p-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and s-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Current-Enabled Optical Conductivity of Collective Modes in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>From local spin nematicity to altermagnets: Footprints of band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramer's non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave, and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the topology of linear, quadratic and cubic free fermion band dispersions that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$, and $3$ harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a spin-triplet nematic superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in quantum materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and propose spin-disordered alter-valley magnets in these systems.</description>
