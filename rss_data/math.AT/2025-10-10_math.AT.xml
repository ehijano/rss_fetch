      <title>The homotopy type of the Poincar\'e cobordism category for surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a version of the surface cobordism category $\mathrm{Cob}_2^{\mathrm{SG}}(X)$ over a base space $X$ where surfaces are considered up to self homotopy equivalences instead of diffeomorphisms. We prove the induced functor $B\mathrm{Cob}_2^{\mathrm{SG}}(-): \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ is not $1$-excisive. We show its first derivative $\partial_1 B\mathrm{Cob}_2^{\mathrm{SG}}(-)$ in the Goodwillie sense is equivalent to a Thom spectrum over $B\mathrm{haut}_*^+(S^2)$.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Sequence for Equidimensional Actions of Compact Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we provide a version of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for equidimensional (i.e. smooth with all orbits of the same dimension) actions of compact connected Lie groups on compact manifolds. The main part of this article consists of the proof of the description of the second page of said spectral sequence. This description provides a link between the cohomology of the orbit space (basic cohomology of the foliation by orbits) the Lie algebra cohomology of the appropriate pair $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})$ representing the cohomology of a generic orbit and the de Rham cohomology of the manifold. Due to the somewhat technical nature of the general description we have provided in the penultimate section a thorough study of special cases in which the sequence can be greatly simplified. In particular, vast simplifications can be obtained if the manifold $M$ on which the group acts is assumed to be simply connected or if the acting Lie group has some nice properties. In the final section, we show how to use a blow up process to use our sequence when the action is not equidimensional. We apply this method to give a topological obstruction to the existence Lie group actions on certain manifolds.</description>

      <title>The condensed homotopy type of a scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a condensed version of the \'etale homotopy type of a scheme, which refines both the usual \'etale homotopy type of Friedlander-Artin-Mazur and the pro\'etale fundamental group of Bhatt-Scholze. In the first part of this paper, we prove that this condensed homotopy type satisfies descent along integral morphisms and that the expected fiber sequences hold. We also provide explicit computations, for example, for rings of continuous functions. A key ingredient in many of our arguments is a description of the condensed homotopy type using the Galois category of a scheme introduced by Barwick-Glasman-Haine.
  In the second part, we focus on the fundamental group of the condensed homotopy type in more detail. We show that, unexpectedly, the fundamental group of the condensed homotopy type of the affine line $\mathbf{A}^1_{\mathbf{C}}$ over the complex numbers is nontrivial. Nonetheless, its Noohi completion recovers the pro\'etale fundamental group of Bhatt-Scholze. Moreover, we show that a mild correction, passing to the quasiseparated quotient, fixes most of this group's quirks. Surprisingly, this quotient is often a topological group.</description>

      <title>Concentration structures on categories and horizontal categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory for encoding and manipulating algebraic data on categories via $\textit{concentration structures}$, which are equivalence relations on morphisms that satisfy certain axioms. For any category with a concentration structure we can functorially construct a $\textit{concentration monoid}$, which can be used to give a precise definition of horizontal categorification and decategorification. Moreover, by studying concentration structures on fundamental groupoids, we show that every group arises as the concentration monoid of a trivial category, up to category equivalence.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Positivity for Pontryagin Product in Equivariant K-theory of Loop Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simply-connected simple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $T$ be a maximal torus, $B\supset T$ a Borel subgroup and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup. Then, the product in the (algebraic) based loop group $\Omega(K)$ gives rise to a comultiplication in the topological $T$-equivariant $K$-ring $K_T^{top}(\Omega(K))$. Recall that $\Omega(K)$ is identified with the affine Grassmannian $\mathcal{X}$ (of $G$) and hence we get a comultiplication in $ K_T^{top}(\mathcal{X})$. Dualizing, one gets the Pontryagin product in the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology $K^T_0(\mathcal{X})$, which in-turn gets identified with the convolution product (due to S. Kato). Now, $ K_T^{top}(\mathcal{X})$ has a basis $\{\xi^w\}$ over the representation ring $R(T)$ given by the ideal sheaves corresponding to the finite codimension Schubert varieties $X^w$ in $\mathcal{X}$. We make a positivity conjecture on the comultiplication structure constants in the above basis. Using some results of Kato, this conjecture gives rise to an equivalent conjecture on the positivity of the multiplicative structure constants in $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory $QK_T(G/B)$ in the Schubert basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent pre-print of W\"arn gives a novel pen-and-paper construction of a type family characterizing the path spaces of an arbitrary pushout, and a natural language argument for its correctness. We present the first formalization of the construction and a proof that it is fiberwise equivalent to the path spaces. The formalization is carried out in axiomatic homotopy type theory, using the Agda proof assistant and the agda-unimath library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-th symmetric product of a topological space $X$ is the orbit space of the natural action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the product space $X^n$. In this paper, we compute the sequential topological complexities of (finite products of) the symmetric products of closed orientable surfaces, thereby verifying the rationality conjecture of Farber and Oprea for these spaces. Additionally, we determine the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of (finite products of) the symmetric products of closed non-orientable surfaces. More generally, we provide lower bounds to the LS-category and the sequential topological complexities of the symmetric products of finite CW complexes $X$ in terms of the cohomology of $X$ and its products. On the way, we also obtain new lower bounds to the sequential distributional complexities of continuous maps and study the homotopy groups of the symmetric products of closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Box Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new framework that unifies the filtration and mapper approaches from TDA, and present efficient algorithms to compute it. Termed the box filtration of a PCD, we grow boxes (hyperrectangles) that are not necessarily centered at each point (in place of balls centered at points). We grow the boxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the distribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point cover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that works with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either setting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence diagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers satisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using boxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher order intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same.
  Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that optimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of including more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in $O(m|U(0)|\log(mn\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments considered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover ($\leq$ number of points), $\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box dimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and $q = n \times |X|$. We demonstrate through multiple examples that the box filtration can produce more accurate results to summarize the topology of the PCD than VR and distance-to-measure (DTM) filtrations. Software for our implementation is available at https://github.com/pragup/Box-Filteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kreck's modified surgery gives an approach to classifying smooth $2n$-manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism, i.e. up to connected sum with copies of $S^n \times S^n$. In dimension 4, we use a combination of modified and classical surgery to study various stable equivalence relations which we compare to stable diffeomorphism. Most importantly, we consider homotopy equivalence up to stabilisation with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$.
  As an application, we show that closed oriented homotopy equivalent 4-manifolds with abelian fundamental group are stably diffeomorphic. We give analogues of the cancellation theorems of Hambleton--Kreck for stable homeomorphism for homotopy up to stabilisations. Finally, we give a complete algebraic obstruction to the existence of closed smooth 4-manifolds which are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent up to connected sum with $S^2 \times S^2$.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Adversarial Influence: Characterizing LLM Latent Spaces with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short by focusing on linear directions or isolated features, overlooking the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and relational geometry within model representations. This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically affect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly understood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics within LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six state-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect prompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent topological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model sizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent space becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact, small-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones. This topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly discriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial effects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and neuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals fundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary perspective to existing interpretability methods.</description>

      <title>A Seifert-van Kampen Theorem and the Frobenius Action on Tame Fundamental Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X = P^1_{\mathbb{F}_p}-B$, where $B$ is a divisor with $n$ distinct geometric points, and view $X$ as a $\mathbb{F}_q$-variety with $q = p^r$ for some $r$, we then obtain a short exact sequence of tame fundamental groups:
  \[1\to \pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})\to \pi_1^t(X_{\mathbb{F}_q})\to \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)\to 1.\]
  This gives rise to an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ once an $\mathbb{F}_q$-point in $X_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ is fixed. Using Harbater's formal patching, we prove a version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which further yields a purely algebraic description of the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the $n$ generators of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ assigned to each geometric point of $B_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}}$. Based on this, we give a purely algebraic computation of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$, and thereby obtain an explicit description of the tame fundamental group of $X$.</description>
