      <title>Diff-PIC: Revolutionizing Particle-In-Cell Simulation for Advancing Nuclear Fusion with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable energy is a crucial global challenge, and recent breakthroughs in nuclear fusion ignition underscore the potential of harnessing energy extracted from nuclear fusion in everyday life, thereby drawing significant attention to fusion ignition research, especially Laser-Plasma Interaction (LPI). Unfortunately, the complexity of LPI at ignition scale renders theory-based analysis nearly impossible -- instead, it has to rely heavily on Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, which is extremely computationally intensive, making it a major bottleneck in advancing fusion ignition. In response, this work introduces Diff-PIC, a novel paradigm that leverages conditional diffusion models as a computationally efficient alternative to PIC simulations for generating high-fidelity scientific data. Specifically, we design a distillation paradigm to distill the physical patterns captured by PIC simulations into diffusion models, demonstrating both theoretical and practical feasibility. Moreover, to ensure practical effectiveness, we provide solutions for two critical challenges: (1) We develop a physically-informed conditional diffusion model that can learn and generate meaningful embeddings for mathematically continuous physical conditions. This model offers algorithmic generalization and adaptable transferability, effectively capturing the complex relationships between physical conditions and simulation outcomes; and (2) We employ the rectified flow technique to make our model a one-step conditional diffusion model, enhancing its efficiency further while maintaining high fidelity and physical validity. Diff-PIC establishes a new paradigm for using diffusion models to overcome the computational barriers in nuclear fusion research, setting a benchmark for future innovations and advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>G4CASCADE: A data-driven implementation of (n, $\gamma$) cascades in Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De-excitation $\gamma$ cascades from neutron captures form a dominant background to MeV-scale signals. The Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is widely used to model backgrounds in nuclear and particle physics experiments. While its current modules for simulating (n, $\gamma$) signals, GFNDL and G4PhotoEvaporation, are excellent for many applications, they do not reproduce known gamma-ray lines and correlations relevant at 2-15 MeV. G4CASCADE is a new data-driven Geant4 module that simulates (n, $\gamma$) de-excitation pathways, with options for how to handle shortcomings in nuclear data. Benchmark comparisons to measured gamma-ray lines and level structures in the ENSDF database show significant improvements, with decreased residuals and full energy conservation. This manuscript describes the underlying calculations performed by G4CASCADE, its various usage options, and benchmark comparisons. G4CASCADE for Geant4-10 is available on GitHub at https://github.com/UCRDarkMatter/CASCADE</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling, has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. We provide an extended detailed balance criterion for shooting methods. We affirm detailed balance for most TPS methods, but the new criteria reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

      <title>Narrowband Electromagnetic Coupling Matrix in Coupled-Resonator Microwave Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology to unleash electromagnetic coupling matrix information in coupled-resonator microwave circuits has been recently proposed [1]. This information is derived from Maxwell's equations and the natural language of electromagnetics is employed. As a result, the coupling matrix coefficients stand only for electromagnetics. In this work, we enhance this approach to reveal valuable design information for microwave engineering, showing the electromagnetic (EM) coupling among all EM resonators and ports. By the same token, the similarities with the well-known classical coupling matrix theory are addressed. We bridge this gap since the classical theory is the preferential language among microwave engineers.
  Classical coupling matrix theory is a narrowband model for electromagnetics. Thus, we carry out a narrowband approximation in the electromagnetic coupling matrix. This makes it possible to describe the EM coupling coefficients in the same framework as classical circuits. As a result, proper comparison between both coupling matrices is allowed.
  Finally, both coupling matrix approaches have a common ground, namely, get physical insight and valuable information for design purposes in coupled-resonator microwave circuits. However, only the electromagnetic coupling matrix details all EM behavior, including parasitic and leakage couplings, and the higher-order mode influence in the microwave circuit. Several microwave circuits, such as filters and diplexers, will show the possibilities of this new technique and its relation to classical coupling matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet: Deep learning for prediction of fluid fields on irregular geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 17,000 micromagnetic simulations were performed with a wide variation of geometric and magnetic parameters of different cellular nanostructures in the samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets. A forward prediction neural network (NN) model is trained to unveil the influence of these parameters on the coercivity of materials, along with the sensitivity analysis. Results indicate the important role of the 1:5-phase in enhancing coercivity. Moreover, an inverse design NN model is obtained to suggest the nanostructure for a queried coercivity.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling framework of a constrained fluid with complex boundaries using twin neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of constrained fluids have increasingly gained relevance for applications ranging from materials to biology. In this work, we propose a multiscale model using twin neural networks to investigate the properties of a fluid constrained between solid surfaces with complex shapes. The atomic scale model and the mesoscale model are connected by the coarse-grained potential which is represented by the first neural network. Then we train the second neural network model as a surrogate to predict the velocity profile of the constrained fluid with complex boundary conditions at the mesoscale. The effect of complex boundary conditions on the fluid dynamics properties and the accuracy of the neural network model prediction are systematically investigated. We demonstrate that the neural network-enhanced multiscale framework can connect simulations at atomic scale and mesoscale and reproduce the properties of a constrained fluid at mesoscale. This work provides insight into multiscale model development with the aid of machine learning techniques and the developed model can be used for modern nanotechnology applications such as enhanced oil recovery and porous materials design.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a new method for computing a finite quantum system's continuum states and observables by applying a subspace projection (or reduced basis) method used in model order reduction studies to ``discretize'' the system's continuous spectrum. The method extracts the continuum physics from solving Schr\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and emulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter emulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as well, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform methods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some informative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body systems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the method. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation studied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evidence of H-He demixing under Jupiter and Saturn conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immiscibility of hydrogen-helium mixture under the temperature and pressure conditions of planetary interiors is crucial for understanding the structures of gas giant planets (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn). While the experimental probe at such extreme conditions is challenging, theoretical simulation is heavily relied in an effort to unravel the mixing behavior of hydrogen and helium. Here we develop a method via a machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulation to quantify the physical separation of hydrogen and helium under the conditions of planetary interiors. The immiscibility line achieved with the developed method yields substantially higher demixing temperatures at pressure above 1.5 Mbar than earlier theoretical data, but matches better to the experimental estimate. Our results suggest a possibility that H-He demixing takes place in a large fraction of the interior radii of Jupiter and Saturn, i.e., 27.5% in Jupiter and 48.3% in Saturn. This indication of an H-He immiscible layer hints at the formation of helium rain and offers a potential explanation for the decrease of helium in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Development of Multicomponent Alloys in Discrete Design Space Using Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) protocol based on Active Learning (AL) principles has garnered significant attention due to its ability to optimize black-box objective functions efficiently. This capability is a prerequisite for guiding autonomous and high-throughput materials design and discovery processes. However, its application in materials science, particularly for novel alloy designs with multiple targeted properties, remains limited. This limitation is due to the computational complexity and the lack of reliable and robust acquisition functions for multiobjective optimization. In recent years, expected hypervolume-based geometrical acquisition functions have demonstrated superior performance and speed compared to other multiobjective optimization algorithms, such as Thompson Sampling Efficient Multiobjective Optimization (TSEMO), Pareto Efficient Global Optimization (parEGO), etc. This work compares several state-of-the-art multiobjective BO acquisition functions, i.e., parallel expected hypervolume improvement (qEHVI), noisy parallel expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI), parallel Pareto efficient global optimization (parEGO), and parallel noisy Pareto efficient global optimization (qNparEGO) for the multiobjective optimization of physical properties in multi-component alloys. We demonstrate the impressive performance of the qEHVI acquisition function in finding the optimum Pareto front in 1-, 2-, and 3-objective Aluminium alloy optimization problems within a limited evaluation budget and reasonable computational cost. In addition, we discuss the role of different surrogate model optimization methods from a computational cost and efficiency perspective.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>

Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>
