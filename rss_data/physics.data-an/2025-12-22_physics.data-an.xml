      <title>Generating temporal networks with the Ascona model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new sampling method for continuous-time temporal networks based on queueing processes. In particular, we focus on a Markovian version of the model where the links between nodes are Poisson distributed in time and have exponential duration. We highlight the stochastic properties of these temporal structures and leverage them to design synthetic temporal networks with a controllable level of smoothness, which follow patterns relevant for the validation and interpretation of methods for community, scale, change-point, and periodicity detection. Additionally, we show that imposing assortativity constraints on the samples leads to a continuous-time generalization of stochastic block models. Finally, we describe how variations of the model can be used to sample alternative types of structure and temporal networks, especially discrete-time ones.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Parameter Tuning on Wavelet Transform Amorphous Radial Distribution Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding atomic structures is crucial, yet amorphous materials remain challenging due to their irregular and non-periodic nature. The wavelet-transform radial distribution function (WT-RDF) offers a physics-based framework for analyzing amorphous structures, reliably predicting the first and second RDF peaks and overall curve trends in both binary Ge 0.25 Se 0.75 and ternary Ag x(Ge 0.25 Se 0.75)100-x (x=5,10,15,20,25) systems. Despite these strengths, WT-RDF shows limitations in amplitude accuracy, which affects quantitative analyses such as coordination numbers. This study addresses the issue by optimizing WT-RDF parameters using a machine learning approach, producing the enhanced WT-RDF+ framework. WT-RDF+ improves the precision of peak predictions and outperforms benchmark ML models, including RBF and LSTM, even when trained on only 25 percent of the binary dataset. These results demonstrate that WT-RDF+ is a robust and reliable model for structural characterization of amorphous materials, particularly Ge-Se systems, and support the efficient design and development of phase-change thin films for next-generation electronic devices and components.</description>

      <title>Active learning emulators for nuclear two-body scattering in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the active learning emulators for two-body scattering in coordinate space with error estimation, recently developed by Maldonado et al. in Phys. Rev. C \textbf{112}, 024002, to coupled-channel scattering in momentum space. Our full-order model (FOM) solver is based on the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for the scattering $t$-matrix as opposed to the radial Schr\"odinger equation. We use (Petrov-)Galerkin projections and high-fidelity calculations at a few snapshots across the parameter space of the interaction to construct efficient reduced-order models (ROMs), trained by a greedy algorithm for locally optimal snapshot selection. Both the FOM solver and the corresponding ROMs are implemented efficiently in Python using Google's JAX library. We present results for emulating scattering phase shifts in coupled and uncoupled channels and cross sections, and assess the accuracy of the developed ROMs and their computational speed-up factors. We also develop emulator error estimation for both the $t$-matrix and the total cross section. The software framework for reproducing and extending our results will be made publicly available. Together with our recent advances in developing active-learning emulators for three-body scattering, these emulator frameworks set the stage for full Bayesian calibrations of chiral nuclear interactions and optical models against scattering data with quantified emulator errors.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis: detecting coupling between time series of different dimensionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One challenge with the analysis of complex systems and the interaction between such systems is that they are composed of different numbers of components, or simply the fact that a different number of observables is available for each system. The challenge is how to analyze the interaction of two systems which are not described by the same number of variables. Here, we present multivariate joint recurrence quantification analysis (MvJRQA), a recurrence-based technique that allows to analyze coupling properties between multivariate datasets that differ in dimensionality (i.e., number of observables) and type of data (such as nominal or interval-scaled, for example). First, we introduce the methods, and test it on simulated data from linear and nonlinear systems. Then we apply it to an empirical dataset of EEG and eye tracking data. We introduce the joint recurrence coupling indicator (JRCI) as a measure to assess and compare coupling between systems. Finally, we discuss practical issues regarding the application of the method.</description>
