      <title>Reconstruction of Black Hole Ringdown Signals with Data Gaps using a Deep-Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks. Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a foundation for the following scientific work.</description>

      <title>MiniFool -- Physics-Constraint-Aware Minimizer-Based Adversarial Attacks in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new algorithm, MiniFool, that implements physics-inspired adversarial attacks for testing neural network-based classification tasks in particle and astroparticle physics. While we initially developed the algorithm for the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we apply it to further data from other science domains, thus demonstrating its general applicability. Here, we apply the algorithm to the well-known MNIST data set and furthermore, to Open Data data from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm is based on minimizing a cost function that combines a $\chi^2$ based test-statistic with the deviation from the desired target score. The test statistic quantifies the probability of the perturbations applied to the data based on the experimental uncertainties. For our studied use cases, we find that the likelihood of a flipped classification differs for both the initially correctly and incorrectly classified events. When testing changes of the classifications as a function of an attack parameter that scales the experimental uncertainties, the robustness of the network decision can be quantified. Furthermore, this allows testing the robustness of the classification of unlabeled experimental data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Task Learning for Particle Collision Event Reconstruction with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.</description>

      <title>Response to Comment from Robert Cousins on Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robert Cousins has posted a comment on my manuscript on ``Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution''. His key point is that one should not include in the likelihood non-physical parameter values, even for frequency statistics. This is my response, in which I contend that it can be useful to do so when discussing such descriptive statistics.</description>

      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generalizes optimization to any differentiable forward model...</description>

      <title>Unique Reconstruction From Mean-Field Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of reconstructing both the structure and dynamics of a network from mean-field measurements, which are linear combinations of node states. This setting arises in applications where only a few aggregated observations are available, making network inference challenging. We focus on the case when the number of mean-field measurements is smaller than the number of nodes. To tackle this ill-posed recovery problem, we propose a framework that combines localized initial perturbations with sparse optimization techniques. We derive sufficient conditions that guarantee the unique reconstruction of the network's adjacency matrix from mean-field data and enable recovery of node states and local governing dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across a range of sparsity and connectivity regimes. These results provide theoretical and computational foundations for inferring high-dimensional networked systems from low-dimensional observations.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>
