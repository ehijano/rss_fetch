      <title>Strassen's support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strassen's asymptotic spectrum offers a framework for analyzing the complexity of tensors. It has found applications in diverse areas, from computer science to additive combinatorics and quantum information. A long-standing open problem, dating back to 1991, asks whether Strassen's support functionals are universal spectral points, that is, points in the asymptotic spectrum of tensors.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proving that the support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals - universal spectral points that are defined via entropy optimization on entanglement polytopes. We obtain this result as a special case of a general minimax formula for convex optimization on entanglement polytopes (and other moment polytopes) that has further applications to other tensor parameters, including the asymptotic slice rank. Our proof is based on a recent Fenchel-type duality theorem on Hadamard manifolds due to Hirai.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Samplers: Typical and Worst Case Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the utility and limitations of using $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H = ([n], E)$ ($n \ge \mathrm{poly}(k)$) in the context of error reduction for randomized algorithms for decision problems with one- or two-sided error. Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.
  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = \Omega(n k^{-1} \epsilon^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\lg n+\lg(\epsilon^{-1})-\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.
  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error. Thus, despite our lower bound, for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of randomized algorithms (and inputs) for decision problems, the advantage of using IID samples over samples obtained from a uniformly random edge of a reasonable hypergraph is negligible. A similar statement holds true for randomized algorithms with two-sided error.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Weakly-Interacting Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.</description>

      <title>On Approximate Computation of Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Debt Swapping in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A debt swap is an elementary edge swap in a directed, weighted graph, where two edges with the same weight swap their targets. Debt swaps are a natural and appealing operation in financial networks, in which nodes are banks and edges represent debt contracts. They can improve the clearing payments and the stability of these networks. However, their algorithmic properties are not well-understood.
  We analyze the computational complexity of debt swapping. Our main interest lies in semi-positive swaps, in which no creditor strictly suffers and at least one strictly profits. These swaps lead to a Pareto-improvement in the entire network. We consider network optimization via sequences of v-improving debt swaps from which a given bank v strictly profits. For ranking-based clearing, we show that every sequence of semi-positive v-improving swaps has polynomial length. In contrast, for arbitrary v-improving swaps, the problem of reaching a network configuration that allows no further swaps is PLS-complete.
  In global optimization, the goal is to maximize the utility of a given bank $v$ by performing a sequence of debt swaps in the network. This problem is NP-hard to approximate for multiple types of swaps.
  Moreover, we study reachability problems -- deciding if a sequence of swaps exists between given initial and final networks. We design a polynomial-time algorithm to decide this question for arbitrary swaps and derive hardness results for several other types of swaps.
  Many of our results can be extended to networks with arbitrary monotone clearing.</description>

      <title>Dominating Set Knapsack: Profit Optimization on Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a large-scale network, we want to choose some influential nodes to make a profit by paying some cost within a limited budget so that we do not have to spend more budget on some nodes adjacent to the chosen nodes; our problem is the graph-theoretic representation of it. We define our problem, Dominating Set Knapsack, by attaching the knapsack problem with the dominating set on graphs. Each vertex $v~(\in V) $ is associated with a cost factor $w(v)$ and a profit amount $\alpha(v)$. We aim to choose some vertices within a fixed budget $(s)$ that give maximum profit so that we do not need to choose their 1-hop neighbors. We show that the Dominating Set Knapsack problem is strongly NPC even when restricted to bipartite graphs, but weakly NPC for star graphs. We present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for trees in time $O(n\cdot min\{s^2, (\alpha(V))^2\})$. We show that Dominating Set Knapsack is unlikely to be Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT) by proving that it is W[2]-hard parameterized by the solution size. We developed FPT algorithms with running time $O(4^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)} min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$ and $O(2^{vck-1}\cdot n^{O(1)} min\{s^2,{\alpha(V)}^2\})$, where $tw$ represents the $tw$ of the given graph $G(V,E)$, $vck$ is the solution size of the Vertex Cover Knapsack, $s$ is the capacity or size of the knapsack and $\alpha(V)=\sum_{v\in V}\alpha(v)$. We obtained similar results for other variants $k-$Dominating Set Knapsack and Minimal Dominating Set Knapsack, where $k$ is the size of the dominating set.</description>
