      <title>On a Theorem of Legendre on Diophantine Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legendre's theorem states that every irreducible fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ which satisfies the inequality $\left |\alpha-\frac{p}{q} \right | &lt; \frac{1}{2q^2}$ is convergent to $\alpha$. Later Barbolosi and Jager improved this theorem. In this paper we refine these results.</description>

      <title>Branch points of split degenerate superelliptic curves II: on a conjecture of Gerritzen and van der Put</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation, and let $p$ be a prime. It is known that if $\Gamma \lhd \Gamma_0 &lt; \mathrm{PGL}_2(K)$ is a Schottky group normally contained in a larger group which is generated by order-$p$ elements each fixing $2$ points $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{P}_K^1$, then the quotient of a certain subset of the projective line $\mathbb{P}_K^1$ by the action of $\Gamma$ can be algebraized as a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x) / K$. The subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consisting of these pairs $a_i, b_i$ of fixed points is mapped bijectively modulo $\Gamma$ to the set $\mathcal{B}$ of branch points of the superelliptic map $x : C \to \mathbb{P}_K^1$. A conjecture of Gerritzen and van der Put, in the case that $C$ is hyperelliptic and $K$ has residue characteristic $\neq 2$, compares the cluster data of $S$ with that of $\mathcal{B}$. We show that this conjecture requires a slight modification in order to hold and then prove a much stronger version of the modified conjecture that holds for any $p$ and any residue characteristic.</description>

      <title>On a Theorem of Nathanson on Diophantine Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, M. B. Nathanson proved that every irrational number $\alpha$ represented by a simple continued fraction with infinitely many elements greater than or equal to $k$ is approximable by an infinite number of rational numbers $p/q$ satisfying $|\alpha-p/q|&lt;1/(\sqrt{k^2+4}q^2)$. In this paper we refine this result.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{q}(t)$ with large Tate-Shafarevich groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce an explicit sequence $\left(S_a \right)_{a \geq 1}$ of abelian surfaces over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(t)$ whose Tate-Shafarevich groups are finite and large. More precisely, we establish the estimate $\left \arrowvert\mathrm{III}(S_a) \right \arrowvert = H(S_a)^{1 + o(1)}$ as $a \rightarrow \infty$, where $H(S_a)$ denotes the exponential height of $S_a$. Our method is to prove that each $S_a$ satisfies the BSD conjecture, analyse the geometry and arithmetic of its N\'eron model and give an explicit expression for its $L$-function in terms of Gauss and Kloosterman sums. By studying the relative distribution of the angles associated to these character sums, we estimate the size of the central value of $L(S_a, T)$, hence the order of $\mathrm{III}(S_a)$.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing of Second Coefficients of Hecke Polynomials on the Newspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $m \geq 1$, let $N \geq 1$ be coprime to $m$, $k \geq 2$, and $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character modulo $N$ with $\chi(-1)=(-1)^k$. Then let $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ denote the restriction of the $m$-th Hecke operator to the space $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N), \chi)$. We demonstrate that for fixed $m$ and trivial character $\chi$, the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k)$ vanishes for only finitely many pairs $(N,k)$, and we further determine the sign. To demonstrate our method, for $m=2,4$, we also compute all pairs $(N,k)$ for which the second coefficient vanishes. In the general character case, we also show that excluding an infinite family where $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N), \chi)$ is trivial, the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ vanishes for only finitely many triples $(N,k,\chi)$.</description>

      <title>A nonabelian circle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We count integral quaternion zeros of $\gamma_1^2 \pm \dots \pm \gamma_n^2$, giving an asymptotic when $n\ge 9$, and a likely near-optimal bound when $n=8$. To do so, we introduce a new, nonabelian delta symbol method, which is of independent interest. Our asymptotic at height $X$ takes the form $cX^{4n-8} + O(X^{3n+\varepsilon})$ for suitable $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0.$ We construct special subvarieties implying that, in general, $3n+\varepsilon$ can be at best improved to $3n-2.$</description>

      <title>Tamagawa number conjecture for CM modular forms and Rankin--Selberg convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $F$ with complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field $K$ such that $F(E_{\rm tors})/K$ is abelian. In this paper we prove the $p$-part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E/F$ in analytic rank $1$ for primes $p&gt;3$ split in $K$. This was previously known for $F=\mathbb{Q}$ by work of Rubin by a different method.
  We also prove a similar result for CM abelian varieties $A/K$, and for CM modular forms of higher weight.</description>

      <title>Derived Satake morphisms for $p$-small weights in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$, and let $\mathbf{G}$ denote a split, connected reductive group over $\mathcal{O}_F$. We fix a Borel subgroup $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{U}$ with maximal torus $\mathbf{T}$ and unipotent radical $\mathbf{U}$, and let $L(\lambda)$ denote an irreducible representation of $G_0 := \mathbf{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ with coefficients in a sufficiently large field of characteristic $p$. Set $G := \mathbf{G}(F)$, etc.
  Assuming $\lambda$ is a $p$-small and sufficiently regular character and that $p - 1$ is greater than the Coxeter number of $\mathbf{G}$, we show that the complex $L(U,\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)))$ splits as the orthogonal direct sum of its cohomology objects in the derived category of smooth $T$-representations in characteristic $p$. (Here $L(U, -)$ denotes Heyer's left adjoint of parabolic induction, from the derived category of smooth $G$-representations to the derived category of smooth $T$-representations.) Consequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical Hecke algebras $$\displaystyle{\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)),~\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda))\right) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda))),~\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda)))\right)}$$ indexed by $n=-[F:\mathbb{Q}_p]\dim(\mathbf{U}), \ldots, 0$, which we refer to as derived Satake morphisms. For $\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the graded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti.
  We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{N} \subset \mathbf{G}$.</description>

      <title>Splitting for integer tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider translational integer tilings by finite sets $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce a new method based on \emph{splitting}, together with a new combinatorial interpretation of some of the main tools from our earlier work. We also use splitting to prove the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture for a new class of tilings $A\oplus B=\mathbb{Z}_M$. This includes tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}p_3^{n_3}$ with $p_1&gt;p_2^{n_2-1}p_3^{n_3-1}$, and tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^2p_3^2p_4^2$ with $p_1&gt;p_2p_3p_4$, where $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ are distinct primes and $n_1,n_2,n_3\in\mathbb{N}$.
  This is the second one of the two papers replacing version 1 of arXiv:2207.11809 (the first one is available as arXiv:2207.11809 v2). The main results of this paper (Theorem 1.2, Corollaries 1.4 and 1.5) and the intermediate results in Section 4.2 are all new and did not appear previously in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 or anywhere else. The material in Sections 3, 4.1, and 5 (splitting and the splitting formulation of the slab reduction) did appear in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and has been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2. The results in Section 7 were included in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and have been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2; the proofs are shorter and (we hope) more readable.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-invariant change for abelian varieties over finite $p$-extensions of global fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the work of Lai, Longhi, Suzuki, the first two authors and study the change of $\mu$-invariants, with respect to a finite Galois p-extension $K'/K$, of an ordinary abelian variety $A$ over a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-extension of global fields $L/K$ that ramifies at a finite number of places at which $A$ has ordinary reductions. In characteristic $p&gt;0$, we obtain an explicit bound for the size $\delta_v$ of the local Galois cohomology of the Mordell-Weil group of $A$ with respect to a $p$-extension ramified at a supersingular place $v$. Next, in all characteristics, we describe the asymptotic growth of $\delta_v$ along a multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $L/K$ and provide a lower bound for the change of $\mu$-invariants of $A$ from the tower $L/K$ to the tower $LK'/K'$. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04017v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Special kinds of continued fractions have been proved to converge to transcendental real numbers by means of the celebrated Subspace Theorem. In this paper we study the analogous $p$--adic problem. More specifically, we deal with Browkin $p$--adic continued fractions. First we give some new remarks about the Browkin algorithm in terms of a $p$--adic Euclidean algorithm. Then, we focus on the heights of some $p$--adic numbers having a periodic $p$--adic continued fraction expansion and we obtain some upper bounds. Finally, we exploit these results, together with $p$--adic Roth-like results, in order to prove the transcendence of two families of $p$--adic continued fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation, and let $p$ be a prime. It is known that if $\Gamma \lhd \Gamma_0 &lt; \mathrm{PGL}_2(K)$ is a Schottky group normally contained in a larger group which is generated by order-$p$ elements each fixing $2$ points $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{P}_K^1$, then the quotient of a certain subset of the projective line $\mathbb{P}_K^1$ by the action of $\Gamma$ can be algebraized as a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x) / K$. The subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consisting of these pairs $a_i, b_i$ of fixed points is mapped modulo $\Gamma$ to the set of branch points of the superelliptic map $x : C \to \mathbb{P}_K^1$. We produce an algorithm for determining whether an input even-cardinality subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consists of fixed points of generators of such a group $\Gamma_0$ and which, in the case of a positive answer, modifies $S$ into a subset $S^{\mathrm{min}} \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ with particularly nice properties. Our results do not involve any restrictions on the prime $p$ or on the residue characteristic of $K$ and allow these to be the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the classical construction of basis for the space of Eisenstein series on a principal congruence subgroup to provide a basis for the space of Eisenstein series attached to an arbitrary congruence subgroup of $\text{Sl}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. The basis elements possess a natural parameterization by the cusps and admit an explicit description using Eisenstein series on a principal level contained in the congruence subgroup. The main tool for the construction is an equivalent formulation of the regular cusps in terms of orbits in the mod $N$ lattice that addresses the sign problem intrinsic to the series of odd weights. Our arguments also yield an elementary proof of the dimension formula for the spaces of Eisenstein series of weight $\geq 3$. We use our construction to devise a simple algorithm that allows us to determine a computable basis with algebraic Fourier coefficients for a general congruence subgroup.</description>

      <title>One-level densities in families of Gr\"ossencharakters associated to CM elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-lying zeros of a family of $L$-functions attached to the CM elliptic curves $E_d \;:\; y^2 = x^3 - dx$, for each odd and square-free integer $d$. Writing the $L$-function of $E_d$ as $L(s-\frac12, \xi_d)$ for the appropriate Gr\"ossencharakter $\xi_d$ of conductor $\mathfrak{f}_d$, the family $\mathcal{F}_d$ is defined as the family of $L$-functions attached to the Gr\"ossencharakters $\xi_{d,k}$, where for each integer $k \geq 1$, $\xi_{d, k}$ denotes the primitive character inducing $\xi_d^k$. We observe that $25\%$ of the functions in $\mathcal{F}_d$ have negative root number. This makes the symmetry type of the family (unitary, symplectic or orthogonal) somewhat mysterious, as none of the symmetry types would lead to this proportion. We give an asymptotic expression for the one-level density in the family of $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ with conductor at most $K^2 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d)$, and find that $\mathcal{F}_d$ breaks down into two natural subfamilies; namely, a symplectic family ($L(s, \xi_{d,k})$ for $k$ even) and an orthogonal family ($L(s, \xi_{d,k})$ for $k$ odd). For $k$ odd, $\mathcal{F}_d$ is in fact a subfamily of the automorphic forms of fixed level $4 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d )$, and even weight $k+1$, and this larger family also has orthogonal symmetry. Finally, we compute explicit lower order terms in decreasing powers of $\log (K^2 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d) )$ for each case.</description>

      <title>On partial derivatives of some summatory functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a real arithmetic function and let $g:[1,\infty[\to{\mathbb R}$ be a smooth function. We describe two emblematic instances in which saddle-point estimates may be used to evaluate the frequency, on the set of integers $n\leqslant x$, of the event $\{f(n)\leqslant g(n)\}$ from those relevant to the event $\{f(n)\leqslant y\}$. The first example revisits Dickman's historical contribution to the theory of friable integers. The second is concerned with the distribution of the squarefree kernel of an integer.</description>

      <title>The Action of GT-Shadows on Child's Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GT-shadows are tantalizing objects that can be thought of as approximations of elements of the mysterious Grothendieck-Teichmueller group $\widehat{GT}$ introduced by V. Drinfeld in 1990. GT-shadows form a groupoid GTSh whose objects are finite index subgroups of the pure braid group PB_4, that are normal in B_4. The goal of this paper is to describe the action of GT-shadows on Grothendieck's child's drawings and show that this action agrees with that of $\widehat{GT}$. We discuss the hierarchy of orbits of child's drawings with respect to the actions of GTSh, $\widehat{GT}$, and the absolute Galois group G_Q of rationals. We prove that the monodromy group and the passport of a child's drawing are invariant with respect to the action of the subgroupoid of charming GT-shadows. We use the action of GT-shadows on child's drawings to prove that every Abelian child's drawing admits a Belyi pair defined over rationals. Finally, we describe selected examples of non-Abelian child's drawings.</description>

      <title>On Ginzburg-Kaplan gamma factors and Bessel-Speh functions for finite general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new construction of tensor product gamma factors for a pair of irreducible representations of $\operatorname{GL}_c\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$ and $\operatorname{GL}_k\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$. This construction is a finite field analog of a construction of doubling type due to Kaplan in the local field case and due to Ginzburg in the global case, and it only assumes that one of the representations in question is generic. We use this construction to establish a relation between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations and exotic matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we establish various identities, including the multiplicativity identity of exotic matrix Kloosterman sums.</description>
