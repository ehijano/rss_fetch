      <title>Listen! It's a phase transition. The sound of a shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape-memory alloys exhibit a solid-to-solid phase transition that involves a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure and is responsible for their remarkable properties and numerous technological applications. Here, we propose a simple experiment that analyzes the sound emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures as it undergoes a transition between its austenite and martensite phases. We show that the phase transition, which occurs slightly above room temperature, can be qualitatively detected by the ear and quantitatively described using a very simple experimental setup and sound analysis tools. Such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual and engaging way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions, that is suitable for undergraduate courses.</description>

      <title>How to write competitive proposals and job applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Writing proposals and job applications is arguably one of the most important tasks in the career of a scientist. The proposed ideas must be scientifically compelling, but how a proposal is planned, written, and presented can make an enormous difference. This Perspective is the third in a series aimed at training the writing skills of professional astronomers. In the first two papers we concentrated on the writing of papers, here we concentrate on how proposals and job applications can be optimally written and presented. We discuss how to select where to propose or apply, how to optimise your writing, and add notes on the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. This guide is aimed primarily at more junior researchers, but we hope that our observations and suggestions may also be helpful for more experienced applicants, as well as for reviewers and funding agencies.</description>
