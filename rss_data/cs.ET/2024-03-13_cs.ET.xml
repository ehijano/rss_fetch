      <title>Rate-independent continuous inhibitory chemical reaction networks are Turing-universal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the model of continuous chemical reaction networks (CRNs), consisting of reactions such as $A+B \to C+D$ that can transform some continuous, nonnegative real-valued quantity (called a *concentration*) of chemical species $A$ and $B$ into equal concentrations of $C$ and $D$. Such a reaction can occur from any state in which both reactants $A$ and $B$ are present, i.e., have positive concentration. We modify the model to allow *inhibitors*, for instance, reaction $A+B \to^{I} C+D$ can occur only if the reactants $A$ and $B$ are present and the inhibitor $I$ is absent. The computational power of non-inhibitory CRNs has been studied. For instance, the reaction $X_1+X_2 \to Y$ can be thought to compute the function $f(x_1,x_2) = \min(x_1,x_2)$. Under an "adversarial" model in which reaction rates can vary arbitrarily over time, it was found that exactly the continuous, piecewise linear functions can be computed, ruling out even simple functions such as $f(x) = x^2$. In contrast, in this paper we show that inhibitory CRNs can compute any computable function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Data Management Architecture for Present Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise polynomial or exponential speed-up in solving certain problems compared to classical computers. However, in practical use, there are currently a number of fundamental technical challenges. One of them concerns the loading of data into quantum computers, since they cannot access common databases. In this vision paper, we develop a hybrid data management architecture in which databases can serve as data sources for quantum algorithms. To test the architecture, we perform experiments in which we assign data points stored in a database to clusters. For cluster assignment, a quantum algorithm processes this data by determining the distances between data points and cluster centroids.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart ecosystems are the drivers of modern society. They control critical infrastructures, ensuring their stable and sustainable operation. Smart ecosystems are governed by digital twins -- real-time virtual representations of physical infrastructure. To support the open-ended and reactive traits of smart ecosystems, digital twins need to be able to evolve in reaction to changing conditions. However, digital twin evolution is particularly challenging due to the intertwined nature of physical and software components. As a consequence, software practitioners find a substantial body of knowledge on software evolution hard to apply in digital twin evolution scenarios. In this article, we provide software practitioners with tangible leads toward understanding and managing the evolutionary concerns of digital twins. By that, we aim to bridge a significant gap in leveraging software engineering practices to develop robust smart ecosystems.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of AI-Native EDA: Promises and Challenges of Large Circuit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) domain, AI-driven solutions have emerged as formidable tools, yet they typically augment rather than redefine existing methodologies. These solutions often repurpose deep learning models from other domains, such as vision, text, and graph analytics, applying them to circuit design without tailoring to the unique complexities of electronic circuits. Such an AI4EDA approach falls short of achieving a holistic design synthesis and understanding, overlooking the intricate interplay of electrical, logical, and physical facets of circuit data. This perspective paper argues for a paradigm shift from AI4EDA towards AI-native EDA, integrating AI at the core of the design process. Pivotal to this vision is the development of a multimodal circuit representation learning technique, poised to provide a comprehensive understanding by harmonizing and extracting insights from varied data sources, such as functional specifications, RTL designs, circuit netlists, and physical layouts.
  We champion the creation of large circuit models (LCMs) that are inherently multimodal, crafted to decode and express the rich semantics and structures of circuit data, thus fostering more resilient, efficient, and inventive design methodologies. Embracing this AI-native philosophy, we foresee a trajectory that transcends the current innovation plateau in EDA, igniting a profound shift-left in electronic design methodology. The envisioned advancements herald not just an evolution of existing EDA tools but a revolution, giving rise to novel instruments of design-tools that promise to radically enhance design productivity and inaugurate a new epoch where the optimization of circuit performance, power, and area (PPA) is achieved not incrementally, but through leaps that redefine the benchmarks of electronic systems' capabilities.</description>

      <title>Towards a Dynamic Future with Adaptable Computing and Network Convergence (ACNC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of advancing 6G, a substantial paradigm shift is anticipated, highlighting comprehensive everything-to-everything interactions characterized by numerous connections and stringent adherence to Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) prerequisites. The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Optical computing with supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel photonic neural network using photonic crystal fibers, leveraging femtosecond pulse supercontinuum generation for optical computing. Investigating its efficacy across machine learning tasks, we uncover the crucial impact of nonlinear pulse propagation dynamics on network performance. Our findings show that octave-spanning supercontinuum generation results in loss of dataset variety due to many-to-one mapping, and optimal performance requires balancing optical nonlinearity. This study offers guidance for designing energy-efficient and high-performance photonic neural network architectures by explaining the interplay between nonlinear dynamics and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies for 6G Non-Terrestrial-Networks: From Academia to Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial networks form the fundamental infrastructure of modern communication systems, serving more than 4 billion users globally. However, terrestrial networks are facing a wide range of challenges, from coverage and reliability to interference and congestion. As the demands of the 6G era are expected to be much higher, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for the future. To address these problems, Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) has emerged to be a promising solution. NTNs are communication networks that leverage airborne (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) and spaceborne vehicles (e.g., satellites) to facilitate ultra-reliable communications and connectivity with high data rates and low latency over expansive regions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the utilization of network slicing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) to address diverse challenges of NTNs from the perspectives of both academia and industry. Particularly, we first provide an in-depth tutorial on NTN and the key enabling technologies including network slicing, AI/ML, and ORAN. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on how network slicing and AI/ML have been leveraged to overcome the challenges that NTNs are facing. Moreover, we present how ORAN can be utilized for NTNs. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of NTN in the 6G era.</description>
