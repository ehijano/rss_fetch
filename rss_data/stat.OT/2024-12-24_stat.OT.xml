      <title>The Landscape of College-level Data Visualization Courses, and the Benefits of Incorporating Statistical Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualization is a core part of statistical practice and is ubiquitous in many fields. Although there are numerous books on data visualization, instructors in statistics and data science may be unsure how to teach data visualization, because it is such a broad discipline. To give guidance on teaching data visualization from a statistical perspective, we make two contributions. First, we conduct a survey of data visualization courses at top colleges and universities in the United States, in order to understand the landscape of data visualization courses. We find that most courses are not taught by statistics and data science departments and do not focus on statistical topics, especially those related to inference. Instead, most courses focus on visual storytelling, aesthetic design, dashboard design, and other topics specialized for other disciplines. Second, we outline three teaching principles for incorporating statistical inference in data visualization courses, and provide several examples that demonstrate how instructors can follow these principles. The dataset from our survey allows others to explore the diversity of data visualization courses, and our teaching principles give guidance to instructors and departments who want to encourage statistical thinking via data visualization. In this way, statistics-related departments can provide a valuable perspective on data visualization that is unique to current course offerings.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Guide to Item Recovery Using the Multidimensional Graded Response Model in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to provide a step-by-step demonstration of item recovery for the Multidimensional Graded Response Model (MGRM) in R. Within this scope, a sample simulation design was constructed where the test lengths were set to 20 and 40, the interdimensional correlations were varied as 0.3 and 0.7, and the sample size was fixed at 2000. Parameter estimates were derived from the generated datasets for the 3-dimensional GRM, and bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were calculated and visualized. In line with the aim of the study, R codes for all these steps were presented along with detailed explanations, enabling researchers to replicate and adapt the procedures for their own analyses. This study is expected to contribute to the literature by serving as a practical guide for implementing item recovery in the MGRM. In addition, the methods presented, including data generation, parameter estimation, and result visualization, are anticipated to benefit researchers even if they are not directly engaged in item recovery.</description>

      <title>Doppler Power Spectrum in Channels with von Mises-Fisher Distribution of Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical analysis of the Doppler spectrum in von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering channels. A simple closed-form expression for the Doppler spectrum is derived and used to investigate the impact of vMF scattering parameters, i.e., the mean direction and the degree of concentration of scatterers. The spectrum is observed to exhibit exponential behavior for mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean direction of scatterers, while conforming to a Gaussian-like shape for the perpendicular motion. The validity of the obtained results is verified by comparison against the results of Monte Carlo simulations, where an exact match is observed.</description>

      <title>Correlation Properties in Channels with von Mises-Fisher Distribution of Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents simple analytical expressions for the spatial and temporal correlation functions in channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering. In contrast to previous results, the expressions presented here are exact and based only on elementary functions, clearly revealing the impact of the underlying parameters. The derived results are validated by a comparison against numerical integration result, where an exact match is observed. To demonstrate their utility, the presented results are used to analyze spatial correlation across different antenna array geometries and to investigate temporal correlation of a fluctuating radar signal from a moving target.</description>
