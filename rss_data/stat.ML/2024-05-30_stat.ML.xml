      <title>Large Margin Discriminative Loss for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel discriminative loss function with large margin in the context of Deep Learning. This loss boosts the discriminative power of neural nets, represented by intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. On the one hand, the class compactness is ensured by close distance of samples of the same class to each other. On the other hand, the inter-class separability is boosted by a margin loss that ensures the minimum distance of each class to its closest boundary. All the terms in our loss have an explicit meaning, giving a direct view of the feature space obtained. We analyze mathematically the relation between compactness and margin term, giving a guideline about the impact of the hyper-parameters on the learned features. Moreover, we also analyze properties of the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters of the neural net. Based on this, we design a strategy called partial momentum updating that enjoys simultaneously stability and consistency in training. Furthermore, we also investigate generalization errors to have better theoretical insights. Our loss function systematically boosts the test accuracy of models compared to the standard softmax loss in our experiments.</description>

      <title>A Margin-based Multiclass Generalization Bound via Geometric Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to better understand the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks both as a means to unlock a theoretical understanding of their success as well as providing directions for further improvements. In this paper, we investigate margin-based multiclass generalization bounds for neural networks which rely on a recent complexity measure, the geometric complexity, developed for neural networks. We derive a new upper bound on the generalization error which scales with the margin-normalized geometric complexity of the network and which holds for a broad family of data distributions and model classes. Our generalization bound is empirically investigated for a ResNet-18 model trained with SGD on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with both original and random labels.</description>

      <title>From Conformal Predictions to Confidence Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction methodologies have significantly advanced the quantification of uncertainties in predictive models. Yet, the construction of confidence regions for model parameters presents a notable challenge, often necessitating stringent assumptions regarding data distribution or merely providing asymptotic guarantees. We introduce a novel approach termed CCR, which employs a combination of conformal prediction intervals for the model outputs to establish confidence regions for model parameters. We present coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions on noise and that is valid in finite sample regime. Our approach is applicable to both split conformal predictions and black-box methodologies including full or cross-conformal approaches. In the specific case of linear models, the derived confidence region manifests as the feasible set of a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), facilitating the deduction of confidence intervals for individual parameters and enabling robust optimization. We empirically compare CCR to recent advancements in challenging settings such as with heteroskedastic and non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Rejection via Learning Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification with rejection emerges as a learning paradigm which allows models to abstain from making predictions. The predominant approach is to alter the supervised learning pipeline by augmenting typical loss functions, letting model rejection incur a lower loss than an incorrect prediction. Instead, we propose a different distributional perspective, where we seek to find an idealized data distribution which maximizes a pretrained model's performance. This can be formalized via the optimization of a loss's risk with a $ \phi$-divergence regularization term. Through this idealized distribution, a rejection decision can be made by utilizing the density ratio between this distribution and the data distribution. We focus on the setting where our $ \phi $-divergences are specified by the family of $ \alpha $-divergence. Our framework is tested empirically over clean and noisy datasets.</description>

      <title>Federated Q-Learning with Reference-Advantage Decomposition: Almost Optimal Regret and Logarithmic Communication Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider model-free federated reinforcement learning for tabular episodic Markov decision processes. Under the coordination of a central server, multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal policy without sharing their raw data. Despite recent advances in federated Q-learning algorithms achieving near-linear regret speedup with low communication cost, existing algorithms only attain suboptimal regrets compared to the information bound. We propose a novel model-free federated Q-learning algorithm, termed FedQ-Advantage. Our algorithm leverages reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction and operates under two distinct mechanisms: synchronization between the agents and the server, and policy update, both triggered by events. We prove that our algorithm not only requires a lower logarithmic communication cost but also achieves an almost optimal regret, reaching the information bound up to a logarithmic factor and near-linear regret speedup compared to its single-agent counterpart when the time horizon is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Deep Positive-Unlabeled Anomaly Detection for Contaminated Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised anomaly detection, which aims to improve the performance of the anomaly detector by using a small amount of anomaly data in addition to unlabeled data, has attracted attention. Existing semi-supervised approaches assume that unlabeled data are mostly normal. They train the anomaly detector to minimize the anomaly scores for the unlabeled data, and to maximize those for the anomaly data. However, in practice, the unlabeled data are often contaminated with anomalies. This weakens the effect of maximizing the anomaly scores for anomalies, and prevents us from improving the detection performance. To solve this problem, we propose the positive-unlabeled autoencoder, which is based on positive-unlabeled learning and the anomaly detector such as the autoencoder. With our approach, we can approximate the anomaly scores for normal data using the unlabeled and anomaly data. Therefore, without the labeled normal data, we can train the anomaly detector to minimize the anomaly scores for normal data, and to maximize those for the anomaly data. In addition, our approach is applicable to various anomaly detectors such as the DeepSVDD. Experiments on various datasets show that our approach achieves better detection performance than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>EntProp: High Entropy Propagation for Improving Accuracy and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution domains that are different from those in training despite their impressive performance. In practical applications, it is important for DNNs to have both high standard accuracy and robustness against out-of-distribution domains. One technique that achieves both of these improvements is disentangled learning with mixture distribution via auxiliary batch normalization layers (ABNs). This technique treats clean and transformed samples as different domains, allowing a DNN to learn better features from mixed domains. However, if we distinguish the domains of the samples based on entropy, we find that some transformed samples are drawn from the same domain as clean samples, and these samples are not completely different domains. To generate samples drawn from a completely different domain than clean samples, we hypothesize that transforming clean high-entropy samples to further increase the entropy generates out-of-distribution samples that are much further away from the in-distribution domain. On the basis of the hypothesis, we propose high entropy propagation~(EntProp), which feeds high-entropy samples to the network that uses ABNs. We introduce two techniques, data augmentation and free adversarial training, that increase entropy and bring the sample further away from the in-distribution domain. These techniques do not require additional training costs. Our experimental results show that EntProp achieves higher standard accuracy and robustness with a lower training cost than the baseline methods. In particular, EntProp is highly effective at training on small datasets.</description>

      <title>A Mallows-like Criterion for Anomaly Detection with Random Forest Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of anomaly signal detection can be significantly undermined by the inherent uncertainty of relying on one specified model. Under the framework of model average methods, this paper proposes a novel criterion to select the weights on aggregation of multiple models, wherein the focal loss function accounts for the classification of extremely imbalanced data. This strategy is further integrated into Random Forest algorithm by replacing the conventional voting method. We have evaluated the proposed method on benchmark datasets across various domains, including network intrusion. The findings indicate that our proposed method not only surpasses the model averaging with typical loss functions but also outstrips common anomaly detection algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) extends traditional variational families with semi-implicit distributions defined in a hierarchical manner. Due to the intractable densities of semi-implicit distributions, classical SIVI often resorts to surrogates of evidence lower bound (ELBO) that would introduce biases for training. A recent advancement in SIVI, named SIVI-SM, utilizes an alternative score matching objective made tractable via a minimax formulation, albeit requiring an additional lower-level optimization. In this paper, we propose kernel SIVI (KSIVI), a variant of SIVI-SM that eliminates the need for lower-level optimization through kernel tricks. Specifically, we show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the lower-level problem has an explicit solution. This way, the upper-level objective becomes the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which is readily computable for stochastic gradient descent due to the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational distributions. An upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo gradient estimators of the KSD objective is derived, which allows us to establish novel convergence guarantees of KSIVI. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of KSIVI on both synthetic distributions and a variety of real data Bayesian inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Neural Implicit Solvers for multiscale, parametric PDEs with applications in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Physics-Aware Neural Implicit Solvers (PANIS), a novel, data-driven framework for learning surrogates for parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It consists of a probabilistic, learning objective in which weighted residuals are used to probe the PDE and provide a source of {\em virtual} data i.e. the actual PDE never needs to be solved. This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can accommodate and generalize several existing learning objectives and architectures while yielding probabilistic surrogates that can quantify predictive uncertainty.</description>

      <title>State Space Models are Comparable to Transformers in Estimating Functions with Dynamic Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks based on state space models (SSMs) are attracting much attention in sequence modeling since their computational cost is significantly smaller than that of Transformers. While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have extended notions of feature importance to \emph{semantic concepts} that are inherently interpretable to the users interacting with a black-box predictive model. Yet, precise statistical guarantees, such as false positive rate control, are needed to communicate findings transparently and to avoid unintended consequences in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formalize the global (i.e., over a population) and local (i.e., for a sample) statistical importance of semantic concepts for the predictions of opaque models, by means of conditional independence, which allows for rigorous testing. We use recent ideas of sequential kernelized testing (SKIT) to induce a rank of importance across concepts, and showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework on synthetic datasets as well as on image classification tasks using vision-language models such as CLIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) on Riemannian manifolds have garnered increasing interest in various applied areas. For instance, DNNs on spherical and hyperbolic manifolds have been designed to solve a wide range of computer vision and nature language processing tasks. One of the key factors that contribute to the success of these networks is that spherical and hyperbolic manifolds have the rich algebraic structures of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces. This enables principled and effective generalizations of the most successful DNNs to these manifolds. Recently, some works have shown that many concepts in the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces can also be generalized to matrix manifolds such as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and Grassmann manifolds. As a result, some building blocks for SPD and Grassmann neural networks, e.g., isometric models and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) can be derived in a way that is fully analogous to their spherical and hyperbolic counterparts. Building upon these works, we design fully-connected (FC) and convolutional layers for SPD neural networks. We also develop MLR on Symmetric Positive Semi-definite (SPSD) manifolds, and propose a method for performing backpropagation with the Grassmann logarithmic map in the projector perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the human action recognition and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful black-box models which have shown impressive empirical performance. However, without any form of uncertainty quantification, it can be difficult to trust such models in high-risk scenarios. Conformal prediction aims to address this problem, however, an assumption of exchangeability is required for its validity which has limited its applicability to static graphs and transductive regimes. We propose to use unfolding, which allows any existing static GNN to output a dynamic graph embedding with exchangeability properties. Using this, we extend the validity of conformal prediction to dynamic GNNs in both transductive and semi-inductive regimes. We provide a theoretical guarantee of valid conformal prediction in these cases and demonstrate the empirical validity, as well as the performance gains, of unfolded GNNs against standard GNN architectures on both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-CATE: Multi-Accurate Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation Robust to Unknown Covariate Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is important to tailor treatments to those individuals who would most likely benefit. However, conditional average treatment effect predictors may often be trained on one population but possibly deployed on different, possibly unknown populations. We use methodology for learning multi-accurate predictors to post-process CATE T-learners (differenced regressions) to become robust to unknown covariate shifts at the time of deployment. The method works in general for pseudo-outcome regression, such as the DR-learner. We show how this approach can combine (large) confounded observational and (smaller) randomized datasets by learning a confounded predictor from the observational dataset, and auditing for multi-accuracy on the randomized controlled trial. We show improvements in bias and mean squared error in simulations with increasingly larger covariate shift, and on a semi-synthetic case study of a parallel large observational study and smaller randomized controlled experiment. Overall, we establish a connection between methods developed for multi-distribution learning and achieve appealing desiderata (e.g. external validity) in causal inference and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Improving Linear System Solvers for Hyperparameter Optimisation in Iterative Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling hyperparameter optimisation to very large datasets remains an open problem in the Gaussian process community. This paper focuses on iterative methods, which use linear system solvers, like conjugate gradients, alternating projections or stochastic gradient descent, to construct an estimate of the marginal likelihood gradient. We discuss three key improvements which are applicable across solvers: (i) a pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions, (ii) warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias, (iii) early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps. These techniques provide speed-ups of up to $72\times$ when solving to tolerance, and decrease the average residual norm by up to $7\times$ when stopping early.</description>

Abstract: In the current field of clinical medicine, traditional methods for analyzing recurrent events have limitations when dealing with complex time-dependent data. This study combines Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with the Cox model to enhance the model's performance in analyzing recurrent events with dynamic temporal information. Compared to classical models, the LSTM-Cox model significantly improves the accuracy of extracting clinical risk features and exhibits lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, while maintaining good performance on simulated datasets. In an empirical analysis of bladder cancer recurrence data, the model successfully reduced the mean squared error during the training phase and achieved a Concordance index of up to 0.90 on the test set. Furthermore, the model effectively distinguished between high and low-risk patient groups, and the identified recurrence risk features such as the number of tumor recurrences and maximum size were consistent with other research and clinical trial results. This study not only provides a straightforward and efficient method for analyzing recurrent data and extracting features but also offers a convenient pathway for integrating deep learning techniques into clinical risk prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Single-loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18577v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively. It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Armed Bandits with Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online experimentation with interference is a common challenge in modern applications such as e-commerce and adaptive clinical trials in medicine. For example, in online marketplaces, the revenue of a good depends on discounts applied to competing goods. Statistical inference with interference is widely studied in the offline setting, but far less is known about how to adaptively assign treatments to minimize regret. We address this gap by studying a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem where a learner (e-commerce platform) sequentially assigns one of possible $\mathcal{A}$ actions (discounts) to $N$ units (goods) over $T$ rounds to minimize regret (maximize revenue). Unlike traditional MAB problems, the reward of each unit depends on the treatments assigned to other units, i.e., there is interference across the underlying network of units. With $\mathcal{A}$ actions and $N$ units, minimizing regret is combinatorially difficult since the action space grows as $\mathcal{A}^N$. To overcome this issue, we study a sparse network interference model, where the reward of a unit is only affected by the treatments assigned to $s$ neighboring units. We use tools from discrete Fourier analysis to develop a sparse linear representation of the unit-specific reward $r_n: [\mathcal{A}]^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $, and propose simple, linear regression-based algorithms to minimize regret. Importantly, our algorithms achieve provably low regret both when the learner observes the interference neighborhood for all units and when it is unknown. This significantly generalizes other works on this topic which impose strict conditions on the strength of interference on a known network, and also compare regret to a markedly weaker optimal action. Empirically, we corroborate our theoretical findings via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Understanding of Self-Correction through In-context Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these findings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as defending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make a large difference. We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.</description>

      <title>Provable Contrastive Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning requires learning incremental tasks with dynamic data distributions. So far, it has been observed that employing a combination of contrastive loss and distillation loss for training in continual learning yields strong performance. To the best of our knowledge, however, this contrastive continual learning framework lacks convincing theoretical explanations. In this work, we fill this gap by establishing theoretical performance guarantees, which reveal how the performance of the model is bounded by training losses of previous tasks in the contrastive continual learning framework. Our theoretical explanations further support the idea that pre-training can benefit continual learning. Inspired by our theoretical analysis of these guarantees, we propose a novel contrastive continual learning algorithm called CILA, which uses adaptive distillation coefficients for different tasks. These distillation coefficients are easily computed by the ratio between average distillation losses and average contrastive losses from previous tasks. Our method shows great improvement on standard benchmarks and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Attention Masks and LayerNorm in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention is the key mechanism of transformers, which are the essential building blocks of modern foundation models. Recent studies have shown that pure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth increases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth. The existing literature on rank collapse, however, has mostly overlooked other critical components in transformers that may alleviate the rank collapse issue. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer normalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked attention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, local masked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of self-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value matrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However, through construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with proper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge to a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can simultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between one and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays no role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention with LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear dynamical system than what was originally thought.</description>

      <title>Principled Probabilistic Imaging using Diffusion Models as Plug-and-Play Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently shown outstanding capability in modeling complex image distributions, making them expressive image priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. However, most existing DM-based methods rely on approximations in the generative process to be generic to different inverse problems, leading to inaccurate sample distributions that deviate from the target posterior defined within the Bayesian framework. To harness the generative power of DMs while avoiding such approximations, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that performs posterior sampling for general inverse problems by reducing it to sampling the posterior of a Gaussian denoising problem. Crucially, we leverage a general DM formulation as a unified interface that allows for rigorously solving the denoising problem with a range of state-of-the-art DMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six inverse problems (three linear and three nonlinear), including a real-world black hole imaging problem. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method offers more accurate reconstructions and posterior estimation compared to existing DM-based imaging inverse methods.</description>

      <title>CHANI: Correlation-based Hawkes Aggregation of Neurons with bio-Inspiration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work aims at proving mathematically that a neural network inspired by biology can learn a classification task thanks to local transformations only. In this purpose, we propose a spiking neural network named CHANI (Correlation-based Hawkes Aggregation of Neurons with bio-Inspiration), whose neurons activity is modeled by Hawkes processes. Synaptic weights are updated thanks to an expert aggregation algorithm, providing a local and simple learning rule. We were able to prove that our network can learn on average and asymptotically. Moreover, we demonstrated that it automatically produces neuronal assemblies in the sense that the network can encode several classes and that a same neuron in the intermediate layers might be activated by more than one class, and we provided numerical simulations on synthetic dataset. This theoretical approach contrasts with the traditional empirical validation of biologically inspired networks and paves the way for understanding how local learning rules enable neurons to form assemblies able to represent complex concepts.</description>

      <title>Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\min_{\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}}\lVert(\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{W})\mathbf{X}^\top\rVert_{\rm F}^2$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter. The implementation is available at: \href{https://github.com/pilancilab/caldera}{https://github.com/pilancilab/caldera}.</description>

      <title>A Causal Framework for Evaluating Deferring Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deferring systems extend supervised Machine Learning (ML) models with the possibility to defer predictions to human experts. However, evaluating the impact of a deferring strategy on system accuracy is still an overlooked area. This paper fills this gap by evaluating deferring systems through a causal lens. We link the potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems. This allows us to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy. We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we can access both the human and the ML model predictions for the deferred instances. In such a case, we can identify the individual causal effects for deferred instances and aggregates of them. In the second scenario, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. In this case, we can resort to regression discontinuity design to estimate a local causal effect. We empirically evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems from the literature.</description>

      <title>MANO: Exploiting Matrix Norm for Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation Under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the models' outputs, specifically the logits, is a common approach to estimating the test accuracy of a pre-trained neural network on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without requiring access to the corresponding ground truth labels. Despite their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, current logit-based methods are vulnerable to overconfidence issues, leading to prediction bias, especially under the natural shift. In this work, we first study the relationship between logits and generalization performance from the view of low-density separation assumption. Our findings motivate our proposed method MaNo which (1) applies a data-dependent normalization on the logits to reduce prediction bias, and (2) takes the $L_p$ norm of the matrix of normalized logits as the estimation score. Our theoretical analysis highlights the connection between the provided score and the model's uncertainty. We conduct an extensive empirical study on common unsupervised accuracy estimation benchmarks and demonstrate that MaNo achieves state-of-the-art performance across various architectures in the presence of synthetic, natural, or subpopulation shifts.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates sparse high-dimensional linear regression, particularly examining the properties of the posterior under conditions of random design and unknown error variance. We provide consistency results for the posterior and analyze its concentration rates, demonstrating adaptiveness to the unknown sparsity level of the regression coefficient vector. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to establish concentration outcomes for parameter estimation using specific distance measures. These findings are in line with recent discoveries in frequentist studies. Additionally, by employing techniques to address model misspecification through a fractional posterior, we broaden our analysis through oracle inequalities to encompass the critical aspect of model misspecification for the regular posterior. Our novel findings are demonstrated using two different types of sparsity priors: a shrinkage prior and a spike-and-slab prior.</description>

Abstract: The practical use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in engineering applications imposes special requirements: high sampling efficiency on the one hand and finding a robust solution on the other hand. We address the case of adversarial robustness, where all parameters are controllable during the optimization process, but a subset of them is uncontrollable or even adversely perturbed at the time of application. To this end, we develop an efficient information-based acquisition function that we call Robust Entropy Search (RES). We empirically demonstrate its benefits in experiments on synthetic and real-life data. The results showthat RES reliably finds robust optima, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Black-box Adversarial Attacks via Bayesian Optimization Guided by a Function Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the challenging black-box adversarial attack that aims to generate adversarial examples against a black-box model by only using output feedback of the model to input queries. Some previous methods improve the query efficiency by incorporating the gradient of a surrogate white-box model into query-based attacks due to the adversarial transferability. However, the localized gradient is not informative enough, making these methods still query-intensive. In this paper, we propose a Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization (P-BO) algorithm that leverages the surrogate model as a global function prior in black-box adversarial attacks. As the surrogate model contains rich prior information of the black-box one, P-BO models the attack objective with a Gaussian process whose mean function is initialized as the surrogate model's loss. Our theoretical analysis on the regret bound indicates that the performance of P-BO may be affected by a bad prior. Therefore, we further propose an adaptive integration strategy to automatically adjust a coefficient on the function prior by minimizing the regret bound. Extensive experiments on image classifiers and large vision-language models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in reducing queries and improving attack success rates compared with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks.

Abstract: We develop algorithms for online linear regression which achieve optimal static and dynamic regret guarantees \emph{even in the complete absence of prior knowledge}. We present a novel analysis showing that a discounted variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth forecaster achieves dynamic regret of the form $R_{T}(\vec{u})\le O\left(d\log(T)\vee \sqrt{dP_{T}^{\gamma}(\vec{u})T}\right)$, where $P_{T}^{\gamma}(\vec{u})$ is a measure of variability of the comparator sequence, and show that the discount factor achieving this result can be learned on-the-fly. We show that this result is optimal by providing a matching lower bound. We also extend our results to \emph{strongly-adaptive} guarantees which hold over every sub-interval $[a,b]\subseteq[1,T]$ simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates a local asymptotic minimax optimal strategy for fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI). We propose the Adaptive Generalized Neyman Allocation (AGNA) strategy and show that its worst-case upper bound of the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our strategy corresponds to a generalization of the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and a refinement of existing strategies such as the ones proposed by Glynn &amp; Juneja (2004) and Shin et al. (2018). Compared to Komiyama et al. (2022), which proposes a minimax rate-optimal strategy, our proposed strategy has a tighter upper bound that exactly matches the lower bound, including the constant terms, by restricting the class of distributions to the class of small-gap distributions. Our result contributes to the longstanding open issue about the existence of asymptotically optimal strategies in fixed-budget BAI, by presenting the local asymptotic minimax optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Online and Offline RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.</description>

      <title>MRCpy: A Library for Minimax Risk Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Libraries for supervised classification have enabled the wide-spread usage of machine learning methods. Existing libraries, such as scikit-learn, caret, and mlpack, implement techniques based on the classical empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach. We present a Python library, MRCpy, that implements minimax risk classifiers (MRCs) based on the robust risk minimization (RRM) approach. The library offers multiple variants of MRCs that can provide performance guarantees, enable efficient learning in high dimensions, and adapt to distribution shifts. MRCpy follows an object-oriented approach and adheres to the standards of popular Python libraries, such as scikit-learn, facilitating readability and easy usage together with a seamless integration with other libraries. The source code is available under the GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCpy.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Competing Matching Recommendation Markets With Quota and Complementary Preferences Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new recommendation algorithm for addressing the problem of two-sided online matching markets with complementary preferences and quota constraints, where agents' preferences are unknown a priori and must be learned from data. The presence of mixed quota and complementary preferences constraints can lead to instability in the matching process, making this problem challenging to solve. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the problem as a bandit learning framework and propose the Multi-agent Multi-type Thompson Sampling (MMTS) algorithm. The algorithm combines the strengths of Thompson Sampling for exploration with a new double matching technique to provide a stable matching outcome. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of MMTS as it can achieve stability and has a total $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(Q{\sqrt{K_{\max}T}})$-Bayesian regret with high probability, which exhibits linearity with respect to the total firm's quota $Q$, the square root of the maximum size of available type workers $\sqrt{K_{\max}}$ and time horizon $T$. In addition, simulation studies also demonstrate MMTS's effectiveness in various settings. We provide code used in our experiments \url{https://github.com/Likelyt/Double-Matching}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximate sampling from non-log-concave distributions, e.g., Gaussian mixtures, which is often challenging even in low dimensions due to their multimodality. We focus on performing this task via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from discretizations of the overdamped Langevin diffusions, which are commonly known as Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms. Furthermore, we are also interested in two nonsmooth cases for which a large class of proximal MCMC methods have been developed: (i) a nonsmooth prior is considered with a Gaussian mixture likelihood; (ii) a Laplacian mixture distribution. Such nonsmooth and non-log-concave sampling tasks arise from a wide range of applications to Bayesian inference and imaging inverse problems such as image deconvolution. We perform numerical simulations to compare the performance of most commonly used Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16905v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural additive models (NAMs) enhance the transparency of deep neural networks by handling input features in separate additive sub-networks. However, they lack inherent mechanisms that provide calibrated uncertainties and enable selection of relevant features and interactions. Approaching NAMs from a Bayesian perspective, we augment them in three primary ways, namely by a) providing credible intervals for the individual additive sub-networks; b) estimating the marginal likelihood to perform an implicit selection of features via an empirical Bayes procedure; and c) facilitating the ranking of feature pairs as candidates for second-order interaction in fine-tuned models. In particular, we develop Laplace-approximated NAMs (LA-NAMs), which show improved empirical performance on tabular datasets and challenging real-world medical tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Properties and Estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pointwise mutual information profile, or simply profile, is the distribution of pointwise mutual information for a given pair of random variables. One of its important properties is that its expected value is precisely the mutual information between these random variables. In this paper, we analytically describe the profiles of multivariate normal distributions and introduce a novel family of distributions, Bend and Mix Models, for which the profile can be accurately estimated using Monte Carlo methods. We then show how Bend and Mix Models can be used to study the limitations of existing mutual information estimators, investigate the behavior of neural critics used in variational estimators, and understand the effect of experimental outliers on mutual information estimation. Finally, we show how Bend and Mix Models can be used to obtain model-based Bayesian estimates of mutual information, suitable for problems with available domain expertise in which uncertainty quantification is necessary.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic variable importance for predictive uncertainty: an entropy-based approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to trust the predictions of a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to understand the factors that contribute to those predictions. In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the reasons for the model's level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model's predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches to understand both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance.</description>

Abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Sobolev Transport for Probability Measures on a Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal transport (OT) problem for measures supported on a graph metric space. Recently, Le et al. (2022) leverage the graph structure and propose a variant of OT, namely Sobolev transport (ST), which yields a closed-form expression for a fast computation. However, ST is essentially coupled with the $L^p$ geometric structure within its definition which makes it nontrivial to utilize ST for other prior structures. In contrast, the classic OT has the flexibility to adapt to various geometric structures by modifying the underlying cost function. An important instance is the Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) which moves beyond the $L^p$ structure by leveraging the \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}. Comparing to the usage of standard $p$-order Wasserstein, OW remarkably helps to advance certain machine learning approaches. Nevertheless, OW brings up a new challenge on its computation due to its two-level optimization formulation. In this work, we leverage a specific class of convex functions for Orlicz structure to propose the generalized Sobolev transport (GST). GST encompasses the ST as its special case, and can be utilized for prior structures beyond the $L^p$ geometry. In connection with the OW, we show that one only needs to simply solve a univariate optimization problem to compute the GST, unlike the complex two-level optimization problem in OW. We empirically illustrate that GST is several-order faster than the OW. Moreover, we provide preliminary evidences on the advantages of GST for document classification and for several tasks in topological data analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Bayesian experimental design for non-exchangeable data that formulates it as risk-sensitive policy optimization. We develop the Inside-Out SMC$^2$ algorithm, a nested sequential Monte Carlo technique to infer optimal designs, and embed it into a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to perform gradient-based policy amortization. Our approach is distinct from other amortized experimental design techniques, as it does not rely on contrastive estimators. Numerical validation on a set of dynamical systems showcases the efficacy of our method in comparison to other state-of-the-art strategies.</description>

      <title>Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of active learning, we propose active inference$\unicode{x2013}$a methodology for statistical inference with machine-learning-assisted data collection. Assuming a budget on the number of labels that can be collected, the methodology uses a machine learning model to identify which data points would be most beneficial to label, thus effectively utilizing the budget. It operates on a simple yet powerful intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits uncertainty, and rely on the model's predictions where it is confident. Active inference constructs provably valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals and more powerful p-values. We evaluate active inference on datasets from public opinion research, census analysis, and proteomics.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic framework that generates prediction intervals for datasets with complete or missing data. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, enabling it to extract latent representations for uncertainty estimation. The framework demonstrates robustness through extensive empirical evaluation across 11 tabular datasets, achieving$\unicode{x2013}$in some cases$\unicode{x2013}$narrower normalized prediction intervals and higher coverage than traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, SEMF integrates seamlessly with existing machine learning algorithms, such as gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, exemplifying its usefulness for real-world applications. The experimental results highlight SEMF's potential to advance state-of-the-art techniques in uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1504.06817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a relative error bound for nuclear norm regularized matrix completion, with the focus on the completion of full-rank matrices. Under the assumption that the top eigenspaces of the target matrix are incoherent, we derive a relative upper bound for recovering the best low-rank approximation of the unknown matrix. Although multiple works have been devoted to analyzing the recovery error of full-rank matrix completion, their error bounds are usually additive, making it impossible to obtain the perfect recovery case and more generally difficult to leverage the skewed distribution of eigenvalues. Our analysis is built upon the optimality condition of the regularized formulation and existing guarantees for low-rank matrix completion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first relative bound that has been proved for the regularized formulation of matrix completion.</description>

      <title>Statistical Linear Models in Virus Genomic Alignment-free Classification: Application to Hepatitis C Viruses</title>

Abstract: Viral sequence classification is an important task in pathogen detection, epidemiological surveys and evolutionary studies. Statistical learning methods are widely used to classify and identify viral sequences in samples from environments. These methods face several challenges associated with the nature and properties of viral genomes such as recombination, mutation rate and diversity. Also, new generations of sequencing technologies rise other difficulties by generating massive amounts of fragmented sequences. While linear classifiers are often used to classify viruses, there is a lack of exploration of the accuracy space of existing models in the context of alignment free approaches. In this study, we present an exhaustive assessment procedure exploring the power of linear classifiers in genotyping and subtyping partial and complete genomes. It is applied to the Hepatitis C viruses (HCV). Several variables are considered in this investigation such as classifier types (generative and discriminative) and their hyper-parameters (smoothing value and regularization penalty function), the classification task (genotyping and subtyping), the length of the tested sequences (partial and complete) and the length of k-mer words. Overall, several classifiers perform well given a set of precise combination of the experimental variables mentioned above. Finally, we provide the procedure and benchmark data to allow for more robust assessment of classification from virus genomes.</description>

Abstract: Generalization is an important feature of neural network, and there have been many studies on it. Recently, with the development of quantum compu-ting, it brings new opportunities. In this paper, we studied a class of quantum neural network constructed by quantum gate. In this model, we mapped the feature data to a quantum state in Hilbert space firstly, and then implement unitary evolution on it, in the end, we can get the classification result by im-plement measurement on the quantum state. Since all the operations in quan-tum neural networks are unitary, the parameters constitute a hypersphere of Hilbert space. Compared with traditional neural network, the parameter space is flatter. Therefore, it is not easy to fall into local optimum, which means the quantum neural networks have better generalization. In order to validate our proposal, we evaluated our model on three public datasets, the results demonstrated that our model has better generalization than the classical neu-ral network with the same structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Matching Bandit For Two-Sided Online Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-sided online matching platforms are employed in various markets. However, agents' preferences in the current market are usually implicit and unknown, thus needing to be learned from data. With the growing availability of dynamic side information involved in the decision process, modern online matching methodology demands the capability to track shifting preferences for agents based on contextual information. This motivates us to propose a novel framework for this dynamic online matching problem with contextual information, which allows for dynamic preferences in matching decisions. Existing works focus on online matching with static preferences, but this is insufficient: the two-sided preference changes as soon as one side's contextual information updates, resulting in non-static matching. In this paper, we propose a dynamic matching bandit algorithm to adapt to this problem. The key component of the proposed dynamic matching algorithm is an online estimation of the preference ranking with a statistical guarantee. Theoretically, we show that the proposed dynamic matching algorithm delivers an agent-optimal stable matching result with high probability. In particular, we prove a logarithmic regret upper bound $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ and construct a corresponding instance-dependent matching regret lower bound. In the experiments, we demonstrate that dynamic matching algorithm is robust to various preference schemes, dimensions of contexts, reward noise levels, and context variation levels, and its application to a job-seeking market further demonstrates the practical usage of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Algorithmically Designed Artificial Neural Networks (ADANNs): Higher order deep operator learning for parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a new deep learning approach to approximate operators related to parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we introduce a new strategy to design specific artificial neural network (ANN) architectures in conjunction with specific ANN initialization schemes which are tailor-made for the particular approximation problem under consideration. In the proposed approach we combine efficient classical numerical approximation techniques with deep operator learning methodologies. Specifically, we introduce customized adaptions of existing ANN architectures together with specialized initializations for these ANN architectures so that at initialization we have that the ANNs closely mimic a chosen efficient classical numerical algorithm for the considered approximation problem. The obtained ANN architectures and their initialization schemes are thus strongly inspired by numerical algorithms as well as by popular deep learning methodologies from the literature and in that sense we refer to the introduced ANNs in conjunction with their tailor-made initialization schemes as Algorithmically Designed Artificial Neural Networks (ADANNs). We numerically test the proposed ADANN methodology in the case of several parametric PDEs. In the tested numerical examples the ADANN methodology significantly outperforms existing traditional approximation algorithms as well as existing deep operator learning methodologies from the literature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Collapse: How Gradient Noise Attracts SGD Dynamics Towards Simpler Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal a strong implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that drives overly expressive networks to much simpler subnetworks, thereby dramatically reducing the number of independent parameters, and improving generalization. To reveal this bias, we identify invariant sets, or subsets of parameter space that remain unmodified by SGD. We focus on two classes of invariant sets that correspond to simpler (sparse or low-rank) subnetworks and commonly appear in modern architectures. Our analysis uncovers that SGD exhibits a property of stochastic attractivity towards these simpler invariant sets. We establish a sufficient condition for stochastic attractivity based on a competition between the loss landscape's curvature around the invariant set and the noise introduced by stochastic gradients. Remarkably, we find that an increased level of noise strengthens attractivity, leading to the emergence of attractive invariant sets associated with saddle-points or local maxima of the train loss. We observe empirically the existence of attractive invariant sets in trained deep neural networks, implying that SGD dynamics often collapses to simple subnetworks with either vanishing or redundant neurons. We further demonstrate how this simplifying process of stochastic collapse benefits generalization in a linear teacher-student framework. Finally, through this analysis, we mechanistically explain why early training with large learning rates for extended periods benefits subsequent generalization.</description>

      <title>On the Disconnect Between Theory and Practice of Neural Networks: Limits of the NTK Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has garnered significant attention as a theoretical framework for describing the behavior of large-scale neural networks. Kernel methods are theoretically well-understood and as a result enjoy algorithmic benefits, which can be demonstrated to hold in wide synthetic neural network architectures. These advantages include faster optimization, reliable uncertainty quantification and improved continual learning. However, current results quantifying the rate of convergence to the kernel regime suggest that exploiting these benefits requires architectures that are orders of magnitude wider than they are deep. This assumption raises concerns that architectures used in practice do not exhibit behaviors as predicted by the NTK. Here, we supplement previous work on the NTK by empirically investigating whether the limiting regime predicts practically relevant behavior of large-width architectures. Our results demonstrate that this is not the case across multiple domains. This observed disconnect between theory and practice further calls into question to what degree NTK theory should inform architectural and algorithmic choices.</description>

      <title>On the Error-Propagation of Inexact Hotelling's Deflation for Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) aims to find subspaces spanned by the so-called principal components that best represent the variance in the dataset. The deflation method is a popular meta-algorithm that sequentially finds individual principal components, starting from the most important ones and working towards the less important ones. However, as deflation proceeds, numerical errors from the imprecise estimation of principal components propagate due to its sequential nature. This paper mathematically characterizes the error propagation of the inexact Hotelling's deflation method. We consider two scenarios: $i)$ when the sub-routine for finding the leading eigenvector is abstract and can represent various algorithms; and $ii)$ when power iteration is used as the sub-routine. In the latter case, the additional directional information from power iteration allows us to obtain a tighter error bound than the sub-routine agnostic case. For both scenarios, we explicitly characterize how the errors progress and affect subsequent principal component estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are becoming the go-to solution for the ever-growing number of tasks. However, with growing capacity, models are prone to rely on spurious correlations stemming from biases and stereotypes present in the training data. This work proposes a novel method for detecting and mitigating gender bias in language models. We perform causal analysis to identify problematic model components and discover that mid-upper feed-forward layers are most prone to convey bias. Based on the analysis results, we intervene in the model by applying a linear projection to the weight matrices of these layers. Our titular method, DAMA, significantly decreases bias as measured by diverse metrics while maintaining the model's performance on downstream tasks. We release code for our method and models, which retrain LLaMA's state-of-the-art performance while being significantly less biased.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent with Polyak's Momentum Finds Flatter Minima via Large Catapults</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although gradient descent with Polyak's momentum is widely used in modern machine and deep learning, a concrete understanding of its effects on the training trajectory remains elusive. In this work, we empirically show that for linear diagonal networks and nonlinear neural networks, momentum gradient descent with a large learning rate displays large catapults, driving the iterates towards much flatter minima than those found by gradient descent. We hypothesize that the large catapult is caused by momentum "prolonging" the self-stabilization effect (Damian et al., 2023). We provide theoretical and empirical support for our hypothesis in a simple toy example and empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis for linear diagonal networks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Hacking Task Confounder in Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables rapid generalization to new tasks by learning knowledge from various tasks. It is intuitively assumed that as the training progresses, a model will acquire richer knowledge, leading to better generalization performance. However, our experiments reveal an unexpected result: there is negative knowledge transfer between tasks, affecting generalization performance. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for causal analysis. Our investigation uncovers the presence of spurious correlations between task-specific causal factors and labels in meta-learning. Furthermore, the confounding factors differ across different batches. We refer to these confounding factors as "Task Confounders". Based on these findings, we propose a plug-and-play Meta-learning Causal Representation Learner (MetaCRL) to eliminate task confounders. It encodes decoupled generating factors from multiple tasks and utilizes an invariant-based bi-level optimization mechanism to ensure their causality for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

Abstract: The performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers strongly depends on the properties of the target distribution such as its covariance structure, the location of its probability mass and its tail behavior. We explore the use of bijective affine transformations of the sample space to improve the properties of the target distribution and thereby the performance of samplers running in the transformed space. In particular, we propose a flexible and user-friendly scheme for adaptively learning the affine transformation during sampling. Moreover, the combination of our scheme with Gibbsian polar slice sampling is shown to produce samples of high quality at comparatively low computational cost in several settings based on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Position: Bayesian Deep Learning is Needed in the Age of Large-Scale AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current landscape of deep learning research, there is a predominant emphasis on achieving high predictive accuracy in supervised tasks involving large image and language datasets. However, a broader perspective reveals a multitude of overlooked metrics, tasks, and data types, such as uncertainty, active and continual learning, and scientific data, that demand attention. Bayesian deep learning (BDL) constitutes a promising avenue, offering advantages across these diverse settings. This paper posits that BDL can elevate the capabilities of deep learning. It revisits the strengths of BDL, acknowledges existing challenges, and highlights some exciting research avenues aimed at addressing these obstacles. Looking ahead, the discussion focuses on possible ways to combine large-scale foundation models with BDL to unlock their full potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance has gained increasing interest in the machine learning community in recent years, as it allows for the comparison of measures in different metric spaces. To overcome the limitations imposed by the equal mass requirements of the classical GW problem, researchers have begun exploring its application in unbalanced settings. However, Unbalanced GW (UGW) can only be regarded as a discrepancy rather than a rigorous metric/distance between two metric measure spaces (mm-spaces). In this paper, we propose a particular case of the UGW problem, termed Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW). We establish that PGW is a well-defined metric between mm-spaces and discuss its theoretical properties, including the existence of a minimizer for the PGW problem and the relationship between PGW and GW, among others. We then propose two variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the PGW problem and show that they are mathematically and computationally equivalent. Moreover, based on our PGW metric, we introduce the analogous concept of barycenters for mm-spaces. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our PGW metric and related solvers in applications such as shape matching, shape retrieval, and shape interpolation, comparing them against existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for studying meta-learning methods using PAC-Bayesian theory. Its main advantage over previous work is that it allows for more flexibility in how the transfer of knowledge between tasks is realized. For previous approaches, this could only happen indirectly, by means of learning prior distributions over models. In contrast, the new generalization bounds that we prove express the process of meta-learning much more directly as learning the learning algorithm that should be used for future tasks. The flexibility of our framework makes it suitable to analyze a wide range of meta-learning mechanisms and even design new mechanisms. Other than our theoretical contributions we also show empirically that our framework improves the prediction quality in practical meta-learning mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization has emerged as an attractive way to train robust machine learning models, capturing data uncertainty and distribution shifts. Recent statistical analyses have proved that robust models built from Wasserstein ambiguity sets have nice generalization guarantees, breaking the curse of dimensionality. However, these results are obtained in specific cases, at the cost of approximations, or under assumptions difficult to verify in practice. In contrast, we establish, in this article, exact generalization guarantees that cover all practical cases, including any transport cost function and any loss function, potentially non-convex and nonsmooth. For instance, our result applies to deep learning, without requiring restrictive assumptions. We achieve this result through a novel proof technique that combines nonsmooth analysis rationale with classical concentration results. Our approach is general enough to extend to the recent versions of Wasserstein/Sinkhorn distributionally robust problems that involve (double) regularizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a noise model for linear stochastic bandits for which the subgaussian noise parameter vanishes linearly as we select actions on the unit sphere closer and closer to the unknown vector. We introduce an algorithm for this problem that exhibits a minimax regret scaling as $\log^3(T)$ in the time horizon $T$, in stark contrast the square root scaling of this regret for typical bandit algorithms. Our strategy, based on weighted least-squares estimation, achieves the eigenvalue relation $\lambda_{\min} ( V_t ) = \Omega (\sqrt{\lambda_{\max}(V_t ) })$ for the design matrix $V_t$ at each time step $t$ through geometrical arguments that are independent of the noise model and might be of independent interest. This allows us to tightly control the expected regret in each time step to be of the order $O(\frac1{t})$, leading to the logarithmic scaling of the cumulative regret.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference from Slowly Varying Nonstationary Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference from observational data following the restricted structural causal models (SCM) framework hinges largely on the asymmetry between cause and effect from the data generating mechanisms, such as non-Gaussianity or non-linearity. This methodology can be adapted to stationary time series, yet inferring causal relationships from nonstationary time series remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a new class of restricted SCM, via a time-varying filter and stationary noise, and exploit the asymmetry from nonstationarity for causal identification in both bivariate and network settings. We propose efficient procedures by leveraging powerful estimates of the bivariate evolutionary spectra for slowly varying processes. Various synthetic and real datasets that involve high-order and non-smooth filters are evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Subgradient Convergence Implies Subdifferential Convergence on Weakly Convex Functions: With Uniform Rates Guarantees</title>

Abstract: In nonsmooth, nonconvex stochastic optimization, understanding the uniform convergence of subdifferential mappings is crucial for analyzing stationary points of sample average approximations of risk as they approach the population risk. Yet, characterizing this convergence remains a fundamental challenge.
  This work introduces a novel perspective by connecting the uniform convergence of subdifferential mappings to that of subgradient mappings as empirical risk converges to the population risk. We prove that, for stochastic weakly-convex objectives, and within any open set, a uniform bound on the convergence of subgradients -- chosen arbitrarily from the corresponding subdifferential sets -- translates to a uniform bound on the convergence of the subdifferential sets itself, measured by the Hausdorff metric.
  Using this technique, we derive uniform convergence rates for subdifferential sets of stochastic convex-composite objectives. Our results do not rely on key distributional assumptions in the literature, which require the population and finite sample subdifferentials to be continuous in the Hausdorff metric, yet still provide tight convergence rates. These guarantees lead to new insights into the nonsmooth landscapes of such objectives within finite samples.</description>

      <title>Bagging Improves Generalization Exponentially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bagging is a popular ensemble technique to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It hinges on the well-established rationale that, by repeatedly retraining on resampled data, the aggregated model exhibits lower variance and hence higher stability, especially for discontinuous base learners. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on bagging: By suitably aggregating the base learners at the parametrization instead of the output level, bagging improves generalization performances exponentially, a strength that is significantly more powerful than variance reduction. More precisely, we show that for general stochastic optimization problems that suffer from slowly (i.e., polynomially) decaying generalization errors, bagging can effectively reduce these errors to an exponential decay. Moreover, this power of bagging is agnostic to the solution schemes, including common empirical risk minimization, distributionally robust optimization, and various regularizations. We demonstrate how bagging can substantially improve generalization performances in a range of examples involving heavy-tailed data that suffer from intrinsically slow rates.</description>
