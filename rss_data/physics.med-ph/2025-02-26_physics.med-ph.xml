      <title>SynthRAD2025 Grand Challenge dataset: generating synthetic CTs for radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging is essential in modern radiotherapy, supporting diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Synthetic imaging, particularly synthetic computed tomography (sCT), is gaining traction in radiotherapy. The SynthRAD2025 dataset and Grand Challenge promote advancements in sCT generation by providing a benchmarking platform for algorithms using cone-beam CT (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
  The dataset includes 2362 cases: 890 MRI-CT and 1472 CBCT-CT pairs from head-and-neck, thoracic, and abdominal cancer patients treated at five European university medical centers (UMC Groningen, UMC Utrecht, Radboud UMC, LMU University Hospital Munich, and University Hospital of Cologne). Data were acquired with diverse scanners and protocols. Pre-processing, including rigid and deformable image registration, ensures high-quality, modality-aligned images. Extensive quality assurance validates image consistency and usability.
  All imaging data is provided in MetaImage (.mha) format, ensuring compatibility with medical image processing tools. Metadata, including acquisition parameters and registration details, is available in structured CSV files. To maintain dataset integrity, SynthRAD2025 is divided into training (65%), validation (10%), and test (25%) sets. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14918089 under the SynthRAD2025 collection.
  This dataset supports benchmarking and the development of synthetic imaging techniques for radiotherapy applications. Use cases include sCT generation for MRI-only and MR-guided photon/proton therapy, CBCT-based dose calculations, and adaptive radiotherapy workflows. By integrating diverse acquisition settings, SynthRAD2025 fosters robust, generalizable image synthesis algorithms, advancing personalized cancer care and adaptive radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Personalized Topology-Informed Localization of Standard 12-Lead ECG Electrode Placement from Incomplete Cardiac MRIs for Efficient Cardiac Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) offer personalized in-silico cardiac representations for the inference of multi-scale properties tied to cardiac mechanisms. The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the electrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on additional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for ECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient topology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG standard electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs. Specifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and then localize the standard electrodes of 12-lead ECG from the contours. Cardiac MRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete torso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we incorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be explicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional model projection-based method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: $1.24 \pm 0.293$ cm vs. $1.48 \pm 0.362$ cm) and efficiency ($2$~s vs. $30$-$35$~min). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detected electrodes for in-silico ECG simulation, highlighting their potential for creating accurate and efficient CDT models. The code is available at https://github.com/lileitech/12lead_ECG_electrode_localizer.</description>
