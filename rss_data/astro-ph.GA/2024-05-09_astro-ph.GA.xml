      <title>Torsion-rotational transitions in methanol as a probe of fundamental physical constants -- electron and proton masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the using of torsion-rotational transitions in the CH3OH and (13)CH3OH molecules to evaluate possible variations of the physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - from spectral observations of emission lines detected in the microwave range towards the dense molecular cloud Orion-KL. An estimate of the upper limit on the relative changes in mu is obtained by two independent ways - with (13)CH3OH lines and with the combination of (13)CH3OH and CH3OH lines. The calculated upper limit Delta mu/mu &lt; 1.1*10^{-8} (1 sigma) is in line with the most stringent constraints on the variability of fundamental physical constants established by other astrophysical methods.</description>

      <title>An optically-dark merging system at z~6 detected by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near- to mid-Infrared observations (from Spitzer and JWST) have revealed a hidden population of galaxies at redshift z=3-6, called optically-dark objects, which are believed to be massive and dusty star-formers. While optically-dark sources are widely recognized as a significant component of the stellar mass function, the history of their stellar mass assembly remains unexplored. However, they are thought to be the progenitors of the more massive early-type galaxies found in present-day groups and clusters. It is thus important to examine the possible connection between dark sources and merging events, in order to understand the environment in which they live. Here, we report our search for close companions in a sample of 19 optically-dark objects identified in the SMACS0723 JWST deep field. They were selected in the NIRCam F444W band and undetected below 2mu. We restrict our analysis to the reddest (i.e. F277W-F444W&gt; 1.3) and brightest (F444W&lt; 26 mag) objects. We have identified an optically-dark source showing a very close companion (&lt;0.5"). The spatially resolved SED fitting procedure indicates that all components lying within 1.5" from the dark source are indeed at z~5.7. Tidal features (leading to a whale shaped morphology) corroborate the hypothesis that the dark source is the most massive (log(M/Msun)&gt;10.3) and dusty (Av~3 at the core) system of an ongoing merger with a mass ratio of ~10. Similar merging systems are identified in the SERRA simulations, allowing us to reconstruct their stellar mass assembly history and predict their molecular gas properties The discovery of mergers within dark galaxies at the end of the Epoch of Reionization underscores the importance of conducting a statistical search for additional candidates in deep NIRCam fields. Such research will aid in understanding the role of merging processes during the obscured phase of stellar mass accumulation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic star formation and the abundance of $z&gt;10$ UV-bright galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a well-motivated galaxy formation framework to predict stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities of galaxy populations at redshifts $z\in 5-16$, taking into account stochasticity of SFR in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the model can match observational estimates of UV luminosity functions (LFs) at $5&lt;z&lt;10$ with a modest level of SFR stochasticity, resulting in the scatter of absolute UV luminosity at a given halo mass of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$. To match the observed UV LFs at $z\approx 11-13$ and $z\approx 16$ the SFR stochasticity should increase so that $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 1-1.3$ and $\approx 2$, respectively. Model galaxies at $z\approx 11-13$ have stellar masses and SFRs in good agreement with existing measurements. The median fraction of the baryon budget that was converted into stars, $f_\star$, is only $f_\star\approx 0.005-0.05$, but a small fraction of galaxies at $z=16$ have $f_\star&gt;1$ indicating that SFR stochasticity cannot be higher. We discuss several testable consequences of the increased SFR stochasticity at $z&gt;10$. The increase of SFR stochasticity with increasing $z$, for example, prevents steepening of UV LF and even results in some flattening of UV LF at $z\gtrsim 13$. The median stellar ages of model galaxies at $z\approx 11-16$ are predicted to decrease from $\approx 20-30$ Myr for $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -21$ galaxies to $\approx 5-10$ Myr for brighter ones. Likewise, the scatter in median stellar age is predicted to decrease with increasing luminosity. The scatter in the ratio of star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr should increase with redshift. Fluctuations of ionizing flux should increase at $z&gt;10$ resulting in the increasing scatter in the line fluxes and their ratios for the lines sensitive to ionization parameter.</description>

      <title>The GALAH survey: Tracing the Milky Way's formation and evolution through RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mergers and accretion events have been crucial in shaping the evolution of the Milky Way (MW). These events have been dynamically identified and chemically characterised using red giants and main-sequence stars. RR Lyrae (RRL) variables can play a crucial role in tracing the early formation of the MW since they are ubiquitous, old (t$\ge$10 Gyr) low-mass stars and accurate distance indicators. We exploited Data Release 3 of the GALAH survey to identify 78 field RRLs suitable for chemical analysis. Using synthetic spectra calculations, we determined atmospheric parameters and abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca, Y, and Ba. Most of our stars exhibit halo-like chemical compositions, with an iron peak around [Fe/H]$\approx -$1.40, and enhanced Ca and Mg content. Notably, we discovered a metal-rich tail, with [Fe/H] values ranging from $-$1 to approximately solar metallicity. This sub-group includes almost ~1/4 of the sample, it is characterised by thin disc kinematics and displays sub-solar $\alpha$-element abundances, marginally consistent with the majority of the MW stars. Surprisingly, they differ distinctly from typical MW disc stars in terms of the s-process elements Y and Ba. We took advantage of similar data available in the literature and built a total sample of 535 field RRLs for which we estimated kinematical and dynamical properties. We found that metal-rich RRLs (1/3 of the sample) likely represent an old component of the MW thin disc. We also detected RRLs with retrograde orbits and provided preliminary associations with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Helmi, Sequoia, Sagittarius, and Thamnos stellar streams.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on the ISM Conditions of a Low Mass, Highly Obscured z=4.27 Main Sequence Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the molecular gas content and ISM conditions of MACSJ0717 Az9, a strong gravitationally lensed $z=4.273$, $M_{*} \simeq 2\times10^9M_{\odot}$ star-forming galaxy with an unusually high ($\sim 80\%$) obscured star formation fraction. We detect CO(4-3) in two independent lensed images, as well as [N II]205$\mu$m, with ALMA. We derive a molecular gas mass of log$_{10}[M_{H_{2}} (M_{\odot})] = 9.77$ making it moderately deficient in molecular gas compared to the lower redshift gas fraction scaling relation. Leveraging photodissociation region (PDR) models, we combine our CO(4-3) measurements with existing measurements of the [C II] 158$\mu$m line and total infrared luminosity to model the PDR conditions. We find PDR conditions similar to local star-forming galaxies, with a mean hydrogen density log$_{10}$[$n_H$ $cm^{-3}$] = $4.80\pm0.39$ and a mean radiation field strength log$_{10}$[G$_0$ Habing] = $2.83\pm0.26$. Based on Band 3 continuum data, we derive an upper limit on the intrinsic dust mass of log$_{10}[M_{\rm dust} (M_{\odot})] &lt; 7.73$, consistent with existing estimates. We use the 3D tilted-ring model fitting code 3D-Barolo to determine the kinematic properties of the CO(4-3) emitting gas. We find that it is rotationally dominated, with a $V/\sigma=4.6 \pm 1.7$, consistent with the kinematics of the [C II]. With PDR conditions remarkably similar to normal dusty star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0.2 and a stable molecular disk, our observations of Az9 suggest that the dust-obscured phase for a low-mass galaxy at z$\sim$4 is relatively long. Thus, Az9 may be representative of a more widespread population that has been missed due to insufficiently deep existing millimeter surveys.</description>

      <title>Cue: A Fast and Flexible Photoionization Emulator for Modeling Nebular Emission Powered By Almost Any Ionizing Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex physics governing nebular emission in galaxies, particularly in the early universe, often defy simple low-dimensional models. This has proven to be a significant barrier in understanding the (often diverse) ionizing sources powering this emission. We present Cue, a highly flexible tool for interpreting nebular emission across a wide range of abundances and ionizing conditions of galaxies at different redshifts. Unlike typical nebular models used to interpret extragalactic nebular emission, our model does not require a specific ionizing spectrum as a source, instead approximating the ionizing spectrum with a 4-part piece-wise power-law. We train a neural net emulator based on the CLOUDY photoionization modeling code and make self-consistent nebular continuum and line emission predictions. Along with the flexible ionizing spectra, we allow freedom in [O/H], [N/O], [C/O], gas density, and total ionizing photon budget. This flexibility allows us to either marginalize over or directly measure the incident ionizing radiation, thereby directly interrogating the source of the ionizing photons in distant galaxies via their nebular emission. Our emulator demonstrates a high accuracy, with $\sim$1% uncertainty in predicting the nebular continuum and $\sim$5% uncertainty in the emission lines. Mock tests suggest Cue is well-calibrated and produces useful constraints on the ionizing spectra when $S/N (\mathrm{H}_\alpha) \gtrsim 10$, and furthermore capable of distinguishing between the ionizing spectra predicted by single and binary stellar models. The compute efficiency of neural networks facilitates future applications of Cue for rapid modeling of the nebular emission in large samples and Monte Carlo sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: I. A Point Process Formalism for Extraterrestrial Intelligences and Their Broadcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena. Unlike known astrophysical objects, the societies that generate them may be able to replicate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with abundance variations of many orders of magnitude. I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. The framework contains a hierarchy of objects related by a tree structure. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar "metasocieties." The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a "haystack." When a selection like an observation draws a sample, the point process is thinned. Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. I rederive the Drake Equation for societies in the limit of no expansion. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: II. Comparing Individualist and Collective Bounds on Broadcast Populations in Single Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy's observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than $\sim 10^6 (\overline{\ell}/10^{13} W)^{-1}$ L-band broadcasts per star gigahertz GHz in the Milky Way and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared--radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.</description>

      <title>Why do different early-type-galaxies have different amounts of rotational support?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type galaxies (ETGs, i.e. elliptical and lenticular galaxies) differ in their amount of rotational support -- some are purely supported by velocity dispersion, while others show pronounced ordered rotation. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that the progenitors of all ETGs were first rotating quickly, but then mergers decreased their rotational support. In the presented work, we studied this process using an observational archaeological approach. Namely, we inspected the correlations of 23 merger-sensitive characteristics of local ETGs with a parameter quantifying the rotational support. We used a volume-limited sample of local ETGs, that are not in galaxy clusters, from the MATLAS survey. We found, for example, that slowly rotating galaxies have tidal features and kinematically distinct components more often and have lower metallicities. We sought for mutual interpretation of the correlations among all 23 quantities, together with literature results on high-redshift massive galaxies. There seems to be only one interpretation possible: on average, ETGs lose their rotational support through multiple minor wet mergers happening at the redshifts above about two.</description>

      <title>First detection of CF$^{+}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CF$^{+}$ has been established as a valuable diagnostic tool for investigating photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) and fluorine abundances in the Milky Way. However, its role in extragalactic environments remains largely uncharted. Our objective is to explore the significance of CF$^{+}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and assess its utility as a valuable probe for examining C$^{+}$ and fluorine abundances in external galaxies. We performed pointed CF$^{+}$ observations toward an active star-forming region, N113 in the LMC, using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment 12~m sub-millimeter telescope. We report the first discovery of CF$^{+}$ in the LMC through the successful detection of the CF$^{+}$ (2$\to$1) and (3$\to$2) lines. The excitation models indicate that CF$^{+}$ emission originates from dense PDRs characterized by an H$_{2}$ number density of $(0.5-7.9)\times 10^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$ in N113. Our observations provide the first constraint on the fluorine abundance in molecular clouds in the LMC, disclosing a value of $\lesssim 1.7\times 10^{-9}$. This value is about an order of magnitude lower than those previously measured toward red giants in the LMC, indicative of fluorine deficiency in the molecular gas. The estimated column density ratio between C$^{+}$ and CF$^{+}$ appears to be lower than the anticipated equilibrium ratio derived from the fluorine abundance in red giants. Both phenomena can be explained by the deficiency of CF$^{+}$ caused by the freeze-out of its primary chemical precursor, HF, onto dust grains. The deficiency of CF$^{+}$ within molecular clouds suggests that the measurements presented in this work serve exclusively as conservative estimates, establishing lower bounds for both the fluorine abundance and C$^{+}$ column densities in external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Time Delay Anomalies of Fuzzy Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter is a promising alternative to the standard cold dark matter. It has quite recently been noticed, that they can not only successfully explain the large-scale structure in the Universe, but can also solve problems of position and flux anomalies in galaxy strong lensing systems. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of time delays in strong lensing systems caused by fuzzy dark matter, thus making an important extension of previous works. We select a specific system HS 0810+2554 for the study of time delay anomalies. Then, based on the nature of the fuzzy dark matter fluctuations, we obtain theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the perturbation caused by fuzzy dark matter, its content in the galaxy, and its de Broglie wavelength $\lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}$. It turns out that, the perturbation of strong lensing time delays due to fuzzy dark matter quantified as standard deviation is $\sigma_{\Delta t} \propto \lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}^{1.5}$. We also verify our results through simulations. Relatively strong fuzzy dark matter fluctuations in a lensing galaxy make it possible to to destroy the topological structure of the lens system and change the arrival order between the saddle point and the minimum point in the time delays surface. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity for studying properties of fuzzy dark matter created by possible precise time delay measurements from strongly lensed transients like fast radio bursts, supernovae or gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Does Metallicity affect Protoplanetary Disk Fraction? Answers from the Outer Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9-2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34-0.83 Z$_{\odot}$) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using $JHK$ data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2-2 M$_{\odot}$) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25-0.85 Z$_{\odot}$ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low-metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average $2.6\pm0.2$ times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in sub-solar metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3-1.4 and 1.4-2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.</description>

      <title>MOSEL survey: Unwrapping the Epoch of Reionization through mimic galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the first galaxies that reionized the universe during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) remains unclear. Attempts to directly determine spectral properties of these early galaxies are affected by both limited photometric constraints across the spectrum and by the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) to the Lyman Continuum (LyC) at high redshift. We approach this by analysing properties of analogous extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs, [OIII]+Hbeta EW $&gt;400$ Angstrom) at $2.5&lt;z&lt;4$ from the ZFOURGE survey using the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties (MAGPHYS) SED fitting code. We compare these to galaxies at $z&gt;5.5$ observed with the James Webb Space Telesope (JWST) with self-consistent spectral energy distribution fitting methodology. This work focuses on the comparison of their UV slopes ($\beta_P$), ionizing photon production efficiencies $\xi_{ion}$, star formation rates and dust properties to determine the effectiveness of this analogue selection technique. We report the median ionizing photon production efficiencies as log$_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\ {\rm erg}^{-1}))=$$25.14^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$,$25.16^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$,$25.16^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$,$25.18^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ for our ZFOURGE control, ZFOURGE EELG, JADES and CEERS samples respectively. ZFOURGE EELGs are 0.57 dex lower in stellar mass and have half the dust extinction, compared to their ZFOURGE control counterparts. They also have a similar specific star formation rates and $\beta_P$ to the $z&gt;5.5$ samples. We find that EELGs at low redshift ($2.5&lt;z&lt;4$) are analogous to EoR galaxies in their dust attenuation and specific star formation rates. Their extensive photometric coverage and the accessibility of their LyC region opens pathways to infer stellar population properties in the EoR.</description>

      <title>The dynamical age of the LMC globular cluster NGC 1835 using the "dynamical clock"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the study of the size-age relationship observed in star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the investigation of its origin, here we present the determination of the structural parameters and the dynamical age of the massive cluster NGC 1835. We have used a powerful combination of optical and near-ultraviolet images acquired with the WFC3 onboard the HST to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, determining the values of the core, half-mass and tidal radii through the comparison with the King model family. The same data also allowed us to evaluate the dynamical age of the cluster by using the 'dynamical clock'. This is an empirical method that quantifies the level of central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster half-mass radius by means of the A+ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. The results confirm that NGC 1835 is a very compact cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The estimated value of A+ ($0.30\pm 0.04$) is the largest measured so far in the LMC clusters, providing evidence of a highly dynamically evolved stellar system. NGC 1835 nicely fits into the correlation between A+ and the central relaxation time and in the anti-correlation between A+ and the core radius defined by the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud clusters investigated to date.</description>

      <title>The many colors of the TNG100 simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the 3D dust radiative transfer code SKIRT to the low-redshift ($z\leq0.1$) galaxy population in the TNG100 cosmological simulation, the fiducial run of the IllustrisTNG project. We compute global fluxes and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter for $\approx\,$60 000 galaxies. Our post-processing methodology follows the study of Tr\v{c}ka et al. (2022) of the higher-resolution TNG50 simulation. We verify that TNG100 reproduces observational luminosity functions at low redshifts to excellent precision, unlike TNG50. Additionally, we test the realism of our TNG100 plus SKIRT fluxes by comparing various flux and color relations to data from the GAMA survey. TNG100 broadly reproduces the observed distributions, but we predict ultraviolet colors that are too blue by $\approx\,$0.4 mag, possibly related to the extinction in the star-forming regions subgrid model not being selective enough. Furthermore, we find that the simulated galaxies exhibit mid-infrared fluxes elevated by up to $\approx\,$0.5 mag that we attribute to overly effective stochastic heating of the diffuse dust. All synthetic broadband fluxes and SEDs are made publicly available in three orientations and four apertures, and can readily be used to study TNG100 galaxies in a mock observational fashion.</description>

      <title>High-mass star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud triggered by colliding HI flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galactic tidal interaction is a possible mechanism to trigger the active star formation in galaxies. The recent analyses using the HI data in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) proposed that the tidally driven HI flow, the L-component, is colliding with the LMC disk, the D-component, and is triggering high-mass star formation toward the active star-forming regions R136 and N44. In order to explore the role of the collision over the entire LMC disk, we investigated the I-component, the collision-compressed gas between the L- and D-components, over the LMC disk, and found that 74% of the O/WR stars are located toward the I-component, suggesting their formation in the colliding gas. We compared four star-forming regions (R136, N44, N11, N77-N79-N83 complex). We found a positive correlation between the number of high-mass stars and the compressed gas pressure generated by collisions, suggesting that the pressure may be a key parameter in star formation.</description>

      <title>More than 200 Globular Clusters in the Milky Way, and still no super-Solar metallicity ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge. Our main goal is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the MWGC system that we know today. We catalogue 37 recently discovered GCs. We use different distributions for investigating the MWGC system: metallicity distribution (MD), luminosity function (LF), and age distribution. We first treat separately the new GCs sample from the known and well-characterised GCs. We merge these two samples, upgrading the MWGC system. We performed a comparison between our clusters sample and field star (FS) population. We find a double peaked distribution for the LF, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the "merged" sample, the LF and the MDs display a bimodality trend. We construct the MD for the FS sample, and comparing this with that one of the GCs, we learn that a high percentage of FS show [Fe/H]$&gt;0$, whereas we do not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. In order to understand this inconsistency, we construct the age-metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age$\geq8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$\leq -1.0$) is represented by GCs, while the young and metal-rich population (age$&lt;8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$&gt;-1.0$) corresponds to FS. From the analysis of the GC LF and MD, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes, typical of the Bulge regions. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the GC and FS samples should be sought in the evolutionary difference between these two stellar populations.</description>

      <title>What role of gravity, turbulence and magnetic fields in high-mass star formation clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the potential role of gravity, turbulence and magnetic fields in high-mass star formation in molecular clouds, this study revisits the velocity dispersion--size ($\sigma$--$L$) and density--size ($\rho$--$L$) scalings and the associated turbulent energy spectrum using an extensive data sample. The sample includes various hierarchical density structures in high-mass star formation clouds, across scales of 0.01 to 100 pc. We observe $\sigma \propto L^{0.26}$ and $\rho \propto L^{-1.54}$ scalings, converging toward a virial equilibrium state. A nearly flat virial parameter--mass ($\alpha_{\rm vir}-M$) distribution is seen across all density scales, with $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ values centered around unity, suggesting a global equilibrium maintained by the interplay between gravity and turbulence across multiple scales. Our turbulent energy spectrum ($E(k)$) analysis, based on the $\sigma$--$L$ and $\rho$--$L$ scalings, yields a characteristic $E(k) \propto k^{-1.52}$. These findings indicate the potential significance of gravity, turbulence, and possibly magnetic fields all in regulating dynamics of molecular clouds and high-mass star formation therein.</description>

      <title>Implication of the velocity dispersion scalings on high-mass star formation in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is aimed at exploring implications of velocity dispersion scalings on high-mass star formation in molecular clouds, including the scalings of Larson's linewidth--size ($\sigma$--$R$) and ratio--mass surface density ($\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$; here $\cal{L}$$=\sigma/R^{0.5}$). We have systematically analyzed the $\sigma$ parameter of well-selected 221 massive clumps, complemented with published samples of other hierarchical density structures of molecular clouds over spatial scales of 0.01--10 pc. Those massive clumps are classified into four phases: quiescent, protostellar, HII region, and PDR clumps in an evolutionary sequence. The velocity dispersion of clumps increases overall with the evolutionary sequence, reflecting enhanced stellar feedback in more evolved phases. The relations of $\sigma$--$R$ and $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ are weak with the clump sample alone, but become evident when combined with others spanning a much wider spatial scales. For $\sigma$--$R$, its tight relation indicates a kinematic connection between hierarchical density structures, supporting theoretical models of multiscale high-mass star formation. From the $\cal{L}$--$\Sigma$ relation, cloud structures can be found to transition from over-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} &gt; 2$) to sub-virial state ($\alpha_\mathrm{vir} &lt; 2$) as they become smaller and denser, indicating a possible shift in the governing force from turbulence to gravity. This implies that the multiscale physical process of high-mass star formation hinges on the self-gravity of sub-virial molecular clouds. However, the influence of turbulence may not be dismissed until large-scale clouds attain a sub-virial state. This is pending confirmation from future multiscale kinematic observations of molecular clouds with uniform observing settings.</description>

      <title>JWST FRESCO: a comprehensive census of H$\beta$+[OIII] emitters at 6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0 in the GOODS fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the census of H$\beta$+[O III] $4960,5008$ \AA emitters at $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ with observed [O III] fluxes $f_{[O III]}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{erg}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}$. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7$) and a high ionisation parameter $\log_{10}U \simeq -2.5$ at a median UV magnitude $M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}$. We find a factor $\times\ 1.3$ difference in the number density of $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by single overdensity at $7.0&lt;z&lt;7.2$ in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [O III] emitters is in good agreement with that from pre-JWST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [O III] LF, [O III] /UV ratio and [O III] equivalent widths distribution and that predicted by theoretical models suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in $z&gt;7$ galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [O III] luminosity density at $z\gtrsim 6-7$ which cannot be explained solely by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally, we find that FRESCO, in only $2$h, captures star-forming galaxies likely accounting for $\sim 10-20\%$ of the ionising budget at $z=7$ and $z=8$, raising the prospect of detecting directly all the sources of reionisation with JWST.</description>

      <title>Likelihood and appearance of life beyond the Earth: An astronomical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of 2023, over 5500 planets are known to orbit stars other than our Sun. We can measure their sizes and orbital periods, infer their masses and temperatures, and constrain their compositions. Based on these data, about 1% of extrasolar planets are potentially habitable for life as we know it, implying that of the billions of planets in our Galaxy, some may actually be inhabited, at least by microbes. However, recognizing signs of alien life forms is a major challenge for current technology, because of the wide range of conditions on extrasolar planets, and because of the wide range of forms that life may take. This chapter reviews observations of exoplanets and discusses astrobiological definitions of habitability and the likelihood of finding life beyond the Earth, both within and outside the Solar system.</description>

      <title>The role of AGN winds in galaxy formation: connecting AGN outflows at low redshifts to the formation/evolution of their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using SDSS spectra, we applied an automatic method to search for outflows (OFs) in three large samples of narrow-line AGN at low redshifts (z &lt; 0.4), separated in three spectral activity classes: radio-loud RG, 15,793, radio-quiet, Sy2, 18,585, and LINER, 25,656. In general, the probability of detecting an OF decreases along the sequence Sy1-&gt;Sy2-&gt;LINER/RG and, independently of the AGN class, the wind velocity, traced by W80, increases with the AGN luminosity. Moreover W80 is systematically higher in RG or any of the other AGN class when detected in radio. These results support the idea that there are two main modes of production of OF, the radiative mode dominant in radio-quiet AGN and the jet mode dominant in radio-loud galaxies, although both modes could also happen simultaneously at different levels. From the spectra and SDSS photometry, the characteristics of the AGN host galaxies and their super-massive black holes (SMBHs) were also retrieved using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. This revealed that, independently of their spectral class, 1) galaxy hosts with OFs have systematically later morphological types and higher star formation rates than their counterpart without OF, 2) they occupy different positions in the specific diagnostic diagram, sSMBH vs. sSFR, which suggests they follow different evolutionary paths congruent with the morphology of their galaxy hosts, and 3) they show no evidence of AGN quenching or triggering of star formation. These results are consistent with a scenario explaining the different AGN classes as consequences of different formation processes of galaxies: early-type galaxies (LINER and RG) formed bigger bulges and more massive SMBHs, exhausting their reservoir of gas more rapidly than late-type galaxies (Sy2 and Sy1), quenching their star formation and starving their SMBHs.</description>

      <title>The KALEIDOSCOPE survey : A new strong and weak gravitational lensing view of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a combined strong and weak gravitational-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z=0.545$, MACS J1423 hereafter), one of the most dynamically relaxed and massive cool-core clusters discovered in the MAssive Cluster Survey at $z&gt;0.5$. We combine high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the F606W, F814W, and F160W pass-bands with spectroscopic observations taken as part of the KALEIDOSCOPE survey with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer mounted on the Very Large Telescope. Our strong lensing analysis of the mass distribution in the cluster core is constrained by four multiple-image systems (17 individual images) within redshift range $1.779&lt;z&lt;2.840$. Our weak-lensing analysis of the cluster outskirts, confined to the HST field of view, is based on a background galaxy catalogue with a density of 57 gal.arcmin$^{-2}$. We measure a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;200$ kpc) = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ from our strong-lensing model, and a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;640$ kpc) = (6.6 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ when combining with our the weak-lensing constraints. Our analysis of the cluster mass distribution yields no evidence of substructures, confirming the dynamically relaxed state of MACS J1423. Our work sets the stage for future analysis of MACS J1423 in the upcoming Canadian Near Infrared Imager and Stiltless Spectrograph Unbiased Cluster Survey for the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Starspots and Undetected Binary Stars Have Distinct Signatures in Young Stellar Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red-optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a high angular resolution (1.1") and sensitivity (maximum of ~0.1 mJy) radio survey at 1-2 GHz in the Galactic Bulge. This complements the X-ray Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey, and investigates the full radio source population in this dense Galactic region. Radio counterparts to sources at other wavelengths can aid in classification, as there are relatively few types of objects that are reasonably detectable in radio at kiloparsec distances, and even fewer that are detected in both X-rays and radio. This survey covers about 3 square degrees of the Galactic Bulge Survey area (spanning the Galactic coordinate range of -3deg &lt; l &lt; +3deg and +1.6deg &lt; b &lt; +2.1deg as a first look into this region of the Galaxy with this combination of frequency, resolution, and sensitivity. Spectral indices within the observed band of 1-2 GHz were calculated for each source to assist in determining its emission mechanism. We find 1617 unique sources in the survey, 25 of which are radio counterparts to X-ray sources, and about 100 of which are steep-spectrum (alpha &lt;~ -1.4) point sources that are viable pulsar candidates. Four radio sources are of particular interest: a compact binary; an infrared transient with an inverted radio spectrum; a potential transitional millisecond pulsar candidate; and a very steep spectrum radio source with an X-ray and bright infrared counterpart. We discuss other notable sources, including possible radio transients, potential new planetary nebulae, and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Catalog of early-type Runaway stars from LAMOST-DR8</title>

Abstract: Runaway stars are OB-type stars ejected from their birthplace with large peculiar velocities. The leading hypothesis addressed in their formation includes the supernova ejection mechanism and the dynamic ejection scenario. Identification of runaway populations is the first step to investigating their formation and evolution. Here we present our work of searching for Galactic runaway candidate stars from the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR8 database. After studying the kinematic properties for a collection of 4,432 early-type stars, predominantly B-type stars, using the radial velocity measurements from LAMOST DR8 and astrometric solutions made by Gaia DR3, we identified 229 runaway candidate stars. They span a wide distribution in projected rotational velocities. We investigated the Galactic spatial distribution of the runaway population and noticed that most of them likely reside within the Galactic thin disk. Based upon analyzing the Doppler shifts of the candidate stars, we found two binary runaway candidates displaying velocity variation with estimated orbital periods of 40 and 61 days.</description>

      <title>Cepheids as distance indicators and stellar tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the phenomenology of classical Cepheids (CCs), Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) and type II Cepheids (TIICs) in the Milky Way (MW) and in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs).
  We also examine the Hertzsprung progression in different stellar systems by using the shape of I-band light curves (Fourier parameters) and observables based on the difference in magnitude and in phase between the bump and the minimum in luminosity.
  The distribution of Cepheids in optical and in optical-near infrared (NIR) color--magnitude diagrams is investigated to constrain the topology of the instability strip. The use of Cepheids as tracers of young (CCs), intermediate (ACs) and old (TIICs) stellar populations are brought forward by the comparison between observations (MCs) and cluster isochrones covering a broad range in stellar ages and in chemical compositions.
  The different diagnostics adopted to estimate individual distances (period--luminosity, period--Wesenheit, period--luminosity--color relations) are reviewed together with pros and cons in the use of fundamental and overtones, optical and NIR photometric bands, and reddening free pseudo magnitudes (Wesenheit). We also discuss the use of CCs as stellar tracers and the radial gradients among the different groups of elements (iron, alpha, neutron-capture) together with their age-dependence.
  Finally, we briefly outline the role that near-future space and ground-based facilities will play in the astrophysical and cosmological use of Cepheids.</description>

      <title>A Gamma-ray Emitting Collisional Ring Galaxy System in our Galactic Neighborhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons carry the signatures of the violent phenomena happening on various astronomical scales in our Universe. This includes supernova remnants, pulsars, and pulsar wind nebulae in the Galactic environment and extragalactic relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, $\sim$30\% of the \gm-ray sources detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope lack multiwavelength counterpart association, precluding us from characterizing their origin. Here we report, for the first time, the association of a collisional ring galaxy system in our Galactic neighborhood (distance $\sim$10 Mpc), formed as a consequence of a smaller `bullet' galaxy piercing through a larger galaxy, as the multi-frequency counterpart of an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724. The system, also known as "Kathryn's Wheel", contains two dwarf irregular galaxies and an edge-on, late-type, spiral galaxy surrounded by a ring of star-forming knots. We utilized observations taken from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Visible MultiObject Spectrograph at Very Large Telescope to ascertain the association with 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724 and to explore the connection between the star-forming activities and the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. We found that star-formation alone cannot explain the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, and additional contribution likely from the pulsars/supernova remnants or buried AGN is required. We conclude that arcsecond/sub-arcsecond-scale observations of this extraordinary $\gamma$-ray emitting galaxy collision will be needed to resolve the environment and explore the origin of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Galaxy Outflows at $z\sim 6-9$ with Imaging and Spectroscopic Signatures Identified with JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present statistics of $z\sim 6-9$ galaxy outflows indicated by spatially-extended gas emission and broad lines. With a total of 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$ in the JWST CEERS, GLASS, and ERO data, we find four galaxies with [O{\sc iii}]+H$\beta$ ionized gas emission significantly extended beyond the kpc-scale stellar components on the basis of the emission line images constructed by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband (line on/off-band) images. By comparison with low-$z$ galaxies, the fraction of galaxies with the spatially extended gas, 4/18, at $z\sim 6-9$ is an order of magnitude higher than those at $z\sim 0-1$, which can be explained by events triggered by frequent major mergers at high redshift. We also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at $z\sim 6-9$, and identify five galaxies with broad ($140-800$ km s$^{-1}$) lines in the [O{\sc iii}] forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows. One galaxy at $z=6.38$ shows both the spatially-extended gas emission and the broad lines, while none of the galaxies with the spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines present a clear signature of AGN either in the line diagnostics or Type 1 AGN line broadening ($&gt;1000$ km s$^{-1}$), which hint outflows mainly driven by stellar feedback. The existence of galaxies with/without spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines may be explained by different viewing angles towards outflows, or that these are galaxies in the early, late, post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift, where the relatively large fractions of such galaxies indicate the longer-duration and/or more-frequent outflows at the early cosmic epoch.</description>

      <title>HI discs of L$_{\ast}$ galaxies as probes of the baryonic physics of galaxy evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding what shapes the cold gas component of galaxies, which both provides the fuel for star formation and is strongly affected by the subsequent stellar feedback, is a crucial step towards a better understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we analyse the HI properties of a sample of 46 Milky Way halo-mass galaxies, drawn from cosmological simulations (EMP-Pathfinder and FIREbox). This set of simulations comprises galaxies evolved self-consistently across cosmic time with different baryonic sub-grid physics: three different star formation models [constant star formation efficiency (SFE) with different star formation eligibility criteria, and an environmentally-dependent, turbulence-based SFE] and two different feedback prescriptions, where only one sub-sample includes early stellar feedback. We use these simulations to assess the impact of different baryonic physics on the HI content of galaxies. We find that the galaxy-wide HI properties agree with each other and with observations. However, differences appear for small-scale properties. The thin HI discs observed in the local Universe are only reproduced with a turbulence-dependent SFE and/or early stellar feedback. Furthermore, we find that the morphology of HI discs is particularly sensitive to the different physics models: galaxies simulated with a turbulence-based SFE have discs that are smoother and more rotationally symmetric, compared to those simulated with a constant SFE; galaxies simulated with early stellar feedback have more regular discs than supernova-feedback-only galaxies. We find that the rotational asymmetry of the HI discs depends most strongly on the underlying physics model, making this a promising observable for understanding the physics responsible for shaping the interstellar medium of galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Debris of the "Last Major Merger" is Dynamically Young</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way's (MW) inner stellar halo contains an [Fe/H]-rich component with highly eccentric orbits, often referred to as the "last major merger." Hypotheses for the origin of this component include Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), where the progenitor collided with the MW proto-disk 8-11 Gyr ago, and the Virgo Radial Merger (VRM), where the progenitor collided with the MW disk within the last 3 Gyr. These two scenarios make different predictions about observable structure in local phase space, because the morphology of debris depends on how long it has had to phase mix. The recently-identified phase-space folds in Gaia DR3 have positive caustic velocities, making them fundamentally different than the phase-mixed chevrons found in simulations at late times. Roughly 20\% of the stars in the prograde local stellar halo are associated with the observed caustics. Based on a simple phase-mixing model, the observed number of caustics are consistent with a merger that occurred 1--2 Gyr ago. We also compare the observed phase-space distribution to FIRE-2 Latte simulations of GSE-like mergers, using a quantitative measurement of phase mixing (2D causticality). The observed local phase-space distribution best matches the simulated data 1--2 Gyr after collision, and certainly not later than 3 Gyr. This is further evidence that the progenitor of the "last major merger" did not collide with the MW proto-disk at early times, as is thought for the GSE, but instead collided with the MW disk within the last few Gyr, consistent with the body of work surrounding the VRM.</description>

      <title>Effects of multi-channel AGN feedback in FIRE cosmological simulations of massive galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback from supermassive black holes is believed to be a critical driver of the observed color bimodality of galaxies above the Milky Way mass scale. AGN feedback has been modeled in many galaxy formation simulations, but most implementations have involved simplified prescriptions or a coarse-grained interstellar medium (ISM). We present the first set of FIRE-3 cosmological zoom-in simulations with AGN feedback evolved to $z\sim0$, examining the impact of AGN feedback on a set of galaxies with halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{13} M_{\odot}$. These simulations combine detailed stellar and ISM physics with multi-channel AGN feedback including radiative feedback, mechanical outflows, and in some simulations, cosmic rays (CRs). We find that massive (&gt;L*) galaxies in these simulations can match local scaling relations including the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ relation; in the stronger model with CRs, they also match the size-mass relation and the Faber-Jackson relation. Many of the massive galaxies in the simulations with AGN feedback have quenched star formation and elliptical morphologies, in qualitative agreement with observations. In contrast, simulations at the massive end without AGN feedback produce galaxies that are too massive and form stars too rapidly, are order-of-magnitude too compact, and have velocity dispersions well above Faber-Jackson. Despite these successes, the AGN models analyzed do not produce uniformly realistic galaxies when the feedback parameters are held constant: while the stronger model produces the most realistic massive galaxies, it tends to over-quench the lower-mass galaxies. This indicates that further refinements of the AGN modeling are needed.</description>

      <title>The CAVITY project. The spatially resolved stellar population properties of galaxies in voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Universe is shaped as a web-like structure, formed by clusters, filaments, and walls that leave large volumes in between named voids. Galaxies in voids have been found to be of a later type, bluer, less massive, and to have a slower evolution than galaxies in denser environments (filaments and walls). However, the effect of the void environment on their stellar population properties is still unclear. We aim to address this question using 118 optical integral field unit datacubes from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY), observed with the PMAS/PPaK spectrograph at the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almer\'ia, Spain). We used the non-parametric full spectral fitting code STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar population properties: stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, age, star formation rate (SFR), and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We analysed the results through the global and spatially resolved properties. Then, we compared them with a control sample of galaxies in filaments and walls from the CALIFA survey, matched in stellar mass and morphological type. Key findings include void galaxies having a slightly higher half-light radius (HLR), lower stellar mass surface density, and younger ages across all morphological types, and slightly elevated SFR and sSFR (only significant enough for Sas). Many of these differences appear in the outer parts of spiral galaxies in voids (HLR &gt; 1), which are younger and exhibit a higher sSFR, indicative of less evolved discs. This trend is also found for early-type spirals, suggesting a slower transition from star-forming to quiescent states in voids. Our analysis indicates that void galaxies, influenced by their surroundings, undergo a more gradual evolution, especially in their outer regions, with a more pronounced effect for low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>What drives the corpulence of galaxies? I. The formation of central compact dwarf galaxies in TNG50</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearby dwarf galaxies display a variety of effective radii (sizes) at a given stellar mass, suggesting different evolution scenarios according to their final "stellar" size. The TNG hydrodynamical simulations present a bimodality in the z = 0 size - mass relation (SMRz0) of dwarf galaxies, at $r_{1/2,\star}$ ~ 450 pc. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explored the evolution of the most massive progenitors of dwarf galaxies (z=0 $\log( M_\star / \mathrm{M}_\odot)$ between 8.4 and 9.2) that end up as central galaxies of their groups. We split these dwarfs into three classes of the SMRz0: "Normals" from the central spine of the main branch, and "Compacts" from the secondary branch as well as the lower envelope of the main branch. Both classes of Compacts see their stellar sizes decrease from z ~ 1 onwards in contrast to Normals, while the sizes of the gas and dark matter (DM) components continue to increase (as for Normals). A detailed analysis reveals that Compacts live in poorer environments, and thus suffer fewer major mergers from z = 0.8 onwards, which otherwise would pump angular momentum into the gas, allowing strong gas inflows, producing inner star formation, and thus leading to the buildup of a stellar core. Compacts are predicted to be rounder and to have bluer cores. Compact dwarfs of similar sizes are observed in the GAMA survey, but the bimodality in size is less evident and the most compact dwarfs tend to be passive rather than star forming, as in TNG50. Our conclusions should therefore be confirmed with future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of a Major Merger in the Perseus Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the Perseus cluster has often been regarded as an archetypical relaxed galaxy cluster, several lines of evidence including ancient, large-scale cold fronts, asymmetric plasma morphology, filamentary galaxy distribution, etc., provide a conflicting view of its dynamical state, suggesting that the cluster might have experienced a major merger. However, the absence of a clear merging companion identified to date hampers our understanding of the evolutionary track of the Perseus cluster consistent with these observational features. In this paper, through careful weak lensing analysis, we successfully identified the missing subcluster halo ($M_{200}=1.70^{+0.73}_{-0.59}\times10^{14}~M_{\odot}$) at the &gt;5$\sigma$ level centered on NGC1264, which is located ~430 kpc west of the Perseus main cluster core. Moreover, a significant ($&gt;3\sigma$) mass bridge, which is also traced by the cluster member galaxies, is detected between the Perseus main and sub clusters, which serves as direct evidence of gravitational interaction. With idealized numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a ~3:1 off-axis major merger can create the cold front observed ~700 kpc east of the main cluster core and also generate the observed mass bridge through multiple core crossings.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating razor-thin disks around black holes via multi-hole seeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct self-gravitating razor-thin disks of counterrotating dust around Schwarzschild black holes (BHs) by applying the "displace, cut, and reflect" method to known seed solutions representing multi-holes. All but one of the sources of the seed solution generate the surrounding annular disk, whereas the remaining BH is kept unaltered and lies at the disk center after the transformation. The disks are infinite in extent, have annular character, and are linearly stable up to the innermost stable circular orbit of the system. Moreover, all energy conditions are satisfied along the disk and the spacetime is asymptotically flat, having finite ADM mass. We also comment on charged disks around extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs constructed from a Majumdar-Papapetrou $N$-BH seed solution. These simple examples can be extended to more general "BH + disk" solutions, obtained by the same method from seeds of the type "BH + arbitrary axisymmetric source". A natural follow-up of this work would be to construct disks around Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs with arbitrary charge-to-mass ratio and around Kerr BHs.</description>
