      <title>Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for non-covalent interactions within the S66 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than $7.5\,$kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we pinpoint systems in the S66 dataset where these discrepancies are particularly prominent, offering cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.</description>

      <title>Fully analytic G$_0$W$_0$ nuclear gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the first fully analytic derivation and implementation of nuclear gradients for the G$_0$W$_0$ method. For this, we leverage the recently established connection between the G$_0$W$_0$ approach and equation-of-motion unitary coupled-cluster theory for charged excitations [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 124123 (2023)]. Analytic gradients are obtained through the Lagrangian technique and are implemented and validated by comparison with finite-difference calculations. For G$_0$W$_0$, we examine the effect of the Tamm--Dancoff approximation for evaluating the screened Coulomb interaction. Finally, we compare G$_0$W$_0$ adiabatic ionization potential and electron affinities to wavefunction-based electronic structure methods, and experimental values.</description>

      <title>GW plus cumulant approach for predicting core-level shake-up satellites in large molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the $GW$ approach has emerged as a valuable tool for computing deep core-level binding energies as measured in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. However, $GW$ fails to accurately predict shake-up satellite features, which arise from charge-neutral excitations accompanying the ionization. In this work, we extend the $GW$ plus cumulant ($GW+C$) approach to molecular 1s excitations, deriving conditions under which $GW+C$ can be reliably applied to shake-up processes. We present an efficient implementation with $O(N^4)$ scaling with respect to the system size $N$, within an all-electron framework based on numeric atom-centered orbitals. We demonstrate that decoupling the core and valence spaces is crucial when using localized basis functions. Additionally, we meticulously validate the basis set convergence of the satellite spectrum for 65 spectral functions and identify the importance of diffuse augmenting functions. To assess the accuracy, we apply our $GW+C$ scheme to $\pi$-conjugated molecules containing up to 40 atoms, predicting dominant satellite features within 0.5~eV of experimental values. For the acene series, from benzene to pentacene, we demonstrate how $GW+C$ provides critical insights into the interpretation of experimentally observed satellite features.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

      <title>An accurate and efficient framework for predictive insights into ionic surface chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to ionic surfaces with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve long-standing debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering valuable benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is completely open-source, making it possible to now routinely apply cWFT to complex problems in ionic surface chemistry.</description>

      <title>Emerging non-local quantum phenomena in a classical system of organo-metallic microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work investigates enantiomers of chiral organo-metallic particles that exhibit a collective memory effect. Under the influence of magnetic field millions of particles in solution form macroscopic shapes and when dispersed again at zero field they return to their original shape. The charge and magnetic behaviors of the particles are strongly dependent on the handedness of the chiral molecule in the hybrid organometallic compound. The microparticles forming the shaped structures are collectively coupled under the influence of long-range van der Waals exchange interactions which govern the collective macroscopic structure. There is striking evidence that the nonlocal quantum exchange interactions between particles persist up to a distance of 10 meters at temperatures above 00C. The forces which govern the collective memory effect and shape the macroscopic structure therefore allow to visualize quantum phenomena which extend the classical causality notion into an expanded nonlocal reality in which the quantum fields of the particles exist simultaneously at separated points in space. We propose that the observations are attributed to chiral electronic states dependent van der Waals interactions coupled to vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Natural Orbital Non-Orthogonal Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is a generalization of the standard orthogonal configuration interaction (CI) method and offers a highly flexible framework for describing ground and excited electronic states. However, this flexibility also comes with challenges, as there is still no clear or generally accepted approach for constructing a compact and accurate state basis for NOCI. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a novel NOCI approach designed with three primary objectives: (1) ensuring the method is systematic, (2) achieving a compact NOCI expansion, and (3) treating all electronic states of interest on equal footing. The development of our approach is presented step by step, with each building block evaluated and validated through applications to simple model systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal symmetry in action-detected optical spectroscopy: highlighting excited-state dynamics in large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through the time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we demonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic field-cycling instrument for optical NMR hyperpolarization studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offers an attractive approach to enhancing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Efficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to operate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it particularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or spatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical DNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron and nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature. This necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental conditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument that facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields (10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment enables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the ability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse sequences involving millions of RF pulses. We describe innovations in the device design and demonstrate its operation on a model system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond polarized through optically pumped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We anticipate the use of the instrument for a broad range of optical DNP systems and studies.</description>

      <title>MOL-Mamba: Enhancing Molecular Representation with Structural &amp; Electronic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction and drug design. To accurately represent molecules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown potential in the realm of self-supervised pretraining. However, existing approaches often overlook the relationship between molecular structure and electronic information, as well as the internal semantic reasoning within molecules. This omission of fundamental chemical knowledge in graph semantics leads to incomplete molecular representations, missing the integration of structural and electronic data. To address these issues, we introduce MOL-Mamba, a framework that enhances molecular representation by combining structural and electronic insights. MOL-Mamba consists of an Atom &amp; Fragment Mamba-Graph (MG) for hierarchical structural reasoning and a Mamba-Transformer (MT) fuser for integrating molecular structure and electronic correlation learning. Additionally, we propose a Structural Distribution Collaborative Training and E-semantic Fusion Training framework to further enhance molecular representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOL-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across eleven chemical-biological molecular datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/xian-sh/MOL-Mamba.</description>

      <title>Point defect formation at finite temperatures with machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. The standard approach to modelling the thermodynamics of defects relies on a static description, where the change in Gibbs free energy is approximated by the internal energy. This approach has a low computational cost, but ignores contributions from atomic vibrations and structural configurations that can be accessed at finite temperatures. We train a machine learning force field (MLFF) to explore dynamic defect behaviour using $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ and $\textit{V}{\mathrm{_{Te}^{+2}}}$ in CdTe as exemplars. We consider the different entropic contributions (e.g., electronic, spin, vibrational, orientational, and configurational) and compare methods to compute the defect free energies, ranging from a harmonic treatment to a fully anharmonic approach based on thermodynamic integration. We find that metastable configurations are populated at room temperature and thermal effects increase the predicted concentration of $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ by two orders of magnitude -- and can thus significantly affect the predicted properties. Overall, our study underscores the importance of finite-temperature effects and the potential of MLFFs to model defect dynamics at both synthesis and device operating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of simultaneously emitting point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Shape of the Structural Relaxation in Deeply Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural relaxation in deeply supercooled liquids is non-exponential. In susceptibility representation, $\chi^{\prime\prime}(\nu)$, the spectral shape of the structural relaxation is observed as an asymmetrically broadened peak with a $\nu^{1}$ low- and $\nu^{-\beta}$ high-frequency behavior. In this perspective article we discuss common notions, recent results and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of $\nu^{-1/2}$ appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of different deeply supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. Additionally, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic $\nu^{-1/2}$ behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape towards higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface model for predicting the evolution of metallic negative electrodes and interfacial voids in solid-state batteries with homogeneous and polycrystalline solid electrolyte separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel diffuse-interface electrochemical model that simultaneously simulates the evolution of the metallic negative electrode and interfacial voids during the stripping and plating processes in solid-state batteries. The utility and validity of this model are demonstrated for the first time on a cell with a sodium (Na) negative electrode and a Na-$\beta^{\prime\prime}$-alumina ceramic solid electrolyte (SE) separator. Three examples are simulated. First, stripping and plating with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface; second, stripping and plating with a single interfacial void at the electrode/electrolyte interface; third, stripping with multiple interfacial voids. Both homogeneous SE properties and polycrystalline SEs with either low or high conductivity grain boundaries (GBs) are considered for all three examples. Heterogeneous GB conductivity has no significant impact on the behavior with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface. However, it does result in local changes to void growth due to interactions between the void edge and the GBs. The void growth rate is a linear function of the flux of Na atoms at the void edge, which in turn depends on the applied current density. We also show that the void coalescence rate increases with applied current density and can be marginally influenced by GB conductivity.</description>

      <title>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <title>A unified and consistent electrical double layer model for treatment of core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical double layer (EDL) is fundamental to the operation of devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Existing models of EDL in solid electrolytes focus predominantly on the space charge layer and lack a complete treatment of the core layer which is an integral part of the EDL. The core layer exhibits significant variations in defect properties, such as defect formation energy (DFE), which influence the ionic charge carrier distribution in the space charge layer. In this work, we develop a general framework for treating both the core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes under dilute and concentrated regimes. We incorporate functional forms of the DFE variation in the core layer and defect-defect interactions that are consistent with previous first-principles simulations of solid electrolytes at surfaces and interfaces. Our simulations reveal that the core layer significantly impacts the potential distribution and defect concentrations in the solid electrolyte. In addition, the core contributes substantially to the conductivity when the surface DFE is much lower than the bulk DFE. Our model paves the way for accurate calculations of properties such as capacitance and ionic conductivity of solid-solid interfaces required for enhancing and optimizing the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible in standard simulations. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. For a model system and chignolin in explicit water, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting in molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We use these accelerated simulations to infer important kinetic observables such as the unbiased mean first-passage time and direct transit time. For the latter, Metadynamics with informed resetting leads to speedups of 2-3 orders of magnitude over unbiased simulations with relative errors of only ~35-70%. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Active-Orbital-Based and Adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) Approaches to Excited Electronic States: Application to Potential Cuts of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first study using active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches to describe excited electronic states. These CC($P$;$Q$) methodologies are applied, alongside their completely renormalized (CR) coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC counterparts, to recover the ground- and excited-state potential cuts of the water molecule along the O-H bond-breaking coordinate obtained in the parent CC/EOMCC calculations with a full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT/EOMCCSDT). We demonstrate that the active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches closely approximate the CCSDT/EOMCCSDT data using significantly reduced computational costs while improving the CR-CC and CR-EOMCC energetics in stretched regions of the O-H bond-breaking potentials.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature quantum sensing with photoexcited triplet electrons in organic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</description>

      <title>ControlMol: Adding Substructure Control To Molecule Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the vast design space of molecules, generating molecules conditioned on a specific sub-structure relevant to a particular function or therapeutic target is a crucial task in computer-aided drug design. Existing works mainly focus on specific tasks, such as linker design or scaffold hopping, each task requires training a model from scratch, and many well-pretrained De Novo molecule generation model parameters are not effectively utilized. To this end, we propose a two-stage training approach, consisting of condition learning and condition optimization. In the condition learning stage, we adopt the idea of ControlNet and design some meaningful adjustments to make the unconditional generative model learn sub-structure conditioned generation. In the condition optimization stage, by using human preference learning, we further enhance the stability and robustness of sub-structure control. In our experiments, only trained on randomly partitioned sub-structure data, the proposed method outperforms previous techniques by generating more valid and diverse molecules. Our method is easy to implement and can be quickly applied to various pre-trained molecule generation models.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimal-rate error estimates and a twice decoupled solver for a backward Euler finite element scheme of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion batteries. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the solution in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a novel solver that accelerates the solution process and controls memory usage. Numerical experiments with realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed solver over existing solvers.</description>
