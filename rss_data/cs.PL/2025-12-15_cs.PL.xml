      <title>The Relative Monadic Metalanguage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative monads provide a controlled view of computation. We generalise the monadic metalanguage to a relative setting and give a complete semantics with strong relative monads. Adopting this perspective, we generalise two existing program calculi from the literature. We provide a linear-non-linear language for graded monads, LNL-RMM, along with a semantic proof that it is a conservative extension of the graded monadic metalanguage. Additionally, we provide a complete semantics for the arrow calculus, showing it is a restricted relative monadic metalanguage. This motivates the introduction of ARMM, a computational lambda calculus-style language for arrows that conservatively extends the arrow calculus.</description>

      <title>Agentic Operator Generation for ML ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TritorX, an agentic AI system designed to generate functionally correct Triton PyTorch ATen kernels at scale for emerging accelerator platforms. TritorX integrates open-source large language models with a custom linter, JIT compilation, and a PyTorch OpInfo-based test harness. This pipeline is compatible with both real Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) silicon and in hardware simulation environments for next-generation devices. In contrast to previous kernel-generation approaches that prioritize performance for a limited set of high-usage kernels, TritorX prioritizes coverage. Our system emphasizes correctness and generality across the entire operator set, including diverse data types, shapes, and argument patterns. In our experiments, TritorX successfully generated kernels and wrappers for 481 unique ATen operators that pass all corresponding PyTorch OpInfo tests (over 20,000 in total). TritorX paves the way for overnight generation of complete PyTorch ATen backends for new accelerator platforms.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of GPU-Native Compilation for Rapid Code Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI code generation systems suffer from significant latency bottlenecks due to CPU-GPU data transfers during compilation, execution, and testing phases. We establish theoretical foundations for three complementary approaches to GPU-native compilation that eliminate these transfers: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies. We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness. We formalize the probabilistic verification framework that enables trading compilation accuracy for parallel exploration, and discuss implications for self-improving AI systems and future analog computing substrates.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Effects and Concurrency in Guarded Interaction Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guarded Interaction Trees are a structure and a fully formalized framework for representing higher-order computations with higher-order effects in Rocq. We present an extension of Guarded Interaction Trees to support formal reasoning about context-dependent effects. That is, effects whose behaviors depend on the evaluation context, e.g., call/cc, shift and reset. Using and reasoning about such effects is challenging since certain compositionality principles no longer hold in the presence of such effects. For example, the so-called ``bind rule'' in modern program logics is no longer valid. The goal of our extension is to support representation and reasoning about context-dependent effects in the most painless way possible. To that end, our extension is conservative: the reasoning principles for context-independent effects remain the same. We use it to give direct-style denotational semantics for higher-order programming languages with call/cc and with delimited continuations. We extend the program logic for Guarded Interaction Trees to account for context-dependent effects, and we use the program logic to prove that the denotational semantics is adequate with respect to the operational semantics. Additionally, we retain the ability to combine multiple effects in a modular way, which we demonstrate by showing type soundness for safe interoperability of a programming language with delimited continuations and a programming language with higher-order store. Furthermore, as another contribution, in addition to context-dependent effects, we show how to extend Guarded Interaction Trees with preemptive concurrency. To support implementation and verification of concurrent data structures and algorithms in the presence of preemptive concurrency one requires atomic state modification operations, e.g., compare-and-exchange.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methods for the Cross-Level Verification of SystemC Peripherals with Symbolic Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development. At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches modify and replace the SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely, and would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different levels of abstractions. Both tools' extensive sets of features are demonstrated for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling cross-level verification with symbolic execution.</description>

      <title>The Ghosts of Empires: Extracting Modularity from Interleaving-Based Proofs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementation bugs threaten the soundness of algorithmic software verifiers. Generating correctness certificates for correct programs allows for efficient independent validation of verification results, and thus helps to reveal such bugs. Automatic generation of small, compact correctness proofs for concurrent programs is challenging, as the correctness arguments may depend on the particular interleaving, which can lead to exponential explosion. We present an approach that converts an interleaving-based correctness proof, as generated by many algorithmic verifiers, into a thread-modular correctness proof in the style of Owicki and Gries. We automatically synthesize ghost variables that capture the relevant interleaving information, and abstract away irrelevant details. Our evaluation shows that the approach is efficient in practice and generates compact proofs, compared to a baseline.</description>

      <title>REASONING COMPILER: LLM-Guided Optimizations for Efficient Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</description>
