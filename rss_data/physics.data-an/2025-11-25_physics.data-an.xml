      <title>Diffusion Signals Reveal Hidden Connections: A Physics-Inspired Framework for Link Prediction via Personalized PageRank Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction in complex networks--identifying the missing or future connections--remains a cornerstone problem for understanding network evolution and function, yet existing methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with theoretical rigor across heterogeneous topologies. This work introduces a physically principled framework, Diffusion Distance with Personalized PageRank (D-PPR), which unifies static topology with dynamic information flow by modeling nodes as signal sources propagating through the network via Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors. The method quantifies node-pair similarity through the graph Laplacian-governed diffusion distance between their topology-aware signal distributions, thereby bridging microscopic interactions with macroscopic network dynamics. Systematic benchmarking on synthetic (Barab\'asi-Albert, LFR) and seven large-scale real-world networks spanning technology, biology, and social domains demonstrates that D-PPR achieves highly competitive performance, yielding favorable results when compared to representative local and global heuristics, particularly in sparse and modular networks. These findings establish a rigorous foundation for physics-inspired link prediction by revealing that incorporating dynamical processes into structural similarity metrics enables deeper insights into network connectivity patterns, offering both methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives on the interplay between topology and dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the coupled entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled entropy is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be equivalent to the density at the scale for scale-shape distributions. Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination.</description>

      <title>Physically Informed Bayesian Retrieval of SWE and Snow Depth in Forested Areas from Airborne X And Ku-Band SAR Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a coupled physical statistical framework for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested areas using dual frequency X and Ku band SAR observations. The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Material Classification via Reference-Free Terahertz Spectroscopy: Revisiting Spectral Referencing and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how feature selection algorithms can enable accurate, reference-free classification of materials using sparse-frequency terahertz (THz) reflection spectroscopy. Three classes of feature selection strategies are evaluated. Namely, the filter-based mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), the embedded LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and the wrapper-based SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithms. Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Na\"ive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts. These findings highlights that reducing spectral dimensionality through data-driven selection eliminates the need for broadband sources and reference measurements, enabling compact, application-specific THz sensors. This approach offers robust material identification in real-world scenarios such as security screening, non-destructive testing, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Inclinations and Position Angles for Disc Galaxies in the SGA sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for determining the inclination and position angle (PA) of disc galaxies using a Fourier-Laguerre basis decomposition of imaging data. We define a dimensionless metric, $\eta$, that characterises the ratio of the quadrupole and monopole coefficients in the Fourier-Laguerre basis function expansion. This metric serves as a robust measure which is related to the inclination of a galaxy. We find an empirical relationship between $\eta$ and inclination which is agnostic to the galaxy morphology. The PA is derived directly from the phase of the quadrupolar Fourier-Laguerre functions. Across a benchmark sample of galaxies, the method reproduces published inclination and PA values to within a median of 10$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$, respectively, while also demonstrating essentially zero catastrophic failures. Applying this pipeline to galaxies from the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA), we report measurements of $\eta$, scale length and PA for three different bands of 133,942 disc galaxies. Our computationally inexpensive technique automates parametrisation analysis and returns reproducible results for large surveys. We release a Python package ready for application to next generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Guesswork in the gap: the impact of uncertainty in the compact binary population on source classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the compact objects within the supposed "lower mass gap" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by &lt;10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.</description>

      <title>Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</description>
