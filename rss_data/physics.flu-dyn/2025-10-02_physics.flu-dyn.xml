      <title>Pumping and Steady Streaming driven by Two-Frequency Oscillations of a Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical problem of steady streaming induced by an oscillating object has been studied extensively, but prior work has focused almost exclusively on single-frequency oscillations, which result in symmetric, quadrupole-like flows. Here we demonstrate that dual-frequency oscillations induce asymmetric steady streaming with a non-zero net flux in a direction determined by the polarity of the oscillation \ -- the oscillator serves as a pump. We use numerical simulations and asymptotic analysis at low Reynolds number to examine 2D steady streaming around a cylinder, first focusing on frequency ratio two. The computational experiments show asymmetrical streaming and pumping, i.e., net flux downstream. It is well known from asymptotic analysis that steady streaming is second order in amplitude, and we show pumping occurs at third order. We then extend the analysis to general frequency ratios, where we give necessary conditions for pumping and predict the order in amplitude at which pumping occurs. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with computational simulations for different frequency ratios, and we discuss the implications for using dual-mode vibrations to pump fluids in lab-on-a-chip and other applications.</description>

      <title>Fluid Deformation in Random Unsteady Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid deformation controls myriad processes including mixing and dispersion, development of stress in complex fluids, droplet breakup and emulsification, fluid-structure interaction, chemical reactions and biological activity. We develop a simple stochastic model for fluid deformation in random unsteady flows such as homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that although the Lagrangian velocity process is non-Markovian and non-Fickian, temporal decorrelation due to the unsteady nature of the flow renders the evolution of the Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor to be Fickian. Application of a coordinate transform renders the velocity gradient tensor upper triangular, eliminating vortical rotation and decoupling principal stretches from shear deformations, leading to a stochastic model of fluid deformation as a simple Brownian process. We develop closed-form expressions for the evolution of the Cauchy-Green tensor and show that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are Gaussian distribution. Application of this model to DNS calculations of forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds number Re$_\lambda\approx 433$, confirms the underlying model assumptions and provides excellent agreement with theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Bouncing to coalescence transition for droplet impact onto moving liquid pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A droplet impacting a deep fluid bath is as common as rain over the ocean. If the impact is sufficiently gentle, the mediating air layer remains intact, and the droplet may rebound completely from the interface. In this work, we experimentally investigate the role of translational bath motion on the bouncing to coalescence transition. Over a range of parameters, we find that the relative bath motion systematically decreases the normal Weber number required to transition from bouncing to merging. Direct numerical simulations demonstrate that the depression created during impact combined with the translational motion of the bath enhances the air layer drainage on the upstream side of the droplet, ultimately favoring coalescence. A simple geometric argument is presented that rationalizes the collapse of the experimental threshold data, extending what is known for the case of axisymmetric normal impacts to the more general 3D scenario of interest herein.</description>

      <title>RheOFormer: A generative transformer model for simulation of complex fluids and flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Creases as elastocapillary gates for autonomous droplet control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets are the core functional units in microfluidic technologies that aim to integrate computation and reaction on a single platform. Achieving directed transport and control of these droplets typically demands elaborate substrate patterning, modulation of external fields, and real-time feedback. Here we reveal that an engineered pattern of creases on a soft interface autonomously gate and steer droplets through a long-range elastocapillary repulsion, allowing programmable flow of information. Acting as an energy barrier, the crease bars incoming droplets below a critical size, without making contact. We uncover the multi-scale, repulsive force-distance law describing interactions between a drop and a singular crease. Leveraging this mechanism, we demonstrate passive and active filtration based on droplet size and surface tension, and implement functionalities such as path guidance, tunable hysterons, pulse modulators, and elementary logic operations like adders. This crease-based gating approach thus demonstrates complex in-unit processing capabilities - typically accessible only through sophisticated surface and fluidic modifications - offering a multimodal, potentially rewritable strategy for droplet control in interfacial assembly and biochemical assays.</description>

      <title>Chemical transport by weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves in stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is well-known that internal gravity waves (IGWs) transport chemicals in the radiative zones of stars, there remains substantial uncertainty on the amount of, and physical mechanism behind, this transport. Most previous studies have relied on heuristic theories, or numerical simulations that may be hard to extrapolate to stellar parameters. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic calculation of (passive) chemical transport by IGWs, in the limit of small wave amplitude. We find that the net transport by a coherent packet of waves scales like wave amplitude to the fourth power, and verify these analytic calculations with numerical simulations. Because the transport is equally likely to be positive as negative, the transport by a random superposition of waves is expected to scale as wave amplitude to the eighth power. These results show that closer comparisons between theoretical arguments and numerical calculations are essential for interpreting numerical simulations of chemical transport by IGWs, and making accurate predictions of this process for stellar evolution modeling.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular rod wake/aerofoil interaction: microphone array and TR-PIV insights via SPOD and beamforming analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the acoustic and velocity fields due to a circular rod and an aerofoil placed in the wake of, and perpendicular to, a rod. Simultaneous measurements were conducted using a microphone array and time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV). The interaction was characterized through acoustic spectra and the coherence between microphone signals and the three velocity components. Coherent structures were identified with Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) using a norm based either on turbulence kinetic energy (SPOD-u) or on pressure (SPOD-p). An advantage of SPOD-p is that it identifies velocity modes associated with a large acoustic energy. Peaks of energy were observed at $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$ and $0.4$--Strouhal numbers based on rod diameter and free-stream velocity. At $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$, the dominant feature is von K\'arm\'an vortex shedding from the rod. At $\mathit{St} \approx 0.4$, a wave-train structure in the rod wake impinging on the aerofoil leading edge is captured by the rank-1 SPOD-p mode, with coherence levels reaching 60\% for the $u_2$ component (upwash/downwash relative to the aerofoil). This structure also appears at $\mathit{St} \approx 0.2$, but as the rank-2 SPOD-p mode. A mode-switching occurs around $\mathit{St} \approx 0.3$: below this value, the rank-1 mode corresponds to von K\'arm\'an shedding (cylinder branch), while above it, the rank-1 mode tracks the interaction of the aerofoil with the rod wake (aerofoil branch). Both branches were also identified via beamforming using low-rank cross-spectral matrices derived from SPOD-p modes.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method, which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions efficiently. The space-time method enables straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results indicate that, under certain conditions, the discontinuity of the initial porosity influences the distribution of incompatible trace elements, leading to sharp concentration gradients and large degrees of elemental enrichment. Finally, our results indicate that the enrichment of trace elements depends not only on the channelization of the flow but also on the interaction of fluid-filled channels with layers of different porosity and permeability.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>
