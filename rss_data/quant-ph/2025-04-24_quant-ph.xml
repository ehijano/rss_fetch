      <title>The DKP Equation in Presence of a Woods-Saxon Potential: Transmission Resonances and Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in the presence of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier and well for spin-one particles. We derive the scattering solution in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, the regularized Gaussian hypergeometric function ${}_2\tilde{F}_1(a, b; c; z)$, and the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$. Our analysis reveals the presence of transmission resonances. To observe these resonances, we calculate and plot the transmission $T$ and reflection $R$ coefficients for various parameters of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Our results are compared with those obtained for the square potential barrier and the cusp potential barrier, which represent limiting cases of the Woods-Saxon potential barrier. Furthermore, we investigate the bound state solutions, determining the critical turning point $V_{cr}$ to study particle-antiparticle creation and compute the norm $N$. Finally, we also compare our results with those obtained for the square potential well and the cusp potential well, confirming that pair creation occurs in both potential wells.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have fueled significant research efforts aimed at integrating these two transformative technologies. Quantum machine learning (QML), an emerging interdisciplinary field, leverages quantum principles to enhance the performance of ML algorithms. Concurrently, the exploration of systematic and automated approaches for designing high-performance quantum circuit architectures for QML tasks has gained prominence, as these methods empower researchers outside the quantum computing domain to effectively utilize quantum-enhanced tools. This tutorial will provide an in-depth overview of recent breakthroughs in both areas, highlighting their potential to expand the application landscape of QML across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Mixed-State Cluster States and Spurious Topological Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate 1D and 2D cluster states under local decoherence to assess the robustness of their mixed-state subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) order. By exactly computing fidelity correlators via dimensional reduction of effective statistical mechanics models, we pinpoint the critical error rate for strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of strong subsystem symmetry. Without resorting to the replica trick, we demonstrate that mixed-state SSPT order remains remarkably robust up to the maximal decoherence rate when noise respects strong subsystem symmetry. Furthermore, we propose that the mixed-state SSPT order can be detected by a constant correction to the area-law scaling of entanglement negativity, termed spurious topological entanglement negativity. This also highlights that topological entanglement negativity, a widely used diagnostic for mixed-state topological order, is generally not invariant under finite-depth quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Retrodiction of measurement outcomes on a single quantum system reveals entanglement with its environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density matrix yields probabilistic information about the outcome of measurements on a quantum system, but it does not distinguish between classical randomness in the preparation of the system and entanglement with its environment. Here, we show that retrodiction, employing both prior and posterior knowledge, gives rise to conditional probabilities for measurements on a single system, that can witness if it is part of a larger composite system. The degree of certainty with which one can retrodict the outcomes of multiple measurements on a system can witness both the existence and the quantitative nature of its entanglement with the environment.</description>

      <title>On a modified quantum theory with objective quantum thermalization and spontaneous universal irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation are based on agent-specific restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a minimal extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows isolated, macroscopic systems to thermalize, with an objective notion of thermalization. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physicality constraints including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium statistics. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum to classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. This model admits spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid, Born-Maxwell-Boltzmann-Gibbs-microcanonical distribution for ensembles.</description>

      <title>Injection locking of Rydberg dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Rydberg gases exhibit exotic many-body phases stabilized by the interplay of coherent interactions and dissipation. Strong Rydberg interactions drive sustained limit cycle oscillations, whose robustness, long-range temporal order, and spontaneous time-translation symmetry breaking establish a dissipative time crystal (DTC). Collective self-entrainment in driven ensembles leads to global synchronization and a dominant oscillation frequency. Here, injection locking of a Rydberg DTC is demonstrated using a radio-frequency (RF) electric field that gradually pulls the intrinsic oscillation toward the injected frequency. Above a critical threshold, full synchronization occurs, with the locking bandwidth scaling linearly with RF amplitude. This includes synchronization of higher-order harmonics, revealing entrainment of the system nonlinear temporal dynamics. The phenomenon parallels injection locking in classical nonlinear systems, but emerges here in a strongly interacting quantum medium. This approach establishes a new method for stabilizing and controlling quantum temporal order, with applications in precision sensing, quantum metrology, and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization and entanglement of two magnon modes in a magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the improvement of the entanglement between the indirectly coupled two magnon modes in a magnomechanical system with magnon squeezing. We quantify the degree of entanglement via logarithmic negativity between two magnon modes. We show a significant enhancement of entanglement via magnon squeezing. Additionally, the entanglement of two magnons decreases monotonically under thermal effects. We demonstrate that with an increasing photon tunneling rate, entanglement is robust and resistant to thermal effects. We use purity as a witness to the mixing between the two magnon modes. We show that synchronization and purity are very robust against thermal effects rather than entanglement. We examine the relationship between quantum entanglement, purity, and quantum synchronization in both steady and dynamic states. According to our results, this scheme could be a promising platform for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Kronecker states: a powerful source of multipartite maximally entangled states in quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, maximally entangled states, specifically locally maximally entangled (LME) states, are essential for quantum protocols. While many focus on bipartite entanglement, applications such as quantum error correction and multiparty secret sharing rely on multipartite entanglement. These LME states naturally appear in the invariant subspaces of tensor products of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$, called Kronecker subspaces, whose dimensions are the Kronecker coefficients. A Kronecker subspace is a space of multipartite LME states that entangle high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although these states can be derived from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $S_n$, known methods are inefficient even for small $n$. A quantum-information-based alternative comes from entanglement concentration protocols, where Kronecker subspaces arise in the isotypic decomposition of multiple copies of entangled states. Closed forms have been found for the multiqubit $W$-class states, but not in general. This thesis extends that approach to any multiqubit system. We first propose a graphical construction called W-state Stitching, where multiqubit entangled states are represented as tensor networks built from $W$ states. By analyzing the isotypic decomposition of copies of these graph states, corresponding graph Kronecker states can be constructed. In particular, graph states of generic multiqubit systems can generate any Kronecker subspace. We explicitly construct bases for three- and four-qubit systems and show that the W-stitching technique also serves as a valuable tool for multiqubit entanglement classification. These results may open new directions in multipartite entanglement resource theories, with bipartite and tripartite $W$ states as foundational elements, and asymptotic analysis based on Kronecker states.</description>

      <title>Quantum reinforcement learning of classical rare dynamics: Enhancement by intrinsic Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events are essential for understanding the behavior of non-equilibrium and industrial systems. It is of ongoing interest to develop methods for effectively searching for rare events. With the advent of quantum computing and its potential advantages over classical computing for applications like sampling certain probability distributions, the question arises whether quantum computers could also provide an advantage or inspire new methods for sampling the statistics of rare events. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method for studying rare dynamics, and we investigate their benefits over classical approaches based on neural networks. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrate that our QRL agents can learn and generate the rare dynamics of random walks, and we are able to explain this success as well as the different contributing factors to it via the intrinsic Fourier features of the parameterized quantum circuit. Furthermore, we show better learning behavior with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This is the first investigation of QRL applied to generating rare events and suggests that QRL is a promising method to study their dynamics and statistics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits Of Quickest Change-point Detection With Continuous-Variable Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the quantum CUSUM (QUSUM) algorithm for quickest change-point detection, analyzed in finite dimensions by Fanizza, Hirche, and Calsamiglia (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020602, 2023), to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of a result by Hayashi (Hayashi, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 3413, 2001) concerning the asymptotics of quantum relative entropy, which we establish for the infinite-dimensional setting. This enables us to prove that the QUSUM strategy retains its asymptotic optimality, characterized by the relationship between the expected detection delay and the average false alarm time for any pair of states with finite relative entropy. Consequently, our findings apply broadly, including continuous-variable systems (e.g., Gaussian states), facilitating the development of optimal change-point detection schemes in quantum optics and other physical platforms, and rendering experimental verification feasible.</description>

      <title>Ultimate quantum sensitivity in the 3D relative localisation of two single-photon emitters via two-photon interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum sensing protocol for the simultaneous estimation of the difference in the localization parameters of two single-photon sources, paving the way to single-photon 3D imaging and 3D nanoscopy beyond the diffraction limit. This is achieved by exploiting two-photon interference of the two emitted photons at a beam splitter via sampling measurements in the frequency and transverse momenta at the output. We prove theoretically that this technique reaches the ultimate sensitivity in the 3D relative localization of two emitters, already with a number of sampling measurements of 1000 and a bias in the three localization parameters below 1%. These results are independent of the values of the localization parameters to estimate.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Simulated Noisy Quantum Data Collection by Orders of Magnitude Using Pre-Trajectory Sampling with Batched Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically simulating quantum systems is challenging, as even noiseless $n$-qubit quantum states scale as $2^n$. The complexity of noisy quantum systems is even greater, requiring $2^n \times 2^n$-dimensional density matrices. Various approximations reduce density matrix overhead, including quantum trajectory-based methods, which instead use an ensemble of $m \ll 2^n$ noisy states. While this method is dramatically more efficient, current implementations use unoptimized sampling, redundant state preparation, and single-shot data collection. In this manuscript, we present the Pre-Trajectory Sampling technique, increasing the efficiency and utility of trajectory simulations by tailoring error types, batching sampling without redundant computation, and collecting error information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both a mature statevector simulation of a 35-qubit quantum error-correction code and a preliminary tensor network simulation of 85 qubits, yielding speedups of up to $10^6$x and $16$x, as well as generating massive datasets of one trillion and one million shots, respectively.</description>

      <title>Flexion: Adaptive In-Situ Encoding for On-Demand QEC in Ion Trap Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware and quantum error correction (QEC) have set the stage for early demonstrations of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). A key near-term goal is to build a system capable of executing millions of logical operations reliably -- referred to as a megaquop quantum computer (MQC). In this work, we propose a novel system architecture targeting MQC on trapped-ion quantum computers (TIQC), leveraging their ultra-high-fidelity single-qubit gates (1Q) and efficient two-qubit (2Q) logical CNOT gates enabled by the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture with the ion shuttling feature.
  We propose Flexion, a hybrid encoding scheme that uses bare qubits for 1Q gates and QEC-encoded logical qubits for 2Q gates. This approach avoids fully encoding all qubits, eliminating the overhead of gate synthesis, teleportation, and magic state distillation for non-Clifford gates. To support this, we design (1) a low-noise conversion protocol between bare and logical qubits, (2) a bare-logical hybrid instruction set architecture tailored for 2D grid-based TIQC, and (3) a compiler that minimizes conversion cost and optimizes the scheduling efficiency. We evaluate our approach on VQA and small-scale FTQC benchmarks, showing that it achieves superior performance improvements with significantly reduced resource overhead, offering a practical path toward early FTQC on TIQC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of classical behavior from quantum mechanics as Planck's constant $\hbar$ approaches zero remains a fundamental challenge in physics [1-3]. This paper introduces a novel approach employing deep neural networks to directly learn the dynamical mapping from initial quantum state parameters (for Gaussian wave packets of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator) and $\hbar$ to the parameters of the time-evolved Wigner function in phase space [4-6]. A comprehensive dataset of analytically derived time-evolved Wigner functions was generated, and a deep feedforward neural network with an enhanced architecture was successfully trained for this prediction task, achieving a final training loss of ~ 0.0390. The network demonstrates a significant and previously unrealized ability to accurately capture the underlying mapping of the Wigner function dynamics. This allows for a direct emulation of the quantum-classical transition by predicting the evolution of phase-space distributions as $\hbar$ is systematically varied. The implications of these findings for providing a new computational lens on the emergence of classicality are discussed, highlighting the potential of this direct phase-space learning approach for studying fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. This work presents a significant advancement beyond previous efforts that focused on learning observable mappings [7], offering a direct route via the phase-space representation.</description>

      <title>QAOA-GPT: Efficient Generation of Adaptive and Regular Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to improve our ability to solve certain optimization problems that are computationally difficult for classical computers, by offering new algorithmic approaches that may provide speedups under specific conditions. In this work, we introduce QAOA-GPT, a generative framework that leverages Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) to directly synthesize quantum circuits for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, and demonstrate it on the MaxCut problem on graphs. To diversify the training circuits and ensure their quality, we have generated a synthetic dataset using the adaptive QAOA approach, a method that incrementally builds and optimizes problem-specific circuits. The experiments conducted on a curated set of graph instances demonstrate that QAOA-GPT, generates high quality quantum circuits for new problem instances unseen in the training as well as successfully parametrizes QAOA. Our results show that using QAOA-GPT to generate quantum circuits will significantly decrease both the computational overhead of classical QAOA and adaptive approaches that often use gradient evaluation to generate the circuit and the classical optimization of the circuit parameters. Our work shows that generative AI could be a promising avenue to generate compact quantum circuits in a scalable way.</description>

      <title>Learning functions of Hamiltonians with Hamiltonian Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum machine learning task that is provably easy for quantum computers and arguably hard for classical ones. The task involves predicting quantities of the form $\mathrm{Tr}[f(H)\rho]$, where $f$ is an unknown function, given descriptions of $H$ and $\rho$. Using a Fourier-based feature map of Hamiltonians and linear regression, we theoretically establish the learnability of the task and implement it on a superconducting device using up to 40 qubits. This work provides a machine learning task with practical relevance, provable quantum easiness, and near-term feasibility.</description>

      <title>Scalable and modular generation of multipartite entangled states through memory-enhanced fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</description>

      <title>Public-Key Quantum Fire and Key-Fire From Classical Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fire was recently formalized by Bostanci, Nehoran and Zhandry (STOC 25). This notion considers a distribution of quantum states that can be efficiently cloned, but cannot be converted into a classical string. Previously, work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 24) showed how to construct quantum fire relative to an inefficient unitary oracle. Later, the work of Bostanci, Nehoran, Zhandry gave a candidate construction based on group action assumptions, and proved the correctness of their scheme; however, even in the classical oracle model they only conjectured the security, and no security proof was given.
  In this work, we give the first construction of public-key quantum fire relative to a classical oracle, and prove its security unconditionally. This gives the first classical oracle seperation between the two fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are equivalent in the information-theoretic setting: no-cloning and no-telegraphing.
  Going further, we introduce a stronger notion called quantum key-fire where the clonable fire states can be used to run a functionality (such as a signing or decryption key), and prove a secure construction relative to a classical oracle. As an application of this notion, we get the first public-key encryption scheme whose secret key is clonable but satisfies unbounded leakage-resilience (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro [TCC 24]), relative to a classical oracle. Unbounded leakage-resilience is closely related to, and can be seen as a generalization of the notion of no-telegraphing.
  For all of our constructions, the oracles can be made efficient (i.e. polynomial time), assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions.</description>

      <title>Qubit Geometry through Holomorphic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a wave mechanics formalism for qubit geometry using holomorphic functions and Mobius transformations, providing a geometric perspective on quantum computation. This framework extends the standard Hilbert space description, offering a natural interpretation of standard quantum gates on the Riemann sphere that is examined through their Mobius action on holomorphic wavefunction. These wavefunctions emerge via a quantization process, with the Riemann sphere serving as the classical phase space of qubit geometry. We quantize this space using canonical group quantization with holomorphic polarization, yielding holomorphic wavefunctions and spin angular momentum operators that recover the standard $SU(2)$ algebra with interesting geometric properties. Such properties reveal how geometric transformations induce quantum logic gates on the Riemann sphere, providing a novel perspective in quantum information processing. This result provides a new direction for exploring quantum computation through Isham's canonical group quantization and its holomorphic polarization method.</description>

      <title>Achieving the positivity of the secret key in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Woodhead [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{88}, 012331 (2013)] derived the lower bound of the secret key rate for a Bennett-Brassard (BB84) like quantum key distribution protocol under collective attacks. However, this lower bound does not always assure the generation of the secret key and thus the protocol may have to be aborted sometimes. Thus, we modify the Woodhead's lower bound of the secret key rate in such a way that the secret key is always generated in a BB84 like quantum key distribution protocol. Exploiting the obtained modified lower bound of the secret key rate, we analyze two state dependent quantum cloning machines such as (i) Wootters-Zurek QCM and (ii) Modified Buzek-Hillery QCM constructed by fixing the cloning machine parameters of Buzek Hillery quantum cloning machine (QCM), which may be used by the eavesdropper to extract information from the intercepted state. We, thereafter, show that it is possible for the communicating parties to distill a secret key, even in the presence of an eavesdropper. Moreover, we also discuss the effect of the efficiency of the QCM on the generation of the secret key for a successful key distribution protocol.</description>

      <title>HAQA: A Hardware-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Strategy for Efficient Qubit Mapping Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms rely on quantum computers for implementation, but the physical connectivity constraints of modern quantum processors impede the efficient realization of quantum algorithms. Qubit mapping, a critical technology for practical quantum computing applications, directly determines the execution efficiency and feasibility of algorithms on superconducting quantum processors. Existing mapping methods overlook intractable quantum hardware fidelity characteristics, reducing circuit execution quality. They also exhibit prolonged solving times or even failure to complete when handling large-scale quantum architectures, compromising efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel qubit mapping method HAQA. HAQA first introduces a community-based iterative region identification strategy leveraging hardware connection topology, achieving effective dimensionality reduction of mapping space. This strategy avoids global search procedures, with complexity analysis demonstrating quadratic polynomial-level acceleration. Furthermore, HAQA implements a hardware-characteristic-based region evaluation mechanism, enabling quantitative selection of mapping regions based on fidelity metrics. This approach effectively integrates hardware fidelity information into the mapping process, enabling fidelity-aware qubit allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that HAQA significantly improves solving speed and fidelity while ensuring solution quality. When applied to state-of-the-art quantum mapping techniques Qsynth-v2 and TB-OLSQ2, HAQA achieves acceleration ratios of 632.76 and 286.87 respectively, while improving fidelity by up to 52.69% and 238.28%</description>

      <title>Experimentally Certifying Kochen-Specker Set with the Maximally Mixed State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying Kochen-Specker (KS) set is a task of certifying a set of uncharacterized projectors as desired KS set. This work demonstrates an improved scheme that enables this certification using only a maximally mixed state, rather than traversing over all states, making it experimental feasible. In this scheme, outcomes obtained from sequential measurements are used for the evaluation of the worst result and its certification threshold, based on the characteristics of maximally mixed state and a semi-definite program. Experimentally, a group of projectors closely approximating the KS set Peres-24 is certified in an optical system, highlighting the feasibility of this scheme in certifying KS set. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is presented by manually adding errors to the optical system, demonstrating a strict level of experimental imperfection in achieving successful certification. These results offer a new perspective on characterizing measurements from quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Determining Strong Contextuality on rank-one Projectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of quantum contextuality is closely related to quantum computation power. Yu-Oh set is the minimal quantum system with state-independent contextuality(SIC). However, its strength of the contextuality has not been taken into account. In this paper, we present a general method to determine whether there is a quantum state with strong contextuality in the quantum system composed of rank-one projectors. Based on this method, we conclude that Yu-Oh set does not have quantum states with strong contextuality. This indicates that strong contextuality and SIC are mutually independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), enhances quantum cryptography by mitigating detector-side vulnerabilities. This study analyzes MDI-QKD performance in thermal-loss and phase noise channels, modeled as depolarizing and dephasing channels to capture thermal and phase noise effects. Based on this channel framework, we derive analytical expressions for Bell state measurement probabilities, quantum bit error rates (QBER), and secret key rates (SKR) of MDI-QKD. Our simulations reveal that SKR decreases exponentially with transmission distance, with performance further degraded by increasing thermal noise and phase noise, particularly under high thermal noise conditions. These findings offer insights into enhancing MDI-QKD's noise resilience, supporting secure key generation in practical, noisy environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have been widely studied for quantum sensing applications. In this work, we demonstrate that flavin-based cryptochrome proteins, which generate radical pairs upon optical excitation, also exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance. We further show that this optical spin interface is tunable by the protein structure. These findings establish radical pairs in proteins as a novel platform for optically addressable spin systems and magnetic field sensors. Additionally, the ability to control spin transitions introduces a new class of biophysical tools that hold promise for enabling multiplexed fluorescence microscopy. Importantly, due to the spin-selective nature of radical pair chemistry, the results lay the groundwork for radiofrequency-based manipulation of biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of two distinguishable particles with unequal masses and a mutual short-range interaction with the aim of quantifying the impact of a tunneling ``projectile'' particle on the quantum mechanical state of the ``barrier'' particle. We find that the states of the barrier particle after the tunneling or reflection of the projectile are displaced by a finite distance that is given by the derivative of the phase of the transmission or reflection amplitudes multiplied by factors dependent on particles' masses, respectively. We demonstrate these results on a numerical example with a resonant interaction between a projectile and barrier. Our work demonstrates physical implication of the concept of phase time delay in the form of finite displacements of particles that are, in principle, experimentally measurable.</description>

      <title>Optimization Framework for Reducing Mid-circuit Measurements and Resets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the optimization of dynamic circuits in quantum computing, with a focus on reducing the cost of mid-circuit measurements and resets. We extend the probabilistic circuit model (PCM) and implement an optimization framework that targets both mid-circuit measurements and resets. To overcome the limitation of the prior PCM-based pass, where optimizations are only possible on pure single-qubit states, we incorporate circuit synthesis to enable optimizations on multi-qubit states. With a parameter $n_{pcm}$, our framework balances optimization level against resource usage.We evaluate our framework using a large dataset of randomly generated dynamic circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is highly effective in reducing mid-circuit measurements and resets. In our demonstrative example, when applying our optimization framework to the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm after employing qubit reuse, we significantly reduce its runtime overhead by removing all of the resets.</description>

      <title>Path Matters: Industrial Data Meet Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world optimization problems must undergo a series of transformations before becoming solvable on current quantum hardware. Even for a fixed problem, the number of possible transformation paths -- from industry-relevant formulations through binary constrained linear programs (BILPs), to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and finally to a hardware-executable representation -- is remarkably large. Each step introduces free parameters, such as Lagrange multipliers, encoding strategies, slack variables, rounding schemes or algorithmic choices -- making brute-force exploration of all paths intractable. In this work, we benchmark a representative subset of these transformation paths using a real-world industrial production planning problem with industry data: the optimization of work allocation in a press shop producing vehicle parts. We focus on QUBO reformulations and algorithmic parameters for both quantum annealing (QA) and the Linear Ramp Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (LR-QAOA). Our goal is to identify a reduced set of effective configurations applicable to similar industrial settings. Our results show that QA on D-Wave hardware consistently produces near-optimal solutions, whereas LR-QAOA on IBM quantum devices struggles to reach comparable performance. Hence, the choice of hardware and solver strategy significantly impacts performance. The problem formulation and especially the penalization strategy determine the solution quality. Most importantly, mathematically-defined penalization strategies are equally successful as hand-picked penalty factors, paving the way for automated QUBO formulation. Moreover, we observe a strong correlation between simulated and quantum annealing performance metrics, offering a scalable proxy for predicting QA behavior on larger problem instances.</description>

Abstract: The method is introduced for fast data processing by reducing the probability amplitudes of undesirable elements. The algorithm has a mathematical description and circuit implementation on a quantum processor. The idea is to make a quick decision (down to a single iteration) based on the correspondence between the data and the desired result, with a probability proportionate to this correspondence. Our approach allows one to calibrate the circuit to control specified proportions.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimality of pulses for robust population transfer in a ladder-type qutrit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16646v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-modulation schemes have recently emerged as alternatives to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models, such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models, we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives and amplitude robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk search for exceptional configurations on one- and two-dimensional lattice with extra long-range edges of HN4 network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist several types of configurations of marked vertices, referred to as the exceptional configurations, on one- and two-dimensional periodic lattices with additional long-range edges of the HN4 network, which are challenging to find using discrete-time quantum walk algorithms. In this article, we conduct a comparative analysis of the discrete-time quantum walk algorithm utilizing various coin operators to search for these exceptional configurations. First, we study the emergence of several new exceptional configurations/vertices due to the additional long-range edges of the HN4 network on both one- and two-dimensional lattices. Second, our study shows that the diagonal configuration on a two-dimensional lattice, which is exceptional in the case without long-range edges, no longer remains an exceptional configuration. Third, it is also shown that a recently proposed modified coin can search all these configurations, including any other configurations in one- and two-dimensional lattices with very high success probability. Additionally, we construct stationary states for the exceptional configurations caused by the additional long-range edges, which explains why the standard and lackadaisical quantum walks with the Grover coin cannot search these configurations.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>

      <title>Resource Reduction in Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing of both Classical and Quantum Information under Noisy Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) enables secure distribution of information among multiple parties but remains vulnerable to noise. We analyze the effects of bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude damping noise on the multiparty QSS for classical message (QSSCM) and secret sharing of quantum information (SSQI) protocols proposed by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 71:044301, 2005). To scale down these effects, we introduce an efficient quantum error correction (QEC) scheme based on a simplified version of Shor's code. Leveraging the specific structure of the QSS protocols, we reduce the qubit overhead from the standard 9 of Shor's code to as few as 3 while still achieving lower average error rates than existing QEC methods. Thus, our approach can also be adopted for other single-qubit-based quantum protocols. Simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the protocols' resilience, improving their practicality for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). To benchmark the method, we simulate random and QAOA circuits with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that TTNs provide a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Beating the break-even point with autonomous quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, as it protects fragile quantum information from errors by encoding it in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Conventional QEC protocols typically require repeated syndrome measurements, real-time feedback, and the use of multiple physical qubits for encoding. Such implementations pose significant technical complexities, particularly for trapped-ion systems, with high demands on precision and scalability. Here, we realize autonomous QEC with a logical qubit encoded in multiple internal spin states of a single trapped ion, surpassing the break-even point for qubit lifetime. Our approach leverages engineered spin-motion couplings to transfer error-induced entropy into motional modes, which are subsequently dissipated through sympathetic cooling with an ancilla ion, fully eliminating the need for measurement and feedback. By repetitively applying this autonomous QEC protocol under injected low-frequency noise, we extend the logical qubit lifetime to approximately 11.6 ms, substantially outperforming lifetime for both the physical qubit ($\simeq$0.9 ms) and the uncorrected logical qubit ($\simeq$0.8 ms), thereby beating the break-even point with autonomous protection of quantum information without measurement or post-selection. This work presents an efficient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing that harnesses the intrinsic multi-level structure of trapped ions, providing a distinctive path toward scalable architectures and robust quantum memories with reduced overhead.</description>

      <title>Real Quantum Mechanics in a Kahler Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the complex Hilbert space and real Kahler space formulations of quantum mechanics.
  Complex numbers play an important role in the traditional formulation of quantum mechanics in complex Hilbert spaces. However, the necessity of complex numbers--as opposed to their mere convenience--remains a subject of debate. Several alternative formulations of quantum mechanics using real numbers have been proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate that standard quantum mechanics, formulated in a complex Hilbert space, admits an equivalent reformulation in a real Kahler space. By establishing a natural isomorphism between the operator theories of the complex Hilbert space and the real Kahler space, we prove the equivalence of the two formulations including composite system.
  This Kahler-space framework preserves all essential features of quantum mechanics while offering a key advantage: it inherently incorporates a Hamiltonian symplectic structure analogous to classical mechanics. This structural alignment provides a unified geometric perspective for both classical and quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the ergodicity of finite-dimensional quantum systems becomes manifest in this framework, resolving interpretational ambiguities present in conventional complex formulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for simulating linear interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent proposals for quantum proof of work protocols, we investigate approaches for simulating linear optical interferometers using digital quantum circuits. We focus on a second quantisation approach, where the quantum computer's registers represent optical modes. We can then use standard quantum optical techniques to decompose the unitary matrix describing an interferometer into an array of $2\times 2$ unitaries, which are subsequently synthesised into quantum circuits and stitched together to complete the circuit. For an $m$ mode interferometer with $n$ identical photons, this method requires approximately $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$ qubits and a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(m n^4 \log_2(n) \: \textrm{polylog}(n^4 / \epsilon))$. We present a software package Aquinas (A QUantum INterferometer ASsembler) that uses this approach to generate such quantum circuits. For reference, an arbitrary five mode interferometer with two identical photons is compiled to a 10 qubit quantum circuit with a depth of 1972.</description>

      <title>The Sponge is Quantum Indifferentiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sponge is a cryptographic construction that turns a public permutation into a hash function. When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge forms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum public-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.
  While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate one is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability. The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.
  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose $O(\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\mathsf{min}(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on preimage and collision resistance that are tighter.</description>

      <title>A first encounter with exceptional points in a quantum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exceptional point is a special point in parameter space at which two (or more) eigenvalues and eigenvectors coincide. The discovery of exceptional points within mechanical and optical systems has uncovered peculiar effects in their vicinity. Here we consider perhaps the simplest quantum model which exhibits an exceptional point and which allows for an analytical treatment. In particular, we re-examine a two-level atom driven by a laser and suffering from losses. The same exceptional point arises in several non-Hermitian matrices which determine various aspects of the dynamics of the system. There are consequences for some important observables, for example the spectrum evolves from being a Lorentzian-like singlet to a Mollow triplet upon passing through the exceptional point. Our analysis supports the perspective that viewing certain quantum systems through the lens of exceptional points offers some desirable explanatory advantages.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Potentiometric detection of spin polarization expected at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in the effective p-wave superconducting state</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, the quest for non-Abelian anyons is attracting tremendous attention. In particular, a Majorana quasiparticle has attracted great interest since the non-Abelian anyon is a key particle for topological quantum computation. Much effort has been paid for the quest of the Majorana state in solids, and some candidate material platforms are reported. Among various materials that can host the Majorana state, chiral p-wave superconductor is one of the suitable materials and the iron-based layered superconductor FeTeSe is one of the promising material platforms because its surface can host effective p-wave superconducting state that is analogous to chiral p-wave superconducting state thanks to its topological surface state. Given that a chiral p-wave superconductor possesses spin polarization, detecting the spin polarization can be evidence for the chiral p-wave trait, which results in the existence of Majorana excitation. Here, we show successful detection of the spin polarization at the surface of FeTe0.6Se0.4 in its superconducting state, where the spin polarization is detected via a potentiometric method. Amplitudes of the spin signal exhibit characteristic dependence for temperature and bias current, suggesting detection of spin polarization of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our achievement opens a new avenue to explore topological superconductivity for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Probing Bulk Band Topology from Time Boundary Effect in Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An incident wave at a temporal interface, created by an abrupt change in system parameters, generates time-refracted and time-reflected waves. We find topological characteristics associated with the temporal interface that separates distinct spatial topologies and report a novel bulk-boundary correspondence for the temporal interface. The vanishing of either time refraction or time reflection records a topological phase transition across the temporal interface, and the difference of bulk band topology predicts nontrivial braiding hidden in the time refraction and time reflection coefficients. These findings, which are insensitive to spatial boundary conditions and robust against disorder, are demonstrated in a synthetic frequency lattice with rich topological phases engendered by long-range couplings.

      <title>Complex tridiagonal quantum Hamiltonians and matrix continued fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonances described by non-Hermitian tridiagonal-matrix Hamiltonians $H$ with complex energy eigenvalues $E_n \in {\mathbb C}$ are considered. The method of evaluation of quantities $\sigma_n=\sqrt{E_n^*E_n}$ known as the singular values of $H$ is proposed. Its basic idea is that the quantities $\sigma_n$ can be treated as square roots of eigenvalues of a certain auxiliary self-adjoint operator $\mathbb{H}$. As long as such an operator can be given a block-tridiagonal matrix form, we construct its resolvent as a matrix continued fraction. In an illustrative application of the formalism, a discrete version of conventional Hamiltonian $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$ with complex local $V(x) \neq V^*(x)$ is considered. The numerical convergence of the recipe is found quick, supported also by a fixed-point-based formal proof.</description>

      <title>Photonic single-arm gravitational wave detectors based on the quantum state transition of orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the quantum state transition of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the present of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate the potential of a new photonic single-arm GW detection technique. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime. It is demonstrated that when a photon possessing OAM of 1 interacts with GWs, it may relinquish its OAM and produce a central signal that may be detected. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in the low-frequency range ($&lt;1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in the mid-frequency range ($1\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary GW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the high-frequency range ($&gt;10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector parameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is proportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors. This technique not only facilitates the extraction of GW information but also creates a new approach for identifying and selecting GW signals.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning Natural and Second Order Gradient Descent in Quantum Optimization: A Performance Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of parametric quantum circuits is technically hindered by three major obstacles: the non-convex nature of the objective function, noisy gradient evaluations, and the presence of barren plateaus. As a result, the selection of classical optimizer becomes a critical factor in assessing and exploiting quantum-classical applications. One promising approach to tackle these challenges involves incorporating curvature information into the parameter update. The most prominent methods in this field are quasi-Newton and quantum natural gradient methods, which can facilitate faster convergence compared to first-order approaches. Second order methods however exhibit a significant trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, as well as heightened sensitivity to noise. This study evaluates the performance of three families of optimizers on synthetically generated MaxCut problems on a shallow QAOA algorithm. To address noise sensitivity and iteration cost, we demonstrate that incorporating secant-penalization in the BFGS update rule (SP-BFGS) yields improved outcomes for QAOA optimization problems, introducing a novel approach to stabilizing BFGS updates against gradient noise.</description>

      <title>Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch &amp; Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &amp; bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &amp; bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch &amp; bound formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in the future.</description>

      <title>More on genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16589v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the construction of genuine multi-entropy ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for genuine multi-partite entanglement proposed in the previous paper arXiv:2502.07995, we give a prescription on how to construct ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ systematically for any $\mathtt{q}$. The crucial point is that our construction naturally fits to the partition number $p(\mathtt{a})$ of integer $\mathtt{a}$. For general $\mathtt{q}$, ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ contains $N (\mathtt{q}) = p(\mathtt{q})-p(\mathtt{q}-1)-1$ number of free parameters. Furthermore, these give $N (\mathtt{q})+1$ number of new diagnostics for genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement. Especially for $\mathtt{q}=4$ case, this reproduces not only the known diagnostics pointed out by arXiv:1406.2663, but also a new diagnostics for quadripartite entanglement. We also study these ${\rm GM}[\mathtt{q}]$ for $\mathtt{q} = 4, 5$ in holography and show that these are of the order of ${\cal{O}}\left(1/G_N \right)$ both analytically and numerically. Our results give evidence that genuine multipartite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography. We discuss the connection to quantum error correction and the role of genuine multipartite entanglement in bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Rotating effects on the Hall conductivity in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the quantized Hall conductivity in a two-dimensional quantum system under rotating effects, a uniform magnetic field, and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux tube. By varying the angular velocity and the AB flux, we analyze their impact on the formation, shifting, and structure of quantized Hall plateaus. Our results reveal that rotation modifies the energy spectrum, leading to slight shifts in the plateau positions and variations in their widths. Additionally, we identify Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations in $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$, which become more pronounced for lower values of the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, indicating enhanced quantum interference effects in the low-field regime. These oscillations are further modulated by $\Omega$, affecting their periodicity and amplitude. The interplay between the confinement frequency $\omega_0$, the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, and the rotational effects plays a crucial role in determining the overall behavior of $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between rotation, magnetic field, and quantum interference effects, which are relevant for experimental investigations of quantum Hall systems in rotating systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.</description>

      <title>Improving the efficiency of learning-based error mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error mitigation will play an important role in practical applications of near-term noisy quantum computers. Current error mitigation methods typically concentrate on correction quality at the expense of frugality (as measured by the number of additional calls to quantum hardware). To fill the need for highly accurate, yet inexpensive techniques, we introduce an error mitigation scheme that builds on Clifford data regression (CDR). The scheme improves the frugality by carefully choosing the training data and exploiting the symmetries of the problem. We test our approach by correcting long range correlators of the ground state of XY Hamiltonian on IBM Toronto quantum computer. We find that our method is an order of magnitude cheaper while maintaining the same accuracy as the original CDR approach. The efficiency gain enables us to obtain a factor of $10$ improvement on the unmitigated results with the total budget as small as $2\cdot10^5$ shots. Furthermore, we demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in frugality for mitigation of energy of the LiH ground state simulated with IBM's Ourense-derived noise model.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Equipartition Theorems in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) in information theory establishes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states behave in a way that is similar to uniform states. In particular, with appropriate smoothing, for such states both the min and the max relative entropy asymptotically coincide with the relative entropy. In this paper, we generalize several such equipartition properties to states on general von Neumann algebras.
  First, we show that the smooth max relative entropy of i.i.d. states on a von Neumann algebra has an asymptotic rate given by the quantum relative entropy. In fact, our AEP not only applies to states, but also to quantum channels with appropriate restrictions. In addition, going beyond the i.i.d. assumption, we show that for states that are produced by a sequential process of quantum channels, the smooth max relative entropy can be upper bounded by the sum of appropriate channel relative entropies.
  Our main technical contributions are to extend to the context of general von Neumann algebras a chain rule for quantum channels, as well as an additivity result for the channel relative entropy with a replacer channel.</description>

Abstract: The search task is one of the most difficult when it comes to execution speed, and reducing the latter is important both when working with large data and with small samples, if they need to be processed frequently and in a limited time. Grover's algorithm gave hope to quantum computing and served as an excellent base for all possible implementations and modifications. In this paper, we propose a slightly different algorithm that increases the probability of finding the nearest value by reducing the probability of undesirable values in a controlled manner (in proportion to their difference from the desired value), as well as implementing an oracle that requires a single call without an additional ancilla qubit to redistribute the amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Superadditive Communication with the Green Machine: A Practical Demonstration of Nonlocality without Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving the ultimate Holevo limit of optical communication capacity requires a joint-detection receiver which makes a collective quantum measurement over multiple modulated symbols. Such superadditivity -- a higher communication rate than that achievable by symbol-by-symbol optical detection -- is a special case of the well-known nonlocality without entanglement and has yet to be demonstrated. In this article, we propose and demonstrate a design of joint-detection receivers, the Green Machine, that can achieve superadditivity. We build this receiver and show that its capacity surpasses any symbol-by-symbol receivers in the photon-starved regime with binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK). Our Green Machine receiver can also significantly reduce the transmitter peak power requirement compared with the pulse-position modulation (the conventional modulation format used for deep space laser communication). We further show that the self-referenced phase makes it immune to phase noise, e.g., atmospheric turbulence or platform vibrations.</description>

      <title>Improved performance of the Bacon-Shor code with Steane's syndrome extraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare Steane's and Shor's syndrome extraction methods on the Bacon-Shor code. We propose a straightforward strategy based on post-selection to prepare the logical $|0\rangle_L$ and $|+\rangle_L$ states of the Bacon-Shor code by using flag-like qubits to verify their constituent Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. We perform stabilizer simulations with a depolarizing Pauli error model and find that Steane's method significantly outperforms Shor's. Not only does Steane's method result in pseudo-thresholds that are about 1 order of magnitude higher than Shor's, but also its advantage increases monotonically as we go from a distance-3 to a distance-9 Bacon-Shor code. The advantage of Steane's method is the greatest in the regime where gate errors dominate over measurement errors. Some of the circuit constructions we propose for Steane's method are not formally fault-tolerant, yet outperform the formally fault-tolerant Shor's protocols for experimentally relevant physical error rates. This suggest that constructing formally fault-tolerant circuits that maintain the full code distance is not strictly necessary to guarantee the usefulness of a quantum error-correcting protocol. Despite relying on post-selection, we find that our methods can be efficient. These protocols would be naturally implementable on a platform with long-range qubit interactions like trapped ions or neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum oscillator interacting and back-reacting on a classical oscillator. This can be done consistently provided the quantum system decoheres, while the backreaction has a stochastic component which causes the classical system to undergo diffusion. Nonetheless the state of the quantum oscillator can remain pure conditioned on the trajectory of the classical oscillator. We solve the system using the classical-quantum path integral formulation, and investigate slow moving regimes of either the classical or quantum oscillator. Lastly, we study the correlators of this classicalquantum setup. We are able to identify the free correlators of the theory and compute the full partition function perturbatively up to second order. This serves as a toy model for a number of other systems in which one system can be treated as effectively classical, such as a scalar quantum field interacting with another field undergoing decoherence, or a system emitting radiation, one of which is treated classically.</description>

Abstract: Investigating causation in the quantum domain is crucial. Despite numerous studies of correlations in quantum many-body systems, causation, which is very distinct from correlations, has hardly been studied. We address this by demonstrating the efficacy of the newly established causation measure, quantum Liang information flow, in quantifying causality across phase diagrams of quantum many-body systems. We focus on quantum criticality, which are highly nonclassical points. We extract causation behavior across a spectrum-wide critical point and a ground state second-order phase transition in both integrable and nonintegrable systems. Across criticality, each case exhibits distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. We also deduce that quantum causation qualitatively follows the quasiparticle picture of information propagation in integrable systems but exhibits enhanced quantum nonlocality near criticality. At times significantly larger than the spatial separation, it extracts additional features from the equilibrium wave function, leading to a peak just before the critical point for near boundary sites.</description>

      <title>A robust and composable device-independent protocol for oblivious transfer using (fully) untrusted quantum devices in the bounded storage model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust and composable device-independent (DI) quantum protocol between two parties for oblivious transfer (OT) using Magic Square devices in the bounded storage model in which the (honest and cheating) devices and parties have no long-term quantum memory. After a fixed constant (real-world) time interval, referred to as DELAY, the quantum states decohere completely. The adversary (cheating party), with full control over the devices, is allowed joint (non-IID) quantum operations on the devices, and there are no time and space complexity bounds placed on its powers. The running time of the honest parties is polylog({\lambda}) (where {\lambda} is the security parameter). Our protocol has negligible (in {\lambda}) correctness and security errors and can be implemented in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era. By robustness, we mean that our protocol is correct even when devices are slightly off (by a small constant) from their ideal specification. This is an important property since small manufacturing errors in the real-world devices are inevitable. Our protocol is sequentially composable and, hence, can be used as a building block to construct larger protocols (including DI bit-commitment and DI secure multi-party computation) while still preserving correctness and security guarantees.
  None of the known DI protocols for OT in the literature are robust and secure against joint quantum attacks. This was a major open question in device-independent two-party distrustful cryptography, which we resolve.
  We prove a parallel repetition theorem for a certain class of entangled games with a hybrid (quantum-classical) strategy to show the security of our protocol. The hybrid strategy helps to incorporate DELAY in our protocol. This parallel repetition theorem is a main technical contribution of our work.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phases exhibit unconventional dynamics as emergent collective phenomena, yet their behavior in tailored interacting systems -- crucial for quantum technologies -- remains less understood. We develop a systematic toolbox to analyze monitored dynamics in long-range interacting systems, relevant to platforms like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms. Our method extends spin-wave theory to general dynamical generators at the quantum trajectory level, enabling access to a broader class of states than approaches based on density matrices. This allows efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins and captures nonlinear dynamical features such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring entanglement phase transitions in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions in one and two dimensions, where the entanglement scaling changes from logarithm to volume law as the interaction range shortens, and by dwelling on how our method mitigates experimental post-selection challenges in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a critical role in preventing information loss in quantum systems and provides a framework for reliable quantum computation. Identifying quantum codes with nice code parameters for physically motivated noise models remains an interesting challenge. While past work has primarily focused on qubit codes, here we identify a $[4,1]$ qudit error correcting code tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. We show that this four-qudit code satisfies the error correction conditions for all single-qudit and a few two-qudit damping errors up to the leading order in the damping parameter $\gamma$. We devise a protocol to extract syndromes that unambiguously identify this set of errors, leading to a noise-adapted recovery scheme that achieves a fidelity loss of $\mathcal{O}(\gamma^{2})$. For the $d=2$ case, our QEC scheme is identical to the known example of the $4$-qubit code and the associated syndrome-based recovery. We also assess the performance of this code using the Petz recovery map and note some interesting deviations from the qubit case. Finally, we generalize this construction to a family of $[2M+2, M]$ qudit codes that can approximately correct all the single-qudit and a few two-qudit amplitude-damping errors.</description>

Abstract: We study the estimation of relative entropy $D(\rho\|\sigma)$ when $\sigma$ is known. We show that the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound equals the relative varentropy. Our estimator attains the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound when the dimension $d$ is fixed. It also achieves the sample complexity $O(d^2)$ when the dimension $d$ increases. This sample complexity is optimal when $\sigma$ is the completely mixed state. Also, it has time complexity $O(d^6 \polylog d)$. Our proposed estimator unifiedly works under both settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One significant advantage of superconducting processors is their extensive design flexibility, which encompasses various types of qubits and interactions. Given the large number of tunable parameters of a processor, the ability to perform gradient optimization would be highly beneficial. Efficient backpropagation for gradient computation requires a tightly integrated software library, for which no open-source implementation is currently available. In this work, we introduce SuperGrad, a simulator that accelerates the design of superconducting quantum processors by incorporating gradient computation capabilities. SuperGrad offers a user-friendly interface for constructing Hamiltonians and computing both static and dynamic properties of composite systems. This differentiable simulation is valuable for a range of applications, including optimal control, design optimization, and experimental data fitting. In this paper, we demonstrate these applications through examples and code snippets.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol that maximizes unconditional entanglement generation between two masses interacting directly through $1/r^{n}$ potential. The protocol combines optimal quantum control of continuously measured masses with their non-equilibrium dynamics, driven by a time-dependent interaction strength. Applied to a pair of optically trapped sub-micron particles coupled via electrostatic interaction, our protocol enables unconditional entanglement generation at the fundamental limit of the conditional state and with an order of magnitude smaller interaction between the masses compared to the existing steady-state approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a feedback strategy based on optimal quantum feedback control for Gaussian systems to maximise the likelihood of steady-state entanglement detection between two directly interacting masses. We employ linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control to engineer the phase space dynamics of the two masses and propose Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type variance minimisation constraints for the feedback to facilitate unconditional entanglement generation. This scheme allows for stationary entanglement in parameter regimes where strategies based on total energy minimisation ($cooling$) would fail. This feedback strategy, applied to the system of two masses driven out-of-thermal equilibrium [arXiv:2408.06251] enables unconditional entanglement generation under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

Abstract: Building on the insight that engineered noise, specifically, engineered dephasing can enhance the adiabaticity of controlled quantum dynamics, we investigate how a dephasing-generating coupling to an auxiliary quantum system affects quantum annealing protocols. By calculating the exact reduced system dynamics, we show how this coupling enhances the system's adiabaticity solely through a coherent mechanism - an effective energy rescaling. We show that it can lead to an annealing speedup linearly proportional to the strength of the coupling. We discuss the experimental feasibility of the protocols, and investigate the trade-off between fidelity and implementability by examining two modified versions with fewer types of required physical couplings.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).</description>

Abstract: Theory and experiment have long discussed negative thermodynamic pressure states, but their microscopic origins are unclear. I address this problem within the framework of quantum thermodynamics. I show that the pressure exerted on the boundary is positive when there is no interaction with the boundary. This is formalized by a no-go theorem that holds for any quantum state with finite motion. As a consequence of this analysis, I deduce a general formula for quantum non-equilibrium pressure. It is believed that stable negative pressure states cannot exist in gases. I provide solvable examples of quantum and classical gases, where negative pressure is achieved due to a suitable coupling with the boundary walls.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational complexity of matrix functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dividing line between classical and quantum computational power in estimating properties of matrix functions. More precisely, we study the computational complexity of two primitive problems: given a function $f$ and a Hermitian matrix $A$, compute a matrix element of $f(A)$ or compute a local measurement on $f(A)|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$, with $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ an $n$-qubit reference state vector, in both cases up to additive approximation error. We consider four functions -- monomials, Chebyshev polynomials, the time evolution function, and the inverse function -- and probe the complexity across a broad landscape covering different problem input regimes. Namely, we consider two types of matrix inputs (sparse and Pauli access), matrix properties (norm, sparsity), the approximation error, and function-specific parameters. We identify BQP-complete forms of both problems for each function and then toggle the problem parameters to easier regimes to see where hardness remains, or where the problem becomes classically easy. As part of our results, we make concrete a hierarchy of hardness across the functions; in parameter regimes where we have classically efficient algorithms for monomials, all three other functions remain robustly BQP-hard, or hard under usual computational complexity assumptions. In identifying classically easy regimes, among others, we show that for any polynomial of degree $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ both problems can be efficiently classically simulated when $A$ has $O(\log n)$ non-zero coefficients in the Pauli basis. This contrasts with the fact that the problems are BQP-complete in the sparse access model even for constant row sparsity, whereas the stated Pauli access efficiently constructs sparse access with row sparsity $O(\log n)$. Our work provides a catalog of efficient quantum and classical algorithms for fundamental linear-algebra tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics governs the transformation of static quantum resources, such as coherence and entanglement, in both quantum states and measurements. Prior studies have established that a quantum channel's state-cohering power can be converted into state-entangling power without additional coherence. Here, we complete this coherence-to-entanglement paradigm by demonstrating that a channel's measurement-cohering power can likewise be converted into measurement-entangling power. This result reinforces, on the dynamical level, the intuition that entanglement emerges as a manifestation of coherence. To formalize this picture, we develop resource theories for measurement-cohering and measurement-entangling powers and characterize the structure of incoherent measurements to analyze measurement-coherence generation. Furthermore, we show that the state-cohering power of a quantum channel is equivalent to the measurement-cohering power of its adjoint map, and a corresponding equivalence also exists between state-entangling power and measurement-entangling power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A catalyst is a substance that enables otherwise impossible transformations between states of a system, without being consumed in the process. In this work, we apply the notion of catalysts to many-body quantum physics. In particular, we construct catalysts that enable transformations between different symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter using symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits. We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states which spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework which has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pure- and mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.</description>

Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the achievement of single-qubit gates with sub-part-per-million error rates, in a trapped-ion $^{43}$Ca$^{+}$ hyperfine clock qubit. We explore the speed/fidelity trade-off for gate times $4.4\leq t_{g}\leq35~\mu$s, and benchmark a minimum error per Clifford gate of $1.5(4) \times 10^{-7}$. Calibration errors are suppressed to $&lt; 10^{-8}$, leaving qubit decoherence ($T_{2}\approx 70$ s), leakage, and measurement as the dominant error contributions. The ion is held above a microfabricated surface-electrode trap which incorporates a chip-integrated microwave resonator for electronic qubit control; the trap is operated at room temperature without magnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Four-body coupler for superconducting qubits based on Josephson parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a circuit of the four-body coupler for superconducting qubits based on Josephson parametric oscillators (JPOs). Our coupler for the four-body interaction has a superconducting loop, similar to a capacitively shunted flux qubit, where an external magnetic flux set to half a flux quantum is threaded. This coupler circuit is a specific setup of the circuit called superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAIL) and also is a generalization of the previously proposed one for the four-body interaction of JPOs. We clarify roles of circuit parameters in the four-body interaction and, in particular, show that the four-body coupling constant in our circuit can be significantly increased by tuning capacitance of the coupler or the area ratio of the Josephson junctions of the coupler.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a trapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating data qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the metastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable state without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both methods on a crystal of two $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$ ground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit. These MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\%$ without degrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser noise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\%$. The demonstrated method allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without shuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum algorithms combine the strengths of quantum and classical computing. Many quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), leverage this synergy. However, quantum circuits are executed in full, even when only subsets of measurement outcomes contribute to subsequent classical computations. In this manuscript, we propose a novel circuit optimization technique that identifies and removes dead gates. We prove that the removal of dead gates has no influence on the probability distribution of the measurement outcomes that contribute to the subsequent calculation result. We implemented and evaluated our optimization on a VQE instance, a quantum phase estimation (QPE) instance, and hybrid programs embedded with random circuits of varying circuit width, confirming its capability to remove a non-trivial number of dead gates in real-world algorithms. The effect of our optimization scales up as more measurement outcomes are identified as non-contributory, resulting in a proportionally greater reduction of dead gates.</description>

      <title>Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</description>

      <title>Verifiable End-to-End Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving complex optimization and machine learning tasks on near-term quantum hardware. However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Daniel McNulty et.al (2024 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. submitted) voiced suspicions to the Lemma 11(v) Part 6 in Chen and Yu (2017 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50 475304) and three theorems derived in later publications (Liang et al 2019 Quantum Inf. Process. 18 352; Liang et al 2019 Linear Multilinear Algebra 69 2908-25; Chen et al 2021 Quantum Inf. Process. 20 353). For these suspicions, we reprove that any complex Hadamard matrix of order-six whose number of real elements more than 22 does not belong to a set of four mutually unbiased bases. We show that the number of complex Hadamard submatrices of order-two of any H2-reducible matrix is not 10,...,16,18. We also put forward some possible directions for further development.</description>

      <title>An Error Mitigated Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver via Shadow Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a shadow-tomography-enhanced Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver (NOQE) for more efficient and accurate electronic structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. By integrating shadow tomography into the NOQE, the measurement cost scales linearly rather than quadratically with the number of reference states, while also reducing the required qubits and circuit depth by half. This approach enables extraction of all matrix elements via randomized measurements and classical postprocessing. We analyze its sample complexity and show that, for small systems, it remains constant in the high-precision regime, while for larger systems, it scales linearly with the system size. We further apply shadow-based error mitigation to suppress noise-induced bias without increasing quantum resources. Demonstrations on the hydrogen molecule in the strongly correlated regime achieve chemical accuracy under realistic noise, showing that our method is both resource-efficient and noise-resilient for practical quantum chemistry simulations in the near term.</description>

      <title>The Mutual Information In The Vicinity of Capacity-Achieving Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14219v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mutual information is bounded from above by a decreasing affine function of the square of the distance between the input distribution and the set of all capacity-achieving input distributions $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, on small enough neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, using an identity due to Tops{\o}e and the Pinsker's inequality, assuming that the input set of the channel is finite and the constraint set $\mathcal{A}$ is polyhedral, i.e., can be described by (possibly multiple but) finitely many linear constraints. Counterexamples demonstrating nonexistence of such a quadratic bound are provided for the case of infinitely many linear constraints and the case of infinite input sets. Using Taylor's theorem with the remainder term, rather than the Pinsker's inequality and invoking Moreau's decomposition theorem the exact characterization of the slowest decrease of the mutual information with the distance to $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$ is determined on small neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$. Corresponding results for classical-quantum channels are established under separable output Hilbert space assumption for the quadratic bound and under finite-dimensional output Hilbert space assumption for the exact characterization. Implications of these observations for the channel coding problem and applications of the proof techniques to related problems are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of density-functional theory for quantum-electrodynamical model systems is provided. In particular, the quantum Rabi model, the Dicke model, and a generalization of the latter to multiple modes are considered. We prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that manifests the magnetization and displacement as internal variables, along with several representability results. The constrained-search functionals for pure states and ensembles are introduced and analyzed. We find the optimizers for the pure-state constrained-search functional to be low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and, based on the properties of the optimizers, we formulate an adiabatic-connection formula. In the reduced case of the Rabi model we can even show differentiability of the universal density functional, which amounts to unique pure-state v-representability.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</title>

Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and, at the same time, constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Qiskit Quantum Circuits Posit Singlet state in Radical Pair-based Magnetoreception of Migratory Birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications in diverse domains are emerging rapidly. Given the limitations of classical computing techniques, the peculiarity of quantum circuits, which can observe quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, is remarkable. This capability enables them to achieve measurement sensitivities far beyond classical limits. Research on radical pair-based magnetoreception in migratory birds has been a focus area for quite some time. A quantum mechanics-based computing approach, thus unsurprisingly, identifies a scope of application. In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species. The four-qubit model emulating electron-nucleus systems mimicking the environmental complexity outcome shows the sensitiveness to change of magnetic flux index, high probability of singlet-triplet dynamics, and upholding radical pair model states by the purity of the sub-system and full system outcome of coherence, the hallmark of singlet state dominance. The work involved performing fifty quantum circuits for different magnetic field values, each with one thousand and twenty-four shots for measurement, either in the simulator or on real quantum hardware, and for two error mitigation techniques, preceded by a noise model of a simulator run.</description>

      <title>Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>
