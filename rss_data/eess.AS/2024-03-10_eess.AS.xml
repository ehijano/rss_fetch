      <title>(Un)paired signal-to-signal translation with 1D conditional GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that a one-dimensional (1D) conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with an adversarial training architecture is capable of unpaired signal-to-signal ("sig2sig") translation. Using a simplified CycleGAN model with 1D layers and wider convolutional kernels, mirroring WaveGAN to reframe two-dimensional (2D) image generation as 1D audio generation, I show that recasting the 2D image-to-image translation task to a 1D signal-to-signal translation task with deep convolutional GANs is possible without substantial modification to the conventional U-Net model and adversarial architecture developed as CycleGAN. With this I show for a small tunable dataset that noisy test signals unseen by the 1D CycleGAN model and without paired training transform from the source domain to signals similar to paired test signals in the translated domain, especially in terms of frequency, and I quantify these differences in terms of correlation and error.</description>

      <title>AttentionStitch: How Attention Solves the Speech Editing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of natural and high-quality speech from text is a challenging problem in the field of natural language processing. In addition to speech generation, speech editing is also a crucial task, which requires the seamless and unnoticeable integration of edited speech into synthesized speech. We propose a novel approach to speech editing by leveraging a pre-trained text-to-speech (TTS) model, such as FastSpeech 2, and incorporating a double attention block network on top of it to automatically merge the synthesized mel-spectrogram with the mel-spectrogram of the edited text. We refer to this model as AttentionStitch, as it harnesses attention to stitch audio samples together. We evaluate the proposed AttentionStitch model against state-of-the-art baselines on both single and multi-speaker datasets, namely LJSpeech and VCTK. We demonstrate its superior performance through an objective and a subjective evaluation test involving 15 human participants. AttentionStitch is capable of producing high-quality speech, even for words not seen during training, while operating automatically without the need for human intervention. Moreover, AttentionStitch is fast during both training and inference and is able to generate human-sounding edited speech.</description>

      <title>Robust Semantic Communications for Speech-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust semantic communication system to achieve the speech-to-text translation task, named Ross-S2T, by delivering the essential semantic information. Particularly, a deep semantic encoder is developed to directly condense and convert the speech in the source language to the textual semantic features associated with the target language, thus encouraging the design of a deep learning-enabled semantic communication system for speech-to-text translation that can be jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, to cope with the practical communication scenario when the input speech is corrupted, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-enabled deep semantic compensator is proposed to predict the lost semantic information in the source speech and produce the textual semantic features in the target language simultaneously, which establishes a robust semantic transmission mechanism for dynamic speech input. According to the simulation results, the proposed Ross-S2T achieves significant speech-to-text translation performance compared to the conventional approach and exhibits high robustness against the corrupted speech input.</description>

      <title>Binaural Speech Enhancement Using Deep Complex Convolutional Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies have shown that in noisy acoustic environments, providing binaural signals to the user of an assistive listening device may improve speech intelligibility and spatial awareness. This paper presents a binaural speech enhancement method using a complex convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture and a complex multi-head attention transformer. The model is trained to estimate individual complex ratio masks in the time-frequency domain for the left and right-ear channels of binaural hearing devices. The model is trained using a novel loss function that incorporates the preservation of spatial information along with speech intelligibility improvement and noise reduction. Simulation results for acoustic scenarios with a single target speaker and isotropic noise of various types show that the proposed method improves the estimated binaural speech intelligibility and preserves the binaural cues better in comparison with several baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>RFWave: Multi-band Rectified Flow for Audio Waveform Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling have led to significant progress in audio waveform reconstruction from diverse representations. Although diffusion models have been used for reconstructing audio waveforms, they tend to exhibit latency issues because they operate at the level of individual sample points and require a relatively large number of sampling steps. In this study, we introduce RFWave, a novel multi-band Rectified Flow approach that reconstructs high-fidelity audio waveforms from Mel-spectrograms. RFWave is distinctive for generating complex spectrograms and operating at the frame level, processing all subbands concurrently to enhance efficiency. Thanks to Rectified Flow, which aims for a flat transport trajectory, RFWave requires only 10 sampling steps. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RFWave achieves exceptional reconstruction quality and superior computational efficiency, capable of generating audio at a speed 90 times faster than real-time.</description>

      <title>Spectrogram-Based Detection of Auto-Tuned Vocals in Music Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of music production and audio processing, the implementation of automatic pitch correction of the singing voice, also known as Auto-Tune, has significantly transformed the landscape of vocal performance. While auto-tuning technology has offered musicians the ability to tune their vocal pitches and achieve a desired level of precision, its use has also sparked debates regarding its impact on authenticity and artistic integrity. As a result, detecting and analyzing Auto-Tuned vocals in music recordings has become essential for music scholars, producers, and listeners. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior effort has been made in this direction. This study introduces a data-driven approach leveraging triplet networks for the detection of Auto-Tuned songs, backed by the creation of a dataset composed of original and Auto-Tuned audio clips. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both accuracy and robustness compared to Rawnet2, an end-to-end model proposed for anti-spoofing and widely used for other audio forensic tasks.</description>
