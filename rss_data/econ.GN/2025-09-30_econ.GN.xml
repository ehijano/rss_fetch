      <title>Private and public school efficiency gaps in Latin America-A combined DEA and machine learning approach based on PISA 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latin America's education systems are fragmented and segregated, with substantial differences by school type. The concept of school efficiency (the ability of school to produce the maximum level of outputs given available resources) is policy relevant due to scarcity of resources in the region. Knowing whether private and public schools are making an efficient use of resources -and which are the leading drivers of efficiency- is critical, even more so after the learning crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, relying on data of 2,034 schools and nine Latin American countries from PISA 2022, I offer new evidence on school efficiency (both on cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by school type and, then, I estimate efficiency leading determinants through interpretable machine learning methods (IML). This hybrid DEA-IML approach allows to accommodate the issue of big data (jointly assessing several determinants of school efficiency). I find a cognitive efficiency gap of nearly 0.10 favouring private schools and of 0.045 for non-cognitive outcomes, and with a lower heterogeneity in private than public schools. For cognitive efficiency, leading determinants for the chance of a private school of being highly efficient are higher stock of books and PCs at home, lack of engagement in paid work and school's high autonomy; whereas low-efficient public schools are shaped by poor school climate, large rates of repetition, truancy and intensity of paid work, few books at home and increasing barriers for homework during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>The AI Productivity Index (APEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking = On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of models' ability to produce economically valuable work.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Multiple Environmental Markets: Addressing Contamination Bias in Overlapping Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the dual environmental challenges of pollution and climate change, China has established multiple environmental markets, including pollution emissions trading, carbon emissions trading, energy-use rights trading, and green electricity trading. Previous empirical studies suffer from known biases arising from time-varying treatment and multiple treatments. To address these limitations, this study adopts a dynamic control group design and combines Difference-in-Difference (DiD) and Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) empirical strategies. Using panel data on A-share listed companies from 2000 to 2024, this study investigates the marginal effects and interactive impacts of multiple environmental markets implemented in staggered and overlapping phases. Existing pollution emissions trading mitigates the negative effects of carbon emission trading. Carbon trading suppresses (improves) financial performance (if implemented alongside energy-use rights trading). The addition of energy-use rights or green electricity trading in regions already covered by carbon or pollution markets has no significant effects.</description>

      <title>"Rich-Get-Richer"? Analyzing Content Creator Earnings Across Large Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth, rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Bidding strategies for energy storage players in 100% renewable electricity market: A game-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electricity systems powered entirely by renewable energy sources makes energy storage indispensable for balancing intermittency and ensuring reliability. Since RES operate at near-zero marginal cost, storage operators can strongly influence electricity prices and energy security when renewable supply alone cannot meet demand. We develop a Cournot competition model in which storage operators strategically bid quantities to maximize their profits. We propose a MILP model with the big-M method and reformulation using continuous variables, incorporating demand blocks. The strategic bidding game is solved using the diagonalization algorithm, and the social planner's problem is used for benchmarking, cast as a one-shot optimization. The proposed model is applied to Denmark's power system using current data and 2030 renewable projections, capturing both current and future market conditions. Results show that storage operators affect market performance by arbitrage between low-and high-price periods, which can smooth supply-demand imbalances, thereby improving welfare relative to the no-storage case. With limited competition, however, strategic withholding increases prices and reduces welfare, while expanding storage capacity beyond a certain point yields no further gains. As the number of firms increases, competition mitigates distortions, and outcomes converge toward the social planner's benchmark with only two to three strategic players. These findings highlight storage's dual role in both stabilizing markets and creating market power. underscoring the need for market designs that align operators' incentives with social welfare.</description>

      <title>Technology innovation in evolutionary green transition: environmental quality and economic sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an evolutionary model to study the transition toward green technology under the influence of innovation. Clean and dirty technologies are selected according to their profitability under an environmental tax, which depends on the overall pollution level. Pollution itself evolves dynamically: it results from the emissions of the two types of producers, naturally decays, and is reduced through the implementation of the current abatement technology. The regulator collects tax revenues and allocates them between the implementation of the existing abatement technology and its innovation, which increases the stock of knowledge and thereby enhances abatement effectiveness. From a static perspective, we show the existence of steady states, both with homogeneous populations of clean or dirty producers and with heterogeneous populations where both technologies coexist. We discuss the mechanisms through which these steady states emerge and how they may evolve into one another. From a dynamical perspective, we characterize the resulting scenarios, showing how innovation can foster a green transition if coupled with a suitable level of taxation. At the same time, we investigate how improper environmental policies may also produce unintended outcomes, such as environmental deterioration, reversion to dirty technology, or economic unsustainability.</description>

      <title>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding interregional transmission is widely viewed as essential for integrating clean energy into decarbonized power systems. Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.</description>

      <title>Pooling Liquidity Pools in AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market fragmentation across multiple Automated Market Makers (AMMs) creates inefficiencies such as costly arbitrage, unnecessarily high slippage and delayed incorporation of new information into prices. These inefficiencies raise trading costs, reduce liquidity provider profits, and degrade overall market efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a modification of the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) pricing mechanism, called the Global Market Maker (GMM), which aggregates liquidity information from all AMMs to mitigate these inefficiencies. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the GMM enhances profits for both AMMs and traders by eliminating arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, it reduces the profitability of sandwich attacks and minimizes impermanent losses.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18829v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic development, economic geography, and innovation. Yet, despite their widespread adoption, we lack a mechanistic model that provides these methods with a solid mathematical foundation. Here, we analytically derive the economic complexity eigenvector associated with a mechanistic model where the output of an economy in an activity (e.g. of a country in a product) depends on the combined presence of the factors required by the activity. Using analytical and numerical derivations we show that the economic complexity index (or ECI) is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with many factors, validating the idea that it is an agnostic estimate of the presence of multiple factors of production. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption, showing that the derived wage function is consistent with economies converging to an income that is compatible with their complexity. Finally, we use this model to explain differences in the networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space, showing that the shape of these networks can be explained by different factor distributions. These findings solve long standing puzzles in the economic complexity literature and validate commonly used metrics of economic complexity as estimates of the combined presence of multiple factors.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>
