      <title>Reconstructing inflationary potential from NANOGrav 15-year Data: A robust study using Non-Bunch Davies initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the theoretical framework behind reconstruction of a generic class of inflationary potentials for canonical single-field slow-roll inflation in a model-independent fashion. The Non-Bunch Davies (NBD) initial condition is an essential choice to determine the structure of potential and to accommodate the blue-tilted tensor power spectrum feature recently observed in NANOGrav. Using the reconstruction technique we found the favoured parameter space which supports blue tilted tensor power spectrum. The validity of the EFT prescription in inflation is also maintained through the use of a new field excursion formula while keeping the necessary and sufficient conditions on the sub-Planckian field values in check. We find that the reconstructed potential display inflection point behaviour, which has deeper connection with high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Comment on the article "Non-local gravitational corrections in black hole shadow images" by S. O. Alexeyev et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Alexeyev et al. published paper (J. Theor. Exper. Phys. v. 165, N 4, p. 508 in Russian; arXiv:2404.16079 [gr-qc], the reference is given also in [1]). In the paper the authors discussed an opportunity of estimating spins from the analysis of the shadow reconstruction of black holes, theoretically considered using the nonlocal gravity model proposed earlier for the description of "quantum" black holes. However, in essence, this paper considered circular photon orbits, and the fact that the corresponding motion parameters determine the shape and size of shadows, similarly to Kerr black holes, remained unproven. It is also remained unproven the statement that for an equatorial observer the shadow size in the direction of rotation of quantum black holes remains independent of spin. A long time ago the shadow property was established for the Kerr black hole case.</description>

      <title>Exploring a novel Einstein--Rosen BTZ wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Einstein-Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</description>

      <title>Stationary BTZ space-time in Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that ``Ricci-inverse" refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the function $f$ is defined by $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, with $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this novel gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum, $M \neq 0, J\neq 0$, (ii) massless $M=0$ and $J=0$, and (iii) $M=-1, J=0$, that is $AdS_3$-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.</description>

      <title>Fake Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Whether a fake Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole can be realized under the dominant energy condition is an open question.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>A third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes and a quasi-local mass-charge inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a third law of black hole mechanics does not hold for Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a massless charged scalar field: there exist solutions that describe gravitational collapse to form an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in finite time. In this paper it is proved that such solutions do not exist in theories with matter fields satisfying a local mass-charge inequality. In such a theory, if a 2-surface has the same metric, extrinsic curvature, and Maxwell field as a cross-section of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om horizon then this surface cannot have a compact interior and so cannot be a horizon cross-section of a black hole formed in gravitational collapse. This result is proved using spinorial techniques, which are also used to prove a mass-charge inequality for a modified version of the Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the universe with quintessence model in Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universe's evolution within the framework of Rastall gravity, which is an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Utilizing a linear parametrization of the Equation of State (EoS) in a Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, we constrain the model parameters through analysis of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, Gold, Gamma Ray Burst (GRB), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets, as well as their joint analysis, under $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence levels, considering the Rastall parameter $\lambda$. The constrained parameters are then used to compare our model with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings include a detailed examination of the model's physical interpretations and demonstrate the potential for an accelerating universe expansion in later times, aligning with the observed behavior of dark energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational signatures of a static nonlinear electromagnetic extension of the Kerr-Newman solution. We conduct an analysis of light propagation, focusing on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and geodesic trajectories in this spacetime. The deflection angle and the time delay effects are also considered. In the thermodynamic analysis, we examine the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and the emission of Hawking radiation via the tunneling process. The remnant mass and evaporation time of the black hole at its final stage are estimated. Lastly, we calculate the quasinormal modes using the WKB approximation to capture the characteristic oscillations of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the ADM mass of the time slices of $(n + 1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. This extends the Minkowski inequality for static vacuum spacetimes, which relates the total mass of a time slice to the area and total mean curvature of its boundary. As a corollary, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions and with rigidity for static manifolds under the TCC.</description>

      <title>Do maximally entangled states always have an advantage over non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is greater than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states under a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study quantum entanglement for four different types of Bell-like states of the fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. It is interesting to find that quantum entanglement in the maximally entangled states is less than quantum entanglement in the non-maximally entangled states in Schwarzschild spacetime. From the perspective of quantum resources, the non-maximally entangled states may have more advantages in curved spacetime compared to the maximally entangled states. This is obviously different from the conclusions in previous paper. For two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement suffers sudden death under the Hawking effect of the black hole, and for the other two types of Bell-like states, quantum entanglement can exist forever regardless of the Hawking temperature. Therefore, we should choose appropriate types of Bell-like states to handle relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Warm non-minimally coupled Peccei-Quinn Inflation and de Sitter Swampland Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of warm inflation within a non-minimally coupled Peccei-Quinn (PQ) framework and evaluate its compatibility with the de Sitter Swampland Conjecture. Our model incorporates a PQ scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity, facilitating inflation through a dissipative process that sustains a thermal bath, thereby distinguishing it from conventional cold inflation. We analyze the dissipation coefficient defined as $\Gamma(T, \sigma) = C_n T^n \sigma^p M^{1-n-p}$, where $C_n$ is a dimensionless constant, $M$ is a mass scale, and $n$ and $p$ are numerical powers. Our investigation focuses on three specific cases: (a) A temperature-dependent dissipation coefficient with an inverse relation, $\Gamma = C_{-1}\,\sigma^2/T$, where $n=-1$ and $p=2$; (b) A dissipation coefficient linear in field $\phi$, $\Gamma = C_{0} \sigma$, where $n=0$ and $p=1$; and (c) A dissipation coefficient linear in temperature $T$, $\Gamma = C_{1} T$, where $n=1$ and $p=0$. By examining the slow-roll dynamics in these inflationary scenarios, we derive essential cosmological parameters, including the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We compare our results with the latest observational data from Planck 2018. Our findings suggest that the model is consistent with observational constraints while simultaneously satisfying the de Sitter Swampland conditions.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. Although a supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole shares the same exact symmetries of the standard one, its metric does not explicitly respect these symmetries. However, one can define an asymptotic parity transformation, such that any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

We analyze particle production rates in the region of dynamical horizons, revealing an initial high rate followed by a rapid decline in all cases. Additionally, we explore the thermodynamic properties by calculating the surface gravity and corresponding Hayward-Kodama temperatures for each scenario. Graphical representations show the variation of surface gravity over time for the three cases, offering insights into the system's thermodynamic evolution. Our research investigates the connection between background geometry and the particle creation process, placing it within the broader context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The non-stationary nature of Vaidya geometry is highlighted as a valuable framework for examining the dynamic aspects of particle creation. This in-depth analysis enhances our understanding of quantum processes in curved spacetime and may offer insights relevant to thermodynamics and studies of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Dynamical time and Ashtekar variables for the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model and some extensions thereof that incorporate a dynamical time variable is explored. To this end, we rely on the geometric approach to the Hamiltonian dynamics of singular (constrained) systems provided by the Gotay-Nester-Hinds method (GNH). We also use recent results regarding the derivation of the Ashtekar formulation for Euclidean general relativity without using the time gauge. The insights provided by the geometric approach followed in the paper shed light on several issues related to the dynamics of general relativity and the role of time.</description>

      <title>A Generally Covariant Model of Spacetime as a 4-Brane in 4+1 Flat Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a simple model of a closed FLRW spacetime by starting from a flat five dimensional scalar field space with a quartic potential. The action contains no curvature terms. The spacetime metric is uniquely determined from the dynamical equations of the metric tensor. An SO(4) invariant ansatz for the scalar fields is shown to lead to a linearly expanding universe provided that the cosmological constant is negative.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. For this purpose, we utilize recently available data, including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions measurements, together with future gravitational wave data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In particular, we create three LISA mock catalogs, namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters from current observations. Numerical analysis reveals that LISA standard sirens (SS) make improvements on constraining $f(R,T)$ model cosmological parameters. Moreover, MCMC results based on mock LISA SS denote strong evidence in favor of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Thereupon, we perceive that LISA SS are capable to provide novel constraints on modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Interacting hypersurfaces and multiple scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to construct ghostfree multiple scalar-tensor theory. The idea is to use geometric quantities of hypersurfaces specified by the scalar fields, instead of covariant derivatives of the scalar fields or spacetime curvature, to construct the theory. This approach has been proved useful in building ghostfree scalar-tensor theory in the single field case. In the presence of multiple scalar fields, each scalar field specifies a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces, on which the normal vector, induced metric, extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures as well as extrinsic (Lie) and intrinsic (spatial) derivatives can be defined respectively. By using these hypersurface geometric quantities as building blocks, we can construct the Lagrangian for interacting hypersurfaces, which describes multiple scalar-tensor theory. Since temporal (Lie) and spatial derivatives are separated, it is relatively easier to control the order of time derivatives in order to evade ghostlike or unwanted degrees of freedom. In this work, we take bi-scalar-field theory as an example and focus on polynomial-type Lagrangians. We construct monomials built of the hypersurface geometric quantities up to $d=3$, with $d$ the number of derivatives in each monomial. We also present the correspondence between expressions in terms of hypersurface quantities and the expressions of covariant bi-scalar-tensor theory. By performing a cosmological perturbation analysis of a simple model as an example, we show that the theory indeed propagates two tensor and two scalar degrees of freedom at the linear order in perturbations, and is thus free of any extra degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in extended scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: the richness of the solution spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars are natural laboratories for testing gravity in the strong field regime. That is why the full spectrum of neutron star solutions in different modified theories should be thoroughly studied. Among the most natural modifications of general relativity are the theories in which additional scalar degrees of freedom are present. That is why scalar-tensor theories like Brans--Dike and Damour--Esposito--Farese theories, as well as their extensions such as scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, attracted attention throughout the years. In the present work, we combine those theory families and explore extensively the neutron star solution space in their realm. We identify qualitative new behavior of the solutions, including the existence of new types of phase transitions and new branches of solutions present only for high neutron star masses. Due to the peculiarities of the solutions, they can not be easily mimicked by a simple change of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial planes around intermediate mass spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial planes in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This year marks half a century since Stephen Hawking made his greatest scientific discovery by theoretically proving that black holes aint so black, as they behave like hot bodies with an absolute temperature that depends inversely on their mass. This discovery is expressed by a simple and elegant equation known as the Hawking temperature. The best way to commemorate this great scientific event is by bringing it to a wide audience. The simplest and most transparent and intuitive tool to achieve this goal is dimensional analysis. The objective of this work is to use this tool to derive the Hawking equation, reveal its meaning, and explore its main physical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "frozen star" picture of black holes, based on the fact that an outside observer will never see a collapsing sphere shrink sufficiently to form a black hole horizon, was a historical obstacle to the understanding of black holes, and continues to be a stumbling point for students trying to understand horizons. Promoting the discrete steps in Zeno's original story of Achilles and the tortoise to a "Zeno time coordinate" provides a quantitative toy model that allows students to understand why the "frozen star" phenomenon does not mean that objects cannot fall into a black hole. The toy model can be used for teaching about this particular feature of black holes in an introductory setting that does not introduce the Schwarzschild metric and its tortoise coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive guide to gravitational wave data processing, with a particular focus on signal generation, noise modeling, and optimization techniques. Beginning with an introduction to gravitational waves and the detection techniques used by LIGO and Virgo, the manual covers the essentials of signal processing, including Fourier analysis, filtering, and the generation of quadratic chirp signals. The analysis of colored Gaussian noise and its impact on interferometric detectors like LIGO is explored in detail, alongside signal detection methods such as the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). The paper also delves into optimization techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which can be applied to improve signal estimation accuracy. By providing MATLAB-based implementations, this manual serves as both a theoretical and practical resource for researchers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field decreases the mass of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

Abstract: Modifying the fundamental commutation relation of quantum mechanics to reflect the influence of gravity is an important approach to reconcile the contradiction between quantum field theory and general relativity. In the past two decades, researchers have conducted extensive research on geometric phase problems in non-commutative spaces, but few have mentioned the correction of geometric phase problems using the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This paper is the first to study the phase correction of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect by GUP.</description>

      <title>Solving the PTA Data Analysis Problem with a Global Gibbs Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The announcement in the summer of 2023 about the discovery of evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has ignited both the PTA and the larger scientific community's interest in the experiment and the scientific implications of its findings. As a result, numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing various aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to improving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this regard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the use of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model all unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a separate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability distribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by analyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our technique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in recovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red) noise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both its auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from single-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via analytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotic Safety is a promising framework towards the understanding, in a non-perturbative way, of Quantum Gravity. It treats the Newton's constant G_N and the cosmological constant \Lambda as running coupling of an effective action. At the phenomenological point of view the values of G_N and \Lambda depend on the energy density of the system under consideration. This fact has interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences. The present work discusses the effects on the distance measurements from SNIa light curves and on the strong and weak gravitational lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>

Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every $ \sim 8.3$ days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\'a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.</description>

Abstract: Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Static Black Holes in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by two static black hole models (Model-1 and Model-2) within the Effective Quantum Gravity (EQG) framework, characterized by mass $M$ and parameter $\zeta$. For $\zeta = 0$, they reduce to the Schwarzschild solution, and depending on the parameters, they describe black holes with an event and Cauchy horizon (Model-1), a single horizon (Model-2), or no horizons. Using SMBHs Sgr A* and M87* as lenses and integrating theoretical predictions with recent EHT data, we identify significant differences in lensing signatures due to quantum corrections. For Model-1, the deviations of the lensing observables: $|\delta\theta_{\infty}|$ of black holes in EQG from Schwarzschild black hole, for SMBHs Sgr A* and M87, can reach as much as $1.75~\mu$as and $1.32~\mu$as, while $|\delta s|$ is about $30.12$~nas for Sgr A* and $22.63$~nas for M87*. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent packed images indicates that EQG black hole images are brighter than their Schwarzschild counterparts, with a deviation in the brightness ratio $|\delta r_{mag}|$ reaching up to 2.02. The time delays between the second and first images, denoted $|\delta T_{2,1}|$, exhibit substantial deviations from the GR counterpart, reaching up to 1.53 min for Sgr A* and 1159.9 min for M87*. The EHT constraints on $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ region limit the parameters $\zeta$. Our analysis concludes that EQG black holes are consistent with the EHT observations within this finite space.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Population Constraints with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a massive black hole and a stellar compact object, are one of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin. Their population study can be used to constrain astrophysical models that interpret the EMRI formation mechanisms. In this paper, as a first step, we employ a parametrization method to describe the EMRI population model in the loss cone formation channel. This approach, however, can be extended to other models such as the accretion disc driven formation channel. We present the phenomenological characteristic of the MBH mass, spin, and redshift distributions. Then, we investigate the posterior distribution of the hyper-parameters that describe this population model. Our results show that TianQin could recover almost all the posterior of the hyper-parameters within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. With one hundred detectable EMRI events, the hyper-parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, b$, which describe the MBH mass distribution, could be measured with an accuracy of $37\%$, $24\%$, and $3\%$, respectively. The hyper-parameters $\mu_z$, and $\sigma_z$, which describe the redshift distribution, have $\mu_z$ above the detectable range of TianQin, and $\sigma_z$ measured with an accuracy of $14.5\%$. With this estimation accuracy, the EMRI population characteristics can be effectively demonstrated, potentially serving as evidence for EMRI formation in the future studies. Furthermore, with an increasing number of detectable events, the parameter estimation for the hyper-parameters will improve and the confidence intervals will be narrowed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instantons and the quality problem of the QCD axion: Facts, speculations, and statements in between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we critically reanalyze the explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn global symmetry -- and the corresponding corrections to the QCD axion potential -- induced by gravity. Specifically, we examine the role of gravitational instantons, which are non-perturbative, finite-action solutions to the Euclidean Einstein equations. These instantons represent topologically nontrivial configurations of spacetime and are analogous to instantons in gauge theory. The amount of symmetry breaking induced by gravitational instantons can be computed in a controlled way within the framework of semi-classical gravity, using 't Hooft operators, in full analogy to the computation of the axion potential arising from QCD small instanton effects. Contrary to previous results in the literature, we find that the effects of gravitational instantons are extremely small and therefore do not give rise to a significant quality problem for the axion solution to the strong CP problem, both within the Standard Model and in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios that involve multiple copies of the Standard Model. In conclusion, we argue that, assuming the ultraviolet completion of gravity is weakly coupled, the axion solution to the strong CP problem remains free from any quality issues due to gravity. Along the way, we derive the effective Lagrangian of the QCD axion, including its gravitational coupling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>

      <title>Waveform accuracy and systematic uncertainties in current gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The post-Newtonian formalism plays an integral role in the models used to extract information from gravitational wave data, but models that incorporate this formalism are inherently approximations. Disagreement between an approximate model and nature will produce mismodeling biases in the parameters inferred from data, introducing systematic error. We here carry out a proof-of-principle study of such systematic error by considering signals produced by quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries through an injection and recovery campaign. In particular, we study how unknown, but calibrated, higher-order post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational wave phase impact systematic error in recovered parameters. As a first study, we produce injected data of non-spinning binaries as detected by a current, second-generation network of ground-based observatories and recover them with models of varying PN order in the phase. We find that the truncation of higher order (&gt;3.5) post-Newtonian corrections to the phase can produce significant systematic error even at signal-to-noise ratios of current detector networks. We propose a method to mitigate systematic error by marginalizing over our ignorance in the waveform through the inclusion of higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients as new model parameters. We show that this method can reduce systematic error greatly at the cost of increasing statistical error.</description>

      <title>Testing general relativity via direct measurement of black hole kicks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric emission of gravitational waves during a compact binary coalescence results in the loss of linear momentum and a corresponding "kick" or recoil on the binary's center of mass. This leads to a direction-dependent Doppler shift of the ringdown gravitational waveform. We quantify the measurability of the kick imparted to the remnant black hole in a binary black hole merger. Future ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors will measure this effect to within $\sim 2\%$ to $\sim 30\%$ for a subset of their expected observed sources. Certain binary configurations in the LISA band may allow a sub-percent-level measurement of this effect. This direct measurement of black hole kicks can also facilitate a novel test of general relativity based on linear momentum balance. We formulate this kick consistency test via measurement of a null variable that quantifies the difference between the inferred kick (using numerical relativity) and that observed via the Doppler-shifted ringdown signal. This null variable can be constrained (at 90\% confidence) to $\sim 10\%$ to $30\%$ with Cosmic Explorer and to $\sim 3\%$ to $12\%$ with LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a potent mean to test the underlying theory of gravity. In general theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor theories, one expects modifications in the friction term and the sound speed in the gravitational wave equation. In that case, rapid oscillations in such coefficients, e.g. due to an oscillating scalar field, may lead to narrow parametric resonances in the gravitational wave strain. We perform a general analysis of such possibility within DHOST theories. We use disformal transformations to find the theory space with larger resonances, within an effective field theory approach. We then apply our formalism to a non-minimally coupled ultra-light dark matter scalar field, assuming the presence of a primordial gravitational wave background, e.g., from inflation. We find that the resonant peaks in the spectral density may be detectable by forthcoming detectors such as LISA, Taiji, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

Abstract: The Gotay-Nester-Hinds method is used in this paper to study the Hamiltonian formulation of the Euclidean self-dual action. This action can be used to arrive at the complex Ashtekar formulation of General Relativity or a real connection formulation for Euclidean General Relativity. The main result of the paper is a derivation of the Ashtekar formulation for Euclidean gravity without using any gauge fixing. It is interesting to compare this derivation with the one corresponding to the Holst action. In particular it is worth noting that no "tertiary" constraints appear in the case considered in the present paper.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from interferometric detectors like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA is routinely analyzed by rapid matched-filtering algorithms to detect compact binary merger events and rapidly infer their spatial position, which enables the discovery of associated non-GW transients like GRB 170817A and AT2017gfo. One of the critical requirements for finding such counterparts is that the rapidly inferred sky location, usually performed by the Bayestar algorithm, is correct. The reliability of this data product relies on various assumptions and a tuning parameter in Bayestar, which we investigate in this paper in the context of PyCBC Live, one of the rapid search algorithms used by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. We perform simulations of compact binary coalescence signals recovered by PyCBC Live and localized by Bayestar, under various configurations with different balances between simplicity and realism, and we test the resulting sky localizations for consistency based on the widely-used PP plot. We identify some aspects of the search configuration which drive the optimal setting of Bayestar's tuning parameter, in particular the properties of the template bank used for matched filtering. On the other hand, we find that this parameter does not depend strongly on the nonstationary and non-Gaussian properties of the detector noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stationary, axisymmetric, dust sourced solutions of Einstein's equations have been proposed as fully general relativistic models for disc galaxies. These models introduce a novel physical element, i.e., a non-negligible dragging vortex emerging from a full consideration of the essential self-interaction of matter and geometry in general relativity, which might demand a profound recalibration of the inferred amount of dark matter in disc galaxies. Within this framework, we identify the correct observables for redshift-inferred rotation curves of distant galaxies, correcting previously overlooked mistakes in the literature. We find that the presence of the dragging vortex introduces non-negligible corrective terms for the matter density required to maintain a stable physical system. We present the first estimate of the dragging speed which is required to explain a non-negligible fraction of dark matter in disc galaxies. In particular, we show that a sub-relativistic dragging velocity of tens of kilometers per second in the neighbourhood of the Sun is sufficient to reduce the need of dark matter by 50% in the Milky Way. Finally, we find that the presence of such a dragging vortex also returns a net contribution to the strong gravitational lensing generated by the galaxy. Thus, we show that the considered class of general relativistic galaxy models, is not only physically viable, but suggests the need for recalibration of the estimated dark matter content in disc galaxies, with far reaching consequences for astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the kinematic effects on a gravitational wave due to either a peculiar motion of the astrophysical source emitting it or a local motion of the observer. Working in the context of general relativity, we show at fully non-linear order in velocity, that the amplitude of the wave is amplified by the Doppler factor in the case in which the source moves with respect to a reference frame, while it is invariant if the observer moves (with respect to a reference observer). However, the observed specific intensity transforms in the same way under a boost of the source or of the observer. We also show at fully non-linear order that under a boost (of either source or observer), the polarization tensor is rotated in the same way the wave direction is rotated by aberration, such that the only net effect of a boost on polarization is to change the phase of the helicity components. We apply these results to a wave emitted by a binary system of compact objects in the cosmological context.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Searching for small primordial black holes in planets, asteroids and here on Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity II: Hairy Solutions and Linear Stability of the Non- and Partially Proportional Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to our work in part I of this series of papers, it is understood that the analytically known black hole solutions in the theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity can be split into three distinct classes, and that one of these classes - the proportional branch - exhibits the Gregory-Laflamme instability at linear level in the metric perturbations, whenever the black hole horizon size is smaller than (roughly) the Compton wavelength of the theory's lightest massive graviton. In this first of two sequels, we determine the linear stability of the two remaining classes of black hole solutions - the non-proportional and partially proportional branches - and discuss how our results likely differ at nonlinear level. We also give a general prescription to construct multi-metric solutions describing black holes endowed with massive graviton hair, which may constitute the end state of the instability in the proportional branch. We utilise a tractable example model involving 3 metrics to see how this works in practice, and determine the asymptotic form of its corresponding hairy solutions at infinity, where one can clearly see the individual contributions from each of the graviton mass modes.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Clumps with Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark compact objects ("clumps") transiting the Solar System exert accelerations on the test masses (TM) in a gravitational-wave (GW) detector. We reexamine the detectability of these clump transits in a variety of current and future GW detectors, operating over a broad range of frequencies. TM accelerations induced by clump transits through the inner Solar System have frequency content around $f \sim \mu$Hz. Some of us [arXiv:2112.11431] recently proposed a GW detection concept with $\mu$Hz sensitivity, based on asteroid-to-asteroid ranging. From the detailed sensitivity projection for this concept, we find both analytically and in simulation that purely gravitational clump-matter interactions would yield one detectable transit every $\sim 20$ yrs, if clumps with mass $m_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^{14} \text{kg}$ saturate the dark-matter (DM) density. Other (proposed) GW detectors using local TMs and operating in higher frequency bands are sensitive to smaller clump masses and have smaller rates of discoverable signals. We also consider the case of clumps endowed with an additional attractive long-range clump-matter fifth force significantly stronger than gravity (but evading known fifth-force constraints). For the $\mu$Hz detector concept, we use simulations to show that, for example, a clump-matter fifth-force $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than gravity with a range of $\sim\text{AU}$ would boost the rate of detectable transits to a few per year for clumps in the mass range $10^{11} \text{kg} \lesssim m_{\text{cl}} \lesssim 10^{14} \text{kg}$, even if they are a $\sim 1$% sub-component of the DM. The ability of $\mu$Hz GW detectors to probe asteroid-mass-scale dark objects that may otherwise be undetectable bolsters the science case for their development.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Happiest Moment: The Equivalence Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's happiest thought was his leap from the observation that a falling person feels no gravity to the realization that gravity might be equivalent to acceleration. It affects all bodies in the same way because it is a property of spacetime -- its curvature -- not a force propagating through spacetime (like electromagnetic or nuclear forces). When expressed in a way that is manifestly independent of the choice of coordinates, this idea became General Relativity. But the ground for what is now known as the "equivalence principle" was laid long before Einstein, affording a fascinating example of the growth of a scientific idea through the continuous interplay between theory and experiment. That story continues through the present era, with improved techniques and measurements, and in the new environment of space. Theoretically, equivalence is now understood to rank with Lorentz invariance as one of nature's most fundamental principles. Violations of equivalence are generically predicted by attempts to unify gravity with "non-geometrical" fundamental interactions, but there is no consensus on the form that these violations will take. Experimental tests of equivalence thus face the challenge of striving simultaneously for the highest possible sensitivity and diversity in test materials.</description>

      <title>A First Principles Numerical Demonstration of Emergent Decoherent Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states or ensemble averages.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitterian "massive" elementary systems and their Minkowskian and Newton-Hooke contraction limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate the definition and properties of "massive" elementary systems in the $(1+3)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_4$) spacetime, on both classical and quantum levels. We fully exploit the symmetry group {isomorphic to} Sp$(4,R)$, that is, the two-fold covering of SO$_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\mathbb R) \sim$ SO$_0(2,3)\times \mathbb Z_2$), recognized as the relativity/kinematical group of motions in AdS$_4$ spacetime. In particular, we discuss that the group coset Sp$(4,\mathbb R)/\mathrm{S}\big(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\big)$, as one of the Cartan classical domains, can be interpreted as a phase space for the set of free motions of a test massive particle on AdS$_4$ spacetime; technically, in order to facilitate the computations, the whole process is carried out in terms of complex quaternions. The (projective) unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,R)$ group, describing the quantum version of such motions, are found in the discrete series of the Sp$(4,\mathbb R)$ UIRs. We also describe the null-curvature (Poincar\'{e}) and non-relativistic (Newton-Hooke) contraction limits of such systems, on both classical and quantum levels. On this basis, we unveil the dual nature of "massive" elementary systems living in AdS$_4$ spacetime, as each being a combination of a Minkowskian-like elementary system {with positive proper mass}, with an isotropic harmonic oscillator arising from the AdS$_4$ curvature and viewed as a Newton-Hooke elementary system. This matter-vibration duality will take its whole importance in the quantum regime (in the context of the validity of the equipartition theorem) in view of its possible r\^{o}le in the explanation of the current existence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Algebras and Hilbert spaces from gravitational path integrals: Understanding Ryu-Takayanagi/HRT as entropy without AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works by Chandrasekaran, Penington, and Witten have shown in various special contexts that the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) entropy (or its covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) generalization) can be understood as computing an entropy on an algebra of bulk observables. These arguments do not rely on the existence of a local holographic dual field theory. We show that analogous-but-stronger results hold in any UV-completion of asymptotically AdS quantum gravity with a Euclidean path integral satisfying a simple and (largely) familiar set of axioms. We consider a quantum context in which a standard Lorentz-signature classical bulk limit would have Cauchy slices with asymptotic boundaries $B_L \sqcup B_R$ where both $B_L$ and $B_R$ are compact manifolds without boundary. Our main result is that (the UV-completion of) the quantum gravity path integral defines type I von Neumann algebras ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ of observables acting respectively at $B_L$, $B_R$ such that ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ are commutants. The path integral also defines entropies on ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L, {\cal A}^{B_R}_R$. Positivity of the Hilbert space inner product then turns out to require the entropy of any projection operator to be quantized in the form $\ln N$ for some $N \in {\mathbb Z}^+$ (unless it is infinite). As a result, our entropies can be written in terms of standard density matrices and standard Hilbert space traces. Furthermore, in appropriate semiclassical limits our entropies are computed by the RT-formula with quantum corrections. Our work thus provides a Hilbert space interpretation of the RT entropy. Since our axioms do not severely constrain UV bulk structures, it is plausible that they hold equally well for successful formulations of string field theory, spin-foam models, or any other approach to constructing a UV-complete theory of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured in e-folds $\Delta N=N-N_\mathrm{end}$, in reference to the e-fold $N_\mathrm{end}$ at which inflation ended. Slow roll being necessarily violated towards the end of inflation, both the approximated trajectory and $N_\mathrm{end}$ are determined at, typically, one or two e-folds precision. Up to now, such an uncertainty has been innocuous, but this will no longer be the case with the forthcoming cosmological measurements. In this work, we introduce a new and simple analytical method, on top of the usual slow-roll approximation, that reduces uncertainties on $\Delta N$ to less than a tenth of an e-fold.</description>

      <title>Curbing PBHs with PTAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sizeable primordial curvature perturbations needed to seed a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be accompanied by a scalar-induced gravitational wave signal that can be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We derive conservative bounds on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at the PTA frequencies and estimate the implied constraints on the PBH abundance. We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics. The strength and the shape of the constraint depend on the shape of the power spectrum and the nature of the non-Gaussianities. We find that constraints on the PBH abundance arise in the mass range $0.1-10^3\, M_{\odot}$, with the sub-solar mass range being constrained only for narrow curvature power spectra. These constraints are softened when positive non-Gaussianity is introduced and can be eliminated when $f_{\rm NL} \gtrsim 5$. On the other hand, if the PBH abundance is computed via the theory of peaks, the PTA constraints on PBHs are significantly relaxed, signalling once more the theoretical uncertainties in assessing the PBH abundance. We further discuss how strong positive non-Gaussianites can allow for heavy PBHs to potentially seed supermassive BHs.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Accretion by Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs in dense astrophysical environments, such as planets or stars.</description>

      <title>Bridging inflation and reheating: chiral gravitational waves from aHz to GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate chiral gravitational wave (GW) signals generated from inflation to reheating, driven by a parity-violating (PV) term coupled to the inflaton. During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound horizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power spectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB as well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially detectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic instability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced amplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of backreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy scale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer a unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.</description>

      <title>Comment on "A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>
