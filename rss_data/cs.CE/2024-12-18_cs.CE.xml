      <title>Parameters Optimization of Pair Trading Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair trading is a market-neutral quantitative trading strategy that exploits price anomalies between two correlated assets. By taking simultaneous long and short positions, it generates profits based on relative price movements, independent of overall market trends. This study explores the mathematical foundations of pair trading, focusing on identifying cointegrated pairs, constructing trading signals, and optimizing model parameters to maximize returns. The results highlight the strategy's potential for consistent profitability even in volatile market conditions.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly.
  The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Flow Solver with Variable Liquid Compressibility and Temperature Equation for Partitioned Simulation of Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new solver developed in OpenFOAM for the modeling of lubricant in the narrow gap between two surfaces inducing hydrodynamic pressures up to few gigapascal. Cavitation is modeled using the homogeneous equilibrium model. The mechanical and thermodynamic constitutive behavior of the lubricant is accurately captured by inclusion of compressibility, lubricant rheology and thermal effects. Different constitutive models can be selected at run time, through the adoption of the modular approach of OpenFOAM. By combining the lubricant solver with a structural solver using a coupling tool, elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts can be accurately simulated in a partitioned way. The solution approach is validated and examples with different slip conditions are included. The benefit for the OpenFOAM community of this work is the creation of a new solver for lubricant flow in challenging conditions and at the same the illustration of combining OpenFOAM solvers with other open-source software packages.</description>

      <title>Efficient damage simulations under material uncertainties in a weakly-intrusive implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is not yet widely adapted in the design process of engineering components despite its importance for achieving sustainable and resource-efficient structures. This is mainly due to two reasons: 1) Tracing the effect of uncertainty in engineering simulations is a computationally challenging task. This is especially true for inelastic simulations as the whole loading history influences the results. 2) Implementations of efficient schemes in standard finite element software are lacking. In this paper, we are tackling both problems. We are proposing a \rev{weakly}-intrusive implementation of the time-separated stochastic mechanics in the finite element software Abaqus. The time-separated stochastic mechanics is an efficient and accurate method for the uncertainty quantification of structures with inelastic material behavior. The method effectivly separates the stochastic but time-independent from the deterministic but time-dependent behavior. The resulting scheme consists only two deterministic finite element simulations for homogeneous material fluctuations in order to approximate the stochastic behavior. This brings down the computational cost compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations by at least two orders of magnitude while ensuring accurate solutions. In this paper, the implementation details in Abaqus and numerical comparisons are presented for the example of damage simulations.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Approach to Automatic Creation of P&amp;ID Diagrams from Natural Language Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs) are foundational to the design, construction, and operation of workflows in the engineering and process industries. However, their manual creation is often labor-intensive, error-prone, and lacks robust mechanisms for error detection and correction. While recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, their application in automating generation of engineering workflows remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel copilot for automating the generation of P&amp;IDs from natural language descriptions. Leveraging a multi-step agentic workflow, our copilot provides a structured and iterative approach to diagram creation directly from Natural Language prompts. We demonstrate the feasibility of the generation process by evaluating the soundness and completeness of the workflow, and show improved results compared to vanilla zero-shot and few-shot generation approaches.</description>

      <title>Identification of Epileptic Spasms (ESES) Phases Using EEG Signals: A Vision Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new approach to the Epileptic Spasms (ESES) detection based on the EEG signals using Vision Transformers (ViT). Classic ESES detection approaches have usually been performed with manual processing or conventional algorithms, suffering from poor sample sizes, single-channel-based analyses, and low generalization abilities. In contrast, the proposed ViT model overcomes these limitations by using the attention mechanism to focus on the important features in multi-channel EEG data, which is contributing to both better accuracy and efficiency. The model processes frequency-domain representations of EEG signals, such as spectrograms, as image data to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in the signal. The model demonstrates high performance with an accuracy of 97% without requiring intensive data preprocessing, thus rendering it suitable for real-time clinical applications on a large scale. The method represents a significant development in the advancement of neurological disorders such as ESES in detection and analysis.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search in Scopus within "Article title, Abstract, Keywords" unveils 2,444 documents focused on the biomechanics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), mostly on AAA wall stress. Only 24 documents investigated AAA kinematics, an important topic that could potentially offer significant insights into the biomechanics of AAA. In this paper, we present an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, and non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using patient's time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images, with an objective to measure wall displacement and strain during the cardiac cycle. Our approach relies on regularized deformable image registration for estimating wall displacement, estimation of the local wall strain as the ratio of its normal displacement to its local radius of curvature, and local surface fitting with non-deterministic outlier detection for estimating the wall radius of curvature. We verified our approach against synthetic ground truth image data created by warping a 3D-CTA image of AAA using a realistic displacement field obtained from a finite element biomechanical model. We applied our approach to assess AAA wall displacements and strains in ten patients. Our kinematic analysis results indicated that the 99th percentile of circumferential wall strain, among all patients, ranged from 2.62% to 5.54%, with an average of 4.45% and a standard deviation of 0.87%. We also observed that AAA wall strains are significantly lower than those of a healthy aorta. Our work demonstrates that the registration-based measurement of AAA wall displacements in the direction normal to the wall is sufficiently accurate to reliably estimate strain from these displacements.</description>

      <title>Abdominal aortic aneurysm wall stress: A 7-line code in MATLAB and a one-click software application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the irreversible dilation of the lower aorta, usually detected incidentally during imaging for other health issues. Current clinical practice for managing AAA relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, based on the aneurysm's maximum diameter and growth rate, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of AAA rupture risk. Patient-specific AAA wall stress, computed using biomechanical models derived from medical images without needing patient-specific material properties, has been widely investigated for developing individualized AAA rupture risk predictors. Therefore, AAA wall stress, determined reliably and quickly, has the potential to enhance patient-specific treatment plans. This paper presents a 7-line code, written in MATLAB using the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox, for AAA wall stress computations via finite element analysis. The code takes AAA wall geometry as input and outputs stress components over the AAA wall domain. Additionally, we present a one-click standalone software application for AAA wall stress computation, developed based on our 7-line code using MATLAB Compiler. After verification, we used our code to compute AAA wall stress in ten patients. Our analysis indicated that the 99th percentile of maximum principal stress across all patients ranged from 0.307 MPa to 0.466 MPa, with an average of 0.380 MPa and a standard deviation of 0.048 MPa. Moreover, for every case, the MATLAB simulation time was less than a minute on a laptop workstation.</description>

      <title>An efficient pipeline to compute patient-specific cerebral aneurysm wall tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysm rupture, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage with a high mortality rate, disproportionately affects younger populations, resulting in a significant loss of productive life years. A significant proportion of these deaths is due to aneurysmal re-bleeding within the first three days following the initial bleed, prior to treatment. While early aneurysm treatment is recommended, there is no consensus on the ideal timing, and emergency treatment offers only an incremental benefit at a significant cost. Although various multivariable prediction models have been proposed to provide personalized risk assessments, no validated patient-specific predictor is available to rationalize emergency treatment. Furthermore, no model has yet incorporated emerging computational biomechanics-based biomarkers such as wall tension. In this paper, we proposed and validated an efficient semi-automatic pipeline to compute patient-specific cerebral aneurysm wall tension as a potential biomarker for the likelihood of re-bleeding. Our pipeline uses the patient's computed tomography angiography (CTA) image obtained at the time of subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosis to create a patient-specific biomechanical model of the cerebral aneurysm using the finite element method. A distinctive feature of our approach is the straightforward model creation and wall tension computation using shell finite elements, without requiring patient-specific material properties or aneurysm wall thickness. Our non-invasive, patient-specific method for cerebral aneurysm wall tension can potentially provide individualized risk prediction and enhance clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity $\unicode{x2013}$ from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
  In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to the Plastic Arbor framework, supporting simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the new framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. Using the new framework, we have already been able to investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, showing a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
  By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>

      <title>Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.</description>
