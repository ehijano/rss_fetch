      <title>Assessing the Risk of Proliferation via Fissile Material Breeding in ARC-class Fusion Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of a nuclear weapon requires access to kilogram-scale quantities of fissile material, which can be bred from fertile material like U-238 and Th-232 via neutron capture. Future fusion power plants, with total neutron source rates in excess of $10^{20}$ n/s, could breed weapons-relevant quantities of fissile material on short timescales, posing a breakout proliferation risk. The ARC-class fusion reactor design is characterized by demountable high temperature superconducting magnets, a FLiBe liquid immersion blanket, and a relatively small size ($\sim$ 4 m major radius, $\sim$ 1 m minor radius). We use the open-source Monte Carlo neutronics code OpenMC to perform self-consistent time-dependent simulations of a representative ARC-class blanket to assess the feasibility of a fissile breeding breakout scenario. We find that a significant quantity of fissile material can be bred in less than six months of full power operation for initial fertile inventories ranging from 5 to 50 metric tons, representing a non-negligible proliferation risk. We further study the feasibility of this scenario by examining other consequences of fissile breeding such as reduced tritium breeding ratio, extra heat from fission and decay heat, isotopic purity of bred material, and self-protection time of irradiated blanket material. We also examine the impact of Li-6 enrichment on fissile breeding and find that it substantially reduces breeding rate, motivating its use as a proliferation resistance tool.</description>

      <title>Urban topology and dynamics can assess green areas importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green areas are a crucial element in evolution of a city, contributing to improve citizens' life, to reduce effects of climate change, and to make possible the survival of other species in urban areas. Unfortunately, the above effects are difficult to assess quantitatively for regulators, stakeholders and experts, making troublesome the planning of city development. Here we present a method to estimate the impact of these areas in the city life based on the network topology of the city itself and on a simple model of dynamics on this structure. Movements between various areas of the city are simulated by means of an agent-based biased-diffusion process where citizens try to reach the nearest Public Green Area (PGA) from their position and the model is fed with real data about the density of populations in the cases of study. Firstly, we define a centrality measure of PGA's based on average farness measured on the city network; this approach outperforms information based on the simple topology. We then improve this quantity by taking into account the occupation of PGA's, thereby providing a quantitative measure of PGA usage for regulators.</description>

      <title>State Discretization for Continuous-State MDPs in Infectious Disease Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated decision-making problems under uncertainty may arise in the health policy context, such as infectious disease control for COVID-19 and other epidemics. These problems may sometimes be effectively solved using Markov decision processes (MDPs). However, the continuous or large state space of such problems for capturing infectious disease prevalence renders it difficult to implement tractable MDPs to identify the optimal disease control policy over time. We therefore develop an algorithm for discretizing continuous states for approximate MDP solutions in this context. We benchmark performance against a uniform discretization using both a synthetic example and an example of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Katz Index for Link Prediction: A Case Study on a Live Fish Movement Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aquaculture, disease spread models often neglect the dynamic interactions between farms, hindering accuracy. This study enhances the Katz index (KI) to incorporate spatial and temporal patterns of fish movement, improving the prediction of farms susceptible to disease via live fish transfers. We modified the Katz index to create models like the Weighted Katz Index (WKI), Edge Weighted Katz Index (EWKI), and combined models (e.g., KIEWKI). These incorporate spatial distances and temporal movement patterns for a comprehensive aquaculture network connection prediction framework. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-scores, AUPR, and AUROC. The EWKI model significantly outperformed the traditional KI and other variations. It achieved high precision (0.988), recall (0.712), F1-score (0.827), and AUPR (0.970). Combined models (KIEWKI, WKIEWKI) approached, but couldn't surpass, EWKI performance. This study highlights the value of extending Katz index models to improve disease spread predictions in aquaculture networks. The EWKI model's performance demonstrates an innovative and flexible approach to tackling spatial challenges within network analysis.</description>

      <title>The maximum capability of a topological feature in link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks offer a powerful approach to modeling complex systems by representing the underlying set of pairwise interactions. Link prediction is the task that predicts links of a network that are not directly visible, with profound applications in biological, social, and other complex systems. Despite intensive utilization of the topological feature in this task, it is unclear to what extent a feature can be leveraged to infer missing links. Here, we aim to unveil the capability of a topological feature in link prediction by identifying its prediction performance upper bound. We introduce a theoretical framework that is compatible with different indexes to gauge the feature, different prediction approaches to utilize the feature, and different metrics to quantify the prediction performance. The maximum capability of a topological feature follows a simple yet theoretically validated expression, which only depends on the extent to which the feature is held in missing and nonexistent links. Because a family of indexes based on the same feature shares the same upper bound, the potential of all others can be estimated from one single index. Furthermore, a feature's capability is lifted in the supervised prediction, which can be mathematically quantified, allowing us to estimate the benefit of applying machine learning algorithms. The universality of the pattern uncovered is empirically verified by 550 structurally diverse networks. The findings have applications in feature and method selection, and shed light on network characteristics that make a topological feature effective in link prediction.</description>

      <title>Parallels in the symbolism of star constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer the question whether, when forming constellations in the night sky, people in astronomical cultures around the world and through time consistently imagined and assigned the same symbolism to the same (type of) star group. Evidence of semantic parallels has so far been anecdotal. We use two complementary definitions for a star group: (1) a star group in a fixed region of the sky (regardless of its exact star composition), and (2) a star group with a particular shape and brightness (regardless of its location in the sky). Over a dataset of 2003 constellations from 82 astronomical cultures, we find many semantic parallels which are likely naturally induced by the shape and composition of the star pattern. In certain cultural regions, geometric and group symbols are perceived consistently over small and uniformly bright star groups, naturalistic humanoids in large star groups with non-linear minimum spanning tree (MST) and stars inside the convex hull, and reptiles in star groups with low aspect ratio or linear MST. These naturally induced semantics, seemingly endogenous to certain sky patterns, show that there are universal (rather than learnt) patterns behind forming and naming constellations.</description>

      <title>Socio-Physical Approach to Consensus Building and the Occurrence of Opinion Divisions Based on External Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of public networks has enabled instantaneous and interactive communication that transcends temporal and spatial constraints. The vast amount of textual data on the Web has facilitated the study of quantitative analysis of public opinion, which could not be visualized before. In this paper, we propose a new theory of opinion dynamics. This theory is designed to explain consensus building and opinion splitting in opinion exchanges on social media such as Twitter. With the spread of public networks, immediate and interactive communication that transcends temporal and spatial constraints has become possible, and research is underway to quantitatively analyze the distribution of public opinion, which has not been visualized until now, using vast amounts of text data. In this paper, we propose a model based on the Like Bounded Confidence Model, which represents opinions as continuous quantities. However, the Bounded Confidence mModel assumes that people with different opinions move without regard to their opinions, rather than ignoring them. Furthermore, our theory modeled the phenomenon in such a way that it can incorporate and represent the effects of external external pressure and dependence on surrounding conditions. This paper is a revised version of a paper submitted in December 2018(Opinion Dynamics Theory for Analysis of Consensus Formation and Division of Opinion on the Internet).</description>

      <title>Massive Case Study of Opinion Distribution in a Relationship with Mixed Trust and Distrust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulations in this paper are based on the theory of opinion dynamics, which incorporates both Opinion A and Opinion B, a case that is the inverse of Opinion A, in human relationships. It was confirmed that aspects of consensus building depend on the ratio of the trust coefficient to the distrust coefficient. In this study, the ratio of trust to distrust tended to vary like a phase transition around 55%, but we wanted to see if the same phenomenon could be confirmed in large-scale cases. In the previous case studies, this tendency has been observed from N = 300 to N = 1600 , and we will discuss the case of N = 10000 with N = 3000. By verifying the extent of the phenomenon on the social scale, we intend to consider simulation items for consensus building, such as consideration of the sensitivities of topics in online and offline opinion formation.</description>

      <title>An impossibility result for Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from micro-canonical bipartite graph ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are commonly used to sample from graph ensembles. Two graphs are neighbors in the state space if one can be obtained from the other with only a few modifications, e.g., edge rewirings. For many common ensembles, e.g., those preserving the degree sequences of bipartite graphs, rewiring operations involving two edges are sufficient to create a fully-connected state space, and they can be performed efficiently. We show that, for ensembles of bipartite graphs with fixed degree sequences and number of butterflies (k2,2 bi-cliques), there is no universal constant c such that a rewiring of at most c edges at every step is sufficient for any such ensemble to be fully connected. Our proof relies on an explicit construction of a family of pairs of graphs with the same degree sequences and number of butterflies, with each pair indexed by a natural c, and such that any sequence of rewiring operations transforming one graph into the other must include at least one rewiring operation involving at least c edges. Whether rewiring these many edges is sufficient to guarantee the full connectivity of the state space of any such ensemble remains an open question. Our result implies the impossibility of developing efficient, graph-agnostic, MCMC algorithms for these ensembles, as the necessity to rewire an impractically large number of edges may hinder taking a step on the state space.</description>
