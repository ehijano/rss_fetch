      <title>First Lasing and Stable Operation of a Direct-Amplification Enabled Harmonic Generation Free-Electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seeded free-electron lasers (FELs) capable of operating at repetition rates up to the MHz level are in high demand for advanced time-resolved spectroscopies, which require both full longitudinal coherence and high average photon flux in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray regimes. However, conventional external-seed laser systems cannot sustain MHz operation with sufficient hundreds of megawatts peak power requirement due to their limited total power. Here, we report the first lasing and stable operation of a direct-amplification-enabled harmonic generation FEL driven by a weak seed laser with MW-level peak power. Beginning with an ultraviolet seed laser with only 0.75 {\mu}J pulse energy, we demonstrate its direct amplification to over 10 {\mu}J within an 8-meter-long modulator. We observe coherent harmonic generation up to the 12th harmonic of the seed and achieve saturation of the 7th harmonic in the radiator. These results represent a crucial milestone toward the realization of MHz-class, fully coherent EUV and x-ray light sources.</description>

      <title>Resonant Island Trapping in a Fourth-Generation Synchrotron Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct observation of nonlinear resonance island trapping in a fourth-generation light source with working points far from the excited resonance and examine the nonlinear dynamics and properties of the trapped beam. The discovered dynamics of island trapping may help understand bunch purity and halo formation issues, create additional experimental capabilities for photon science applications, and present means of nonlinear characterization of the machine optics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Phase Space Manipulation for Attosecond Electron Bunch Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond electron beams are essential for investigating ultrafast structural and electronic dynamics in matter with atomic-scale resolution. We propose a novel method that enables robust attosecond-level electron bunch compression. This method employs THz-driven linear energy chirping and multidimensional phase-space manipulation, effectively compressing the electron bunch and suppressing its arrival timing jitter. Implemented in an MeV ultrafast electron diffraction beamline, this method compresses a 3~MeV, 0.1~pC electron beam from an initial duration of 50~fs to 810~as while retaining 6~fC of charge, with 850~as arrival-time jitter. This approach enables unprecedented timing resolution in ultrafast sciences and offers significant potential for other accelerator applications involving attosecond-scale electron beams.</description>

      <title>Coupled integral equations method with open boundary conditions for calculation the characteristics of structured waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of modification of the CASCIE code aimed at implementing open boundary conditions are presented. The accelerator section developed at CERN was chosen as a prototype for the structured waveguide under testing. Results of testing the CASCIE-M code confirms that the implementation of matrix open boundary conditions gives possibility to consider the structure in which waves enter and exit without additional reflections from couplers. It was shown that the dependence of the reflection coefficient on frequency differs from the similar dependence for a waveguide with couplers. It does not have a regular sequence of minimum and maximum values associated with reflections from the couplers and the formation of resonance conditions. This indicates that the reflections are of a different nature and are associated with inhomogeneity. The proposed modification of the coupled integral equation method allows us to investigate the accuracy of the field expansion on which coupled mode theory can be constructed that describes structured waveguides.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>
