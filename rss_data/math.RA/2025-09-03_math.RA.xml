      <title>A note on the ordered set $A^A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be finite partially ordered sets (ordered sets). We show that if the ordered sets of self-maps $A^A$ and $B^B$ (ordered pointwise) are isomorphic, then $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic. This resolves a question originating with Duffus (1978), with related results by Duffus--Wille and Farley.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Hilbert's basis theorem and the constructive Krull dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical mathematics, Gulliksen has introduced the length of Noetherian modules, and Brookfield has determined the length of Noetherian polynomial rings. Brookfield's result can be regarded as a quantitative version of Hilbert's basis theorem. In this paper, based on the inductive definition of Noetherian modules in constructive algebra, we introduce a constructive version of the length called $\alpha$-Noetherian modules, and present a constructive proof of some results by Brookfield. As a consequence, we obtain a new constructive proof of $\dim K[X_0,\ldots,X_{n-1}]&lt;1+n$ and $\dim\mathbb{Z}[X_0,\ldots,X_{n-1}]&lt;2+n$, where $K$ is a discrete field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricted Heisenberg Lie superalgebras are studied over an algebraically closed field F of characteristic p &gt; 2. We use the ordinary 1- and 2-cohomology spaces with trivial coefficients to compute the restricted 2-cohomology spaces. As an application, the corresponding restricted one-dimensional central extensions are described.</description>

      <title>Bessmertny\u{i} realizations of symmetric multivariate rational matrix functions over any field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following. First, every square matrix whose entries are multivariable rational functions over a field $\mathbb{F}$ has a Bessmertny\u{i} realization, i.e., is the Schur complement of an affine linear square matrix pencil with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}$. Second, if the matrix is also symmetric and the characteristic of the field $\mathbb{F}$ is not two then it has a symmetric Bessmertny\u{i} realization (i.e., the pencil can be chosen to consist of symmetric matrices) and counterexamples are given to prove this statement is false in general for fields of characteristic two. Third, for fields of characteristic two (e.g., binary or Boolean field), we completely characterize those functions that have a symmetric Bessmertny\u{i} realization. Finally, analogous results hold when restricted to the class of homogeneous degree-one rational functions. To solve these realization problems, i.e., finding such structured Bessmertny\u{i} realizations for a given multivariate rational function, we use state-space methods from systems theory to produce realizations for algebraic operations on Schur complements such as sums, products, inverses, and symmetrization, which become the elementary building blocks of our constructions. Further complications arise over fields of characteristic two, so a large part of the paper is devoted to developing additional methods to decide if the symmetric realization problem can be solved and, if so, to construction the symmetric realization for a given symmetric rational matrix function. Our motivations are discussed in the context of multidimensional linear systems theory on generalizing state-space representations for rational functions including the Givone-Roesser and Fornasini-Marchesini realizations.</description>

      <title>Almost inner derivations of Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An almost inner derivation of a Lie algebra $L$ is a derivation that coincides with an inner derivation on each one-dimensional subspace of $L$. The almost inner derivations form a subalgebra ${aDer}(L)$ of the Lie algebra ${Der}(L)$ of all derivations of $L$, containing the inner derivations ${iDer}(L)$ as an ideal. If $L$ is a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra, then ${aDer}(L)={iDer}(L)$, since all derivations of $L$ are inner.
  In this paper, we introduce and study almost inner derivations derivations of Lie superalgebras. Since simple Lie superalgebras may admit non-inner outer derivations, the existence of non-inner almost inner derivations becomes a nontrivial question. Nevertheless, we show that all almost inner derivations of finite-dimensional simple Lie superalgebras over $\mathbb C$ are inner. We also give examples of naturally occurring non-inner almost inner derivations derivations of some pseudo-reductive Lie superalgebras related to the Sato-Kimura classification of prehomogeneous vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Quillen-Suslin Theorem for connected cochain DG algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a connected cochain DG algebra and $P$ a DG $\mathscr{A}$-module such that its underlying graded module $P^{\#}$ is a finitely generated $\mathscr{A}^{\#}$-module. We show that $P$ is semi-free if it is semi-projective and it is categorically free if it is categorically projective. It can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Quillen-Suslin Theorem in DG context. As an application, we show that the ghost length and the cone length of a compact DG module coincide.</description>

      <title>On Hom-Analogues of Heaps and Trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Hom-heaps, Hom-trusses, and Hom-braces as natural Hom-type analogues of their classical counterparts. We establish the correspondence between Hom-heaps and Hom-groups, showing that the retract of a Hom-heap at a point yields a Hom-group precisely when the point is fixed under the twisting map. Three interrelated definitions of Hom-trusses are introduced and their structural properties are investigated, including the construction of modules over Hom-trusses. For Hom-braces, we propose three variants and demonstrate their close connections with Hom-trusses, proving in particular that certain Hom-trusses naturally give rise to Hom-braces and vice versa. Our results provide a systematic framework that extends heap and truss theory into the Hom-algebraic setting, opening new perspectives for applications in Yang--Baxter theory, non-associative geometry, and categorical algebra.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Healing Semigroups with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that heals corrupted finite semigroups, combining deterministic repair strategies with Machine Learning using a Random Forest Classifier. Corruption in these tables breaks associativity and invalidates the algebraic structure. Deterministic methods work for small cardinality n and low corruption but degrade rapidly. Our experiments, carried out on Mace4-generated data sets, demonstrate that our hybrid framework achieves higher healing rates than deterministic-only and ML-only baselines. At a corruption percentage of p=15%, our framework healed 95% of semigroups up to cardinality n=6 and 60% at n=10.</description>

Abstract: We study algebraic properties of the super Jordan plane~$\mathcal B$ introduced by I. Angiono, I. Heckenberger and the first named author. Concretely we show that $\mathcal B$ is super-prime and has a super-simple super-artinian ring of fractions. We also compute the groups of superalgebra and braided Hopf algebra automorphisms. Instrumental for our approach is the embedding of the Jordan plane as a subalgebra of $\mathcal B$.</description>

      <title>Notes on Simplifying the Construction of Barabanov Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To answer the question about the growth rate of matrix products, the concepts of joint and generalized spectral radius were introduced in the 1960s. A common tool for finding the joint/generalized spectral radius is the so-called extremal norms and, in particular, the Barabanov norm. The goal of this paper is to try to combine the advantages of different approaches based on the concept of extremality in order to obtain results that are simpler for everyday use. It is shown how the Dranishnikov-Konyagin theorem on the existence of a special invariant body for a set of matrices can be used to construct a Barabanov norm. A modified max-relaxation algorithm for constructing Barabanov norms, which follows from this theorem, is described. Additional techniques are also described that simplify the construction of Barabanov norms under the assumption that</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study arithmetic properties of factorizations of elements into products of generators, in monoids given with explicit presentations. After relating and comparing this perspective to the more usual approach of factoring into products of atoms, we explore how the relations in the presentation of a monoid affect factorization. In the process, we construct a large class of non-commutative fully elastic monoids. We also show that any finitely-presented cancellative normalizing monoid satisfies the Structure Theorem for Unions. Examples are constructed to demonstrate the sharpness of our results, and exhibit unusual factorization behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilization $\mathcal{S}$ of the module category over an artinian ring $\Lambda$ by formally inverting the tensor endofunctor given by the bimodule of relative noncommutative differential $1$-forms. It turns out that $\mathcal{S}$ is a Frobenius abelian category, which is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the zeroth component $L_0$ of the Leavitt ring $L$. It follows that $L_0$ is an FC ring in the sense of Damiano, which is usually not quasi-Frobenius. Moreover, the singularity category of $\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to the stable module category over $L_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ be an affine scheme and (respectively) a finite-dimensional associative algebra over an algebraically-closed field $\Bbbk$, both equipped with actions by a linearly-reductive linear algebraic group $G$. We describe the simple finite-dimensional modules over the algebra of $G$-equivariant maps $X\to \mathfrak{a}$ in terms of the representation theory of the fixed-point subalgebras $\mathfrak{a}^x:=\mathfrak{a}^{G_x}\le \mathfrak{a}$, $G_x$ being the respective isotropy groups of closed-orbit $k$-points $x\in X$. This answers a question of E. Neher and A. Savage, extending an analogous result for (also linearly-reductive) finite-group actions. Moreover, the full category of finite-dimensional modules admits a direct-sum decomposition indexed by closed orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, if $R$ is an irreducible, continuous ring, then its unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$, equipped with the topology generated by the rank metric, is topologically simple modulo its center, path-connected, locally path-connected, bounded in the sense of Bourbaki, and not admitting any non-zero escape function. All these topological insights are consequences of more refined geometric results concerning the rank metric, in particular with regard to the set of algebraic elements. Thanks to the phenomenon of automatic continuity, our results also have non-trivial ramifications for the underlying abstract groups.</description>

      <title>Symmetric spaces for groups over involutive algebras and applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symplectic groups and indefinite orthogonal groups over involutive, possibly noncommutative, algebras $(A, \sigma)$. In the case when the algebra $(A, \sigma)$ is Hermitian, or the complexification $(A_{\mathbb{C}}, \sigma_{\mathbb{C}})$ of a Hermitian involutive algebra, one can identify maximal compact subgroups of such groups, and consider their associated Riemannian symmetric space. This new perspective allows for the realization of various geometric models for the symmetric space. We describe explicitly the complexified tangent space for each of the models, as well as the diffeomorphisms between them and their differentials.
  In an application of this theory, we introduce alternative notions of polystable Higgs bundles that can be used for the study of fundamental group representations into symplectic or into indefinite orthogonal groups over Hermitian involutive algebras. We characterize solutions to the relevant harmonicity equations with respect to these new models of the symmetric space. Reductive fundamental group representations then correspond to holomorphic pairs written with regard to these geometric incarnations of the associated symmetric space, thus allowing new insights for their study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</description>

      <title>Lifting noncommutative principal bundles along central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical theory of spin structures, we develop a theory for lifting free C$^*$-dynamical systems, a.k.a. noncommutative principal bundles, along central extensions. This theory extends the bundle-theoretic notion of spin structures and yields a complete existence and classification result for such lifts. Using factor system techniques and Picard formalism, our approach introduces new invariants and obstruction classes, thereby unifying geometric, cohomological, and operator-algebraic perspectives.</description>

      <title>$F$-birestriction monoids in enriched signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest to $F$-inverse monoids, on the one hand, and to restriction and birestriction monoids, on the other hand, we initiate the study of $F$-birestriction monoids as algebraic structures in the enriched signature $(\cdot, \, ^*, \,^+, \, ^{\mathfrak{m}},1)$ where the unary operation $(\cdot)^{\mathfrak{m}}$ maps each element to the maximum element of its $\sigma$-class.
  We find a presentation of the free $F$-birestriction monoid ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ as a birestriction monoid ${\mathcal F}$ over the extended set of generators $X\cup\overline{X^+}$ where $\overline{X^+}$ is a set in a bijection with the free semigroup $X^+$ and encodes the maximum elements of (non-projection) $\sigma$-classes. This enables us to show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ decomposes as the partial action product $E({\mathcal I})\rtimes X^*$ of the idempotent semilattice of the universal inverse monoid ${\mathcal I}$ of ${\mathcal F}$ partially acted upon by the free monoid $X^*$. Invoking Sch\"utzenberger graphs, we prove that the word problem for ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ and its strong and perfect analogues is decidable. Furthermore, we show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ does not admit a geometric model based on a quotient of the Margolis-Meakin expansion $M({\mathsf{FG}}(X), X\cup \overline{X^+})$ over the free group ${\mathsf{FG}}(X)$, but the free perfect $X$-generated $F$-birestriction monoid admits such a model.</description>

      <title>Totally acyclic complexes and homological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate equivalent characterizations of the condition that every acyclic complex of projective, injective, or flat modules is totally acyclic over a general ring R. We provide examples to illustrate relationships among these conditions and show that several are closely tied to the homological invariants silp(R), spli(R) and sfli(R). We also give sufficient conditions for the equality spli(R) = silp(R), thereby refining results due to Ballas-Chatzistavridis and Wang-Yang. Further, we extend a result of Christensen-Foxby-Holm on characterizations of Iwanaga-Gorenstein rings to the non-commutative setting. This generalizes a theorem of Estrada-Fu-Iacob, offering additional equivalent characterizations under a general assumption while also yielding characterizations of the Nakayama conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quasi-derivations of Witt and related algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we compute quasi-derivations of the Witt algebra and some algebras well-related to the Witt algebra. Namely, we prove that each quasi-derivation of the Witt algebra is a sum of a derivation and a $\frac{1}{2}$-derivation; a similar result is obtained for the Virasoro algebra. A different situation appears for Lie algebras ${\mathcal W}(a,b):$ in the case of $b=-1,$ they do not have interesting examples of quasi-derivations, but the case of $b\neq-1$ provides some new non-trivial examples of quasi-derivations. We also completely describe all quasi-derivations of ${\mathcal W}(a,b).$ As a corollary, we describe the derivations and quasi-derivations of the Novikov-Witt and admissible Novikov-Witt algebras previously constructed by Bai and his co-authors; and $\delta$-derivations and transposed $\delta$-Poisson structures on cited Lie algebras. In particular, we proved that each ${\mathcal W}(a,b)$ admits a nontrivial transposed $\frac 1{1-b}$-Poisson structure.</description>

      <title>The Arens-Michael envelope of a solvable Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19433v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Arens-Michael envelope of the universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism if and only if the Lie algebra is solvable. The necessity was proved by Pirkovskii in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 134, 2621--2631, 2006]. We prove the sufficiency.</description>

      <title>An algebraic proof of the dichotomy for graph orientation problems with forbidden tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a set F of finite tournaments, the F-free orientation problem is the problem of deciding if a given finite undirected graph can be oriented in such a way that the resulting oriented graph does not contain any member of F. Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new shorter proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems obtained recently by Bodirsky and Guzm\'{a}n-Pro. In fact, our approach yields a complexity dichotomy for a considerably larger class of computational problems where one is given an undirected graph along with additional local constraints on the allowed orientations. Moreover, the border between tractable and hard problems is also described by a decidable algebraic condition.</description>

      <title>Quivers with Polynomial Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of the quiver does not.</description>
