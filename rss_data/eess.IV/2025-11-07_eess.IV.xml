      <title>Reconstruction-free segmentation from undersampled k-space using transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: High acceleration factors place a limit on MRI image reconstruction. This limit is extended to segmentation models when treating these as subsequent independent processes.
  Goal: Our goal is to produce segmentations directly from sparse k-space measurements without the need for intermediate image reconstruction.
  Approach: We employ a transformer architecture to encode global k-space information into latent features. The produced latent vectors condition queried coordinates during decoding to generate segmentation class probabilities.
  Results: The model is able to produce better segmentations across high acceleration factors than image-based segmentation baselines.
  Impact: Cardiac segmentation directly from undersampled k-space samples circumvents the need for an intermediate image reconstruction step. This allows the potential to assess myocardial structure and function on higher acceleration factors than methods that rely on images as input.</description>

      <title>Computed Tomography (CT)-derived Cardiovascular Flow Estimation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks Improves with Sinogram-based Training: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings. We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.</description>

      <title>Shape Deformation Networks for Automated Aortic Valve Finite Element Meshing from 3D CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral) meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.</description>

      <title>DeepFixel: Crossing white matter fiber identification through spherical convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows for reconstruction of models for structural connectivity in the brain, such as fiber orientation distribution functions (ODFs) that describe the distribution, direction, and volume of white matter fiber bundles in a voxel. Crossing white matter fibers in voxels complicate analysis and can lead to errors in downstream tasks like tractography. We introduce one option for separating fiber ODFs by performing a nonlinear optimization to fit ODFs to the given data and penalizing terms that are not symmetric about the axis of the fiber. However, this optimization is non-convex and computationally infeasible across an entire image (approximately 1.01 x 106 ms per voxel). We introduce DeepFixel, a spherical convolutional neural network approximation for this nonlinear optimization. We model the probability distribution of fibers as a spherical mesh with higher angular resolution than a truncated spherical harmonic representation. To validate DeepFixel, we compare to the nonlinear optimization and a fixel-based separation algorithm of two-fiber and three-fiber ODFs. The median angular correlation coefficient is 1 (interquartile range of 0.00) using the nonlinear optimization algorithm, 0.988 (0.317) using a fiber bundle elements or "fixel"-based separation algorithm, and 0.973 (0.004) using DeepFixel. DeepFixel is more computationally efficient than the non-convex optimization (0.32 ms per voxel). DeepFixel's spherical mesh representation is successful at disentangling at smaller angular separations and smaller volume fractions than the fixel-based separation algorithm.</description>

      <title>$\mu$NeuFMT: Optical-Property-Adaptive Fluorescence Molecular Tomography via Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction, eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth). Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.</description>

      <title>Phenotype discovery of traumatic brain injury segmentations from heterogeneous multi-site data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is intrinsically heterogeneous, and typical clinical outcome measures like the Glasgow Coma Scale complicate this diversity. The large variability in severity and patient outcomes render it difficult to link structural damage to functional deficits. The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) repository contains large-scale multi-site magnetic resonance imaging data of varying resolutions and acquisition parameters (25 shared studies with 7,693 sessions that have age, sex and TBI status defined - 5,811 TBI and 1,882 controls). To reveal shared pathways of injury of TBI through imaging, we analyzed T1-weighted images from these sessions by first harmonizing to a local dataset and segmenting 132 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain. After running quality assurance, calculating the volumes of the ROIs, and removing outliers, we calculated the z-scores of volumes for all participants relative to the mean and standard deviation of the controls. We regressed out sex, age, and total brain volume with a multivariate linear regression, and we found significant differences in 37 ROIs between subjects with TBI and controls (p &lt; 0.05 with independent t-tests with false discovery rate correction). We found that differences originated in 1) the brainstem, occipital pole and structures posterior to the orbit, 2) subcortical gray matter and insular cortex, and 3) cerebral and cerebellar white matter using independent component analysis and clustering the component loadings of those with TBI.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based object detection of offshore platforms on Sentinel-1 Imagery and the impact of synthetic training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce, particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and 1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>X-Diffusion: Generating Detailed 3D MRI Volumes From a Single Image Using Cross-Sectional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial diagnostic tool, but high-resolution scans are often slow and expensive due to extensive data acquisition requirements. Traditional MRI reconstruction methods aim to expedite this process by filling in missing frequency components in the K-space, performing 3D-to-3D reconstructions that demand full 3D scans. In contrast, we introduce X-Diffusion, a novel cross-sectional diffusion model that reconstructs detailed 3D MRI volumes from extremely sparse spatial-domain inputs, achieving 2D-to-3D reconstruction from as little as a single 2D MRI slice or few slices. A key aspect of X-Diffusion is that it models MRI data as holistic 3D volumes during the cross-sectional training and inference, unlike previous learning approaches that treat MRI scans as collections of 2D slices in standard planes (coronal, axial, sagittal). We evaluated X-Diffusion on brain tumor MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Our results demonstrate that X-Diffusion not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative accuracy (PSNR) on unseen data but also preserves critical anatomical features such as tumor profiles, spine curvature, and brain volume. Remarkably, the model generalizes beyond the training domain, successfully reconstructing knee MRIs despite being trained exclusively on brain data. Medical expert evaluations further confirm the clinical relevance and fidelity of the generated images.To our knowledge, X-Diffusion is the first method capable of producing detailed 3D MRIs from highly limited 2D input data, potentially accelerating MRI acquisition and reducing associated costs.

      <title>Evaluating and Improving the Effectiveness of Synthetic Chest X-Rays for Medical Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</description>

Abstract: Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and produce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however, process raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As a result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their visual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information content, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not quantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific aspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with performance on secondary tasks.
  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly quantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By fitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics, our method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying gradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique for designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system performance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL matched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the prevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing algorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal performance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally efficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.

      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.
