      <description>arXiv:2410.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider injectivity and surjectivity of some maps on the exterior algebra of isomorphic finite-dimensional vector spaces. We prove the properties of the maps in full generality, for any dimension of the vector space and any subspace. We also draw a connection with the Palatini-Cartan formulation of General Relativity, for which these maps are of crucial importance.</description>

      <title>Spectral regularity and defects for the Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kohmoto model including Sturmian Hamiltonians and the associated Kohmoto butterfly. We prove spectral estimates for the operators using Farey numbers. In addition, we determine the impurities at rational rotations leading to the spectral defects in the Kohmoto butterfly. Our results are similar to the ones obtained for the Almost-Mathieu operator and the associated Hofstadter butterfly.</description>

      <title>Holographic Mixing and Fock Space Dynamics of Causal Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A limiting case is considered in which the causal action principle for causal fermion systems describing Minkowski space gives rise to the linear Fock space dynamics of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum nature of the bosonic field is a consequence of the stochastic description of a multitude of fluctuating fields coupled to non-commuting operators, taking into account dephasing effects. The scaling of all error terms is specified. Our analysis leads to the concept of holographic mixing, which is introduced and explained in detail.</description>

      <title>A Non-diffracting Resonant Angular Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conceptualise and numerically simulate a resonant metamaterial interface incorporating non-local, or beyond nearest neighbour, coupling that acts as a discrete angular filter. It can be designed to yield perfect transmission at customizable angles of incidence, without diffraction, allowing for tailored transmission in arbitrarily narrow wavenumber windows. The theory is developed in the setting of discrete, infinitely periodic quantum graphs and we realise it numerically as an acoustic meta-grating. The theory is then applied to continuous acoustic waveguides, first for the medium surrounding the interface and then for the interface itself, showing the efficacy of quantum graph theory in interface design.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity induced transition from homeostasis to catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the stochasticity driven transition from homeostasis to breakdown in an experimentally motivated and analytically tractable minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. These transitions occur as a single parameter is tuned; we predict the precise values of the parameter which mark the characteristic progression of the transition. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails and the reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution further characterize the transition to catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Geometric scattering for nonlinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a conformal scattering theory for the defocusing semilinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild spacetime. We combine the energy and pointwise decay results of solutions obtained in \cite{Yang} and a Sobolev embedding on spacelike hypersurfaces to establish the energy estimates in two sides between the energy flux of solution through the Cauchy initial hypersurface $\Sigma_0=\left\{ t=0 \right\}$ and the one through the null conformal boundaries $\mathfrak{H}^+\cup \scri^+$ (resp. $\mathfrak{H}^-\cup \scri^-$). Combining these estimates and the well-posedness of Cauchy and Goursat problems for nonlinear wave equations we provide a bounded linear and locally Lipschitz scattering operator which maps the past scattering data to the future scattering data. Our results extend also the previous works \cite{BaSeZho1990,Jo2012,Jo2019} to an asymptotically flat spacetime such as Schwarzschild spacetime which is static and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Surface observables in gauge theories, modular Painlev\'e tau functions and non-perturbative topological strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study BPS surface observables of $\mathcal{N}=2$ four dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory in gravitational $\Omega$-background at perturbative and at Argyres-Douglas superconformal fixed points. This is done by formulating the equivariant gauge theory on the blow-up of $\mathbb{C}^2$ and considering the decoupling Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. We show that in this limit the blow-up equations are solved by corresponding Painlev\'e $\mathcal{T}$-functions and exploit operator/state correspondence to compute their expansion in an integer basis, given in terms of the moduli of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve. We study the modular properties of these solutions and show that they do directly lead to BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations for the corresponding topological string partition function. The resulting $\mathcal{T}$-functions are holomorphic and modular and as such they provide a natural non-perturbative completion of topological strings partition functions.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to hydrodynamics for long-range generalized exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of generalized long-range exclusion processes evolving either on $\mathbb Z$ or on a finite lattice with an open boundary. The jump rates are given in terms of a general kernel depending on both the departure and destination sites, and it is such that the particle displacement has an infinite expectation, but some tail bounds are satisfied. We study the superballisitic scaling limit of the particle density and prove that its space-time evolution is concentrated on the set of weak solutions to a non-local transport equation. Since the stationary states of the dynamics are unknown, we develop a new approach to such a limit relying only on the algebraic structure of the Markovian generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of small data solutions to the screened Vlasov-Poisson equation on $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$ near vacuum. We show that for dimensions $d\geq 2$, under mild assumptions on localization (in terms of spatial moments) and regularity (in terms of at most three Sobolev derivatives) solutions scatter freely. In dimension $d=1$, we obtain a long time existence result in analytic regularity.</description>

      <title>Time evolution in quantum mechanics with a minimal time scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a minimum measurable length scale was suggested by various theories of quantum gravity, string theory and black hole physics. Motivated by this we examine a quantum theory exhibiting a minimum measurable time scale. We use the Page-Wootters formalism to describe time evolution of a quantum system with the modified commutation relations between the time and frequency operator. Such modification leads to a minimal uncertainty in the measurement of time. This causes breaking of the time-translation symmetry and results in a modified version of the Schrodinger equation. A minimal time scale allows also to introduce a discrete Schrodinger equation describing time evolution on a lattice. We show that both descriptions of time evolution are equivalent. We demonstrate the developed theory on couple simple quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A geometrical description of untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple, geometric and explicit construction of 3d untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with defects of all codimensions. It is given as a symmetric monoidal functor from a defect cobordism category into the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. The objects of this category are oriented stratified surfaces and its morphisms are equivalence classes of stratified cobordisms, both labelled with higher categorical data. This TQFT is constructed in terms of geometric quantities such as fundamental groupoids and bundles and requires neither state sums on triangulations nor diagrammatic calculi for higher categories. It is obtained from a functor that assigns to each defect surface a representation of a gauge groupoid and to each defect cobordism a fibrant span of groupoids and an intertwiner between the groupoid representations at its boundary. It is constructed by homotopy theoretic methods and allows for an explicit computation of examples. In particular, we show how the 2d part of this defect TQFT gives a simple description of defects of all codimensions in Kitaev's quantum double model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projective variety of square-zero elements in the six-dimensional minimal supersymmetry algebra is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^3$. We use this fact, together with the pure spinor superfield formalism, to study supermultiplets in six dimensions, starting from vector bundles on projective spaces. We classify all multiplets whose derived invariants for the supertranslation algebra form a line bundle over the nilpotence variety; one can think of such multiplets as being those whose holomorphic twists have rank one over Dolbeault forms on spacetime. In addition, we explicitly construct multiplets associated to natural higher-rank equivariant vector bundles, including the tangent and normal bundles as well as their duals. Among the multiplets constructed are the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet, the family of $\mathcal{O}(n)$-multiplets, and the supergravity and gravitino multiplets. Along the way, we tackle various theoretical problems within the pure spinor superfield formalism. In particular, we give some general discussion about the relation of the projective nilpotence variety to multiplets and prove general results on short exact sequences and dualities of sheaves in the context of the pure spinor superfield formalism.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the principal hierarchies for Frobenius manifolds with rational and trigonometric superpotentials, as well as their almost dualities. We demonstrate that in both cases, submanifolds with even superpotentials form natural Frobenius submanifolds, and their principal hierarchies can be obtained as restrictions of the principal hierarchies for the original Frobenius manifolds. Furthermore, we introduce a natural rank-1 extension for each of these Frobenius manifolds, providing solutions to the associated open WDVV equations. The principal hierarchy for each extension is also explicitly constructed.</description>

      <title>M\"obius invariant Y-systems (cluster structures) for Miquel dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miquel dynamics is a discrete time dynamics for circle patterns, which relies on Miquel's six circle theorem. Previous work shows that the evolution of the circle centers satisfy the dSKP equation on the octahedral lattice $A_3$. As a consequence, Miquel dynamics is a discrete integrable system. Moreover, Miquel dynamics give rise to a real-valued cluster structure. The evolution of the cluster variables under Miquel dynamics is also called a Y-system in the discrete integrable systems community. If the Y-system is real positive-valued then the circle pattern is accompanied by an invariant dimer model, an exactly solvable model studied in statistical physics. However, while circle patterns are M\"obius invariant, the circle centers and the Y-system are not M\"obius invariant, which violates the so called transformation group principle. In this article we show that half the intersection points satisfy the dSKP equation as well, and we introduce two new real-valued Y-systems for Miquel dynamics that involve only the intersection points. Therefore, the new Y-systems are M\"obius invariant, and thus satisfy the transformation group principle. We also show that the circle centers and intersection points combined satisfy the dSKP equation on the 4-dimensional octahedral lattice $A_4$. In addition, we present two more complex-valued Y-systems for Miquel dynamics, which are real-valued in and only in the case of integrable circle patterns. We also investigate the special cases of harmonic embeddings and s-embeddings, which relate to the spanning tree and Ising model respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, first we revisit the formal integration of Lie algebras, which give rise to braces in some special cases. Then we establish the formal integration theory for complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, that is, we show that there is a Rota-Baxter group with the underlying group structure given by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, associated to any complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebra. In particular, we use the post-Lie Magnus expansion to give the explicit formula of the Rota-Baxter operator. Finally we show that one can obtain a graded Rota-Baxter Lie ring from a filtered Rota-Baxter group.</description>

      <title>Detecting positive quantum capacities of quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a noisy quantum channel can be used to reliably transmit quantum information at a non-zero rate is a challenging problem in quantum information theory. This is because it requires computation of the channel's coherent information for an unbounded number of copies of the channel. In this paper, we devise an elementary perturbative technique to solve this problem in a wide variety of circumstances. Our analysis reveals that a channel's ability to transmit information is intimately connected to the relative sizes of its input, output, and environment spaces. We exploit this link to develop easy tests which can be used to detect positivity of quantum channel capacities simply by comparing the channels' input, output, and environment dimensions. Several noteworthy examples, such as the depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels (including the Werner-Holevo channel), dephasing channels, generalized Pauli channels, multi-level amplitude damping channels, and (conjugate) diagonal unitary covariant channels, serve to aptly exhibit the utility of our method. Notably, in all these examples, the coherent information of a single copy of the channel turns out to be positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the triangular prism equations for fusion categories, demonstrating their equivalence to the pentagon equations in the spherical case, modulo a change of basis. These equations offer valuable insights for managing complexity through localization. Additionally, we establish an enhanced version of Z. Wang's conjecture regarding the second Frobenius-Schur indicator in pivotal fusion categories. As applications, we introduce new categorification criteria and complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to FPdim 20000.</description>

      <title>Fully undistillable quantum states are separable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume that Alice, Bob, and Charlie share a tripartite pure state $|\psi_{ABC}\rangle$. We prove that if Alice cannot distill entanglement with either Bob or Charlie using $|\psi_{ABC}\rangle$ and local operations with any one of the following configurations for classical communication: $(A\to B, A\leftrightarrow C), (A\leftrightarrow B, A\to C),$ and $(A\leftrightarrow B, A\leftrightarrow C)$, then the same is also true for the other two configurations. Moreover, this happens precisely when the state is such that both its reductions on systems $AB$ and $AC$ are separable, which is further equivalent to the reductions being PPT. This, in particular, implies that any NPT bipartite state is such that either the state itself or its complement is 2-way distillable. To prove these results, we first obtain an explicit lower bound on the 2-way distillable entanglement of low rank bipartite states. Furthermore, we show that even though not all low rank states are 1-way distillable, a randomly sampled low rank state will almost surely be 1-way distillable.</description>

      <title>A short proof of Tomita's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomita-Takesaki theory associates a positive operator called the "modular operator" with a von Neumann algebra and a cyclic-separating vector. Tomita's theorem says that the unitary flow generated by the modular operator leaves the algebra invariant. I give a new, short proof of this theorem which only uses the analytic structure of unitary flows, and which avoids operator-valued Fourier transforms (as in van Daele's proof) and operator-valued Mellin transforms (as in Zsid\'{o}'s and Woronowicz's proofs). The proof is similar to one given by Bratteli and Robinson in the special case that the modular operator is bounded.</description>

      <title>Ising model on a Galton-Watson tree with a sparse random external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a supercritical Galton-Watson tree $\mathbf{T}_n$ of depth $n$ with a sparse random external field, given by a collection of i.i.d. Bernouilli random variables with vanishing parameter $p_n$. This may me viewed as a toy model for the Ising model on a configuration model with a few interfering external vertices carrying a plus spin: the question is to know how many (or how few) interfering vertices are enough to influence the whole graph. Our main result consists in providing a necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters $(p_n)_{n\geq 0}$ for the root of $\mathbf{T}_n$ to remain magnetized in the large $n$ limit. Our model is closely related to the Ising model on a (random) pruned sub-tree $\mathbf{T}_n^*$ with plus boundary condition; one key result is that this pruned tree turns out to be an inhomogeneous, $n$-dependent, Branching Process. We then use standard tools such as tree recursions and non-linear capacities to study the Ising model on this sequence of Galton-Watson trees; one difficulty is that the offspring distributions of $\mathbf{T}_n^*$, in addition to vary along the generations $0\leq k \leq n-1$, also depend on~$n$.</description>

      <title>The covariant Langevin equation of diffusion on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant form of the multivariable diffusion-drift process is described by the covariant Fokker--Planck equation using the standard toolbox of Riemann geometry. The covariant form of the equivalent Langevin stochastic differential equation is long sought after in both physics and mathematics. We show that the simplest covariant Stratonovich stochastic differential equation depending on the local orthogonal frame (cf. vielbein) becomes the desired covariant Langevin equation provided we impose an additional covariant constraint: the vectors of the frame must be divergence-free.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics on a background modulo observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we will answer the following question: What remains of Quantum Mechanics when we transform the background space-time into a space modularized by observation or measurement regions ? This new moduli space is constructed by identifying regions of space-time where quantum phase comparison (observation, measurement) is implied. We call it Observation Modular space (OM-space). In addition we replace in QM statements the Plank constant (h) by the quantity $\zeta_0 4 \pi^2$ (where $\zeta_0$ is the Plank Length) or otherwise, replacing $P_0$ (the Planck Momentum) by $4 \pi^2$. This maps Quantum Mechanics into a very rich dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum Mechanics (OM-QM). We find the OM-dual to the Dirac Equation, the quantum Wave Function and a free particle's mass. The OM-QM counterparts of the Energy turns out to be a simple function of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. We also find the OM-QM correspondents to the electron spin, the electron charge, the Electric Field and the Fine Structure Constant. We also find the OM-QM correspondents of the Heisemberg uncertainty relation and Einstein's General Relativity Field equation emerging as certain limits of a unique OM-QM equation. We also get the OM-QM correspondents of the Gravitational Constant and the Cosmological Constant. We find the analog of holography in the OM-QM side and we get an interpretation of spin as a high dimensional curvature. An interpretation of the OM-QM correspondence is proposed as giving the part of QM information which is not measurement or observation dependent. Some potential future applications of this correspondence are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired activation functions and quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study address this problem by investigating the functional expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical experiments on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Letter datasets, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model demonstrates superior feature selection capabilities and substantially reduces the required training steps compared to classical CNNs. Notably, we observe similar performance improvements when incorporating three other quantum-inspired activation functions in classical neural networks, indicating the benefits of adopting quantum-inspired activation functions. Additionally, we developed a hybrid quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network (QCPN) based on the properties of quantum activation functions. We demonstrate that a three-layer QCPN can approximate any continuous function, a feat not achievable by a standard three-layer classical neural network. Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired activation functions can reduce model depth while maintaining high learning capability, making them a promising approach for optimizing large-scale machine-learning models. We also outline future research directions for leveraging quantum advantages in machine learning, aiming to unlock further potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Self-consistency, relativism and many-particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interrelation between the concepts of self-consistency, relativism and many-particle systems is considered within the framework of a unified consideration of classical and quantum physics based on the first principle of the probability conservation law. The probability conservation law underlies the Vlasov equation chain. From the first Vlasov equation, the Schr\"odinger equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the equation of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the Maxwell equations, the Pauli equation and the Dirac equation are constructed. The paper shows with mathematical rigor that quantum systems with a time independent function of quasi-density probability in phase space are not capable to emit electromagnetic radiation. It is shown that at the micro-level a quantum object may be considered rather as an {\guillemotleft}extended{\guillemotright} object than a point one. And the hydrodynamic description of continuum mechanics is applicable for such an object. A number of exact solutions of quantum and classical model systems is considered, demonstrating a new insight at the quantum mechanics representation.</description>

      <title>On anomalous dissipation induced by transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of enstrophy and energy of solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and diffusion equations in all dimensions, respectively. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former allows us to obtain, for the first time for such type of scaling limits, convergence in a space of positive smoothness uniformly in time. Compared to known results, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Further, we discuss physical interpretations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classical and quantum dynamics of relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. It is shown that for a non-zero frequency parameter $\omega$ the covariant phase space of the classical Klein-Gordon oscillator is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6=\mathrm{Ad}S_7/\mathrm{U}(1)=\mathrm{U}(3,1)/\mathrm{U}(3)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$. In the limit $\omega\to 0$, this manifold is deformed into the covariant phase space $T^*H^3$ of a free relativistic particle, where $H^3=H^3_+\cup H_-^3$ is a two-sheeted hyperboloid in momentum space. Quantization of this model with $\omega\ne 0$ leads to the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation which we consider in the Segal-Bargmann representation. It is shown that the general solution of this model is given by functions from the weighted Bergman space of square-integrable holomorphic (for particles) and antiholomorphic (for antiparticles) functions on the K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$. This relativistic model is Lorentz covariant, unitary and does not contain non-physical states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>
