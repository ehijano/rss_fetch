      <title>$L_1$ and $L_2$ embeddings of the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Cayley graph of the symmetric group $Sym_n$ generated by the cycle $(123...n)$ and the transposition $(12)$ embeds into $L_1$ with bi-Lipschitz distortion $O(1)$. This answers a question of Ostrovskii, and along with Kassabov's theorem gives the first example of a sequence of groups which embed bi-Lipschitzly into $L_1$ for one choice of bounded size generating sets, but not for another choice of bounded size generating sets. In particular, the Cayley graphs generated by the cycle and the transposition cannot contain coarsely any unbounded sequence of expander graphs. Moreover, within the context of the Ribe program, they are a new example of bounded degree Cayley graphs which are test spaces for Rademacher type.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n x n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. This reveals a connection between magic square constraints and statistical structure: we prove that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We introduce a covariance energy functional -- the sum of squared covariances with row, column, and diagonal indicator variables -- and prove for n=3 (via exhaustive enumeration) that its zeros are precisely the magic squares. Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders. Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D_4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>The tangent space to the Wasserstein space: parallel transport and other applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new notion of the formal tangent space to the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}(X)$ at a given measure. Modulo an integrability condition, we say that this tangent space is made of functions over $X$ which are valued in the probability measures over the tangent bundle to $X$. This generalization of previous concepts of tangent spaces allows us to define appropriate notions of parallel transport, $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ regularity over $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and translation of a curve over $\mathcal{P}(X)$.</description>

      <title>The number of ends of big mapping class groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the number of ends of the mapping class group of a stable avenue surface. We prove that the mapping class group is one-ended whenever the stable avenue surface has at least one end of discrete type. Our method is to show that the associated translatable curve graph, which is quasi-isometric to the mapping class group, is one-ended.</description>

      <title>Explicit lower bounds for opaque sets of unit square and unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit lower bounds for the length of the shortest opaque set for the unit disc and the unit square in the Euclidean plane are derived. The results are based on an explicit application of the general method of Kawamura, Moriyama, Otachi and Pach. Employing a recent observation by Steinerberger on the possible orientations of straight barriers with length close to Jones' bound, we improve the bound for the unit square by more than a factor $3$. The bound for barriers of the unit disc is new and based on the idea that the free parameters in the general method from can be optimized due to the strong symmetry properties of the disc. Our approach illustrates both the power and the limitations of the method.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via matrix projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with angle $\arccos(\alpha)$ and gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha^2 - 2$. At the other extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\binom{r+1}{2}$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$. Applications of our method in the complex setting will be discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard theory of Banach spaces is built upon the notions of vector space, triangle inequality and Cauchy completeness. Here we propose a `hyperbolic' variant of this `elliptic' framework where general linear combinations are replaced by linear combinations with non-negative coefficients, triangle inequality is replaced by reverse triangle inequality and Cauchy completeness is replaced by the order-theoretic notion of directed completeness.
  The motivation for our investigation is in non-smooth Lorentzian geometry: we believe that to unlock the full potential of the field, and ultimately extract more informations about the smooth world, some version of `Lorentzian functional analysis' is needed, especially in relation to timelike lower Ricci curvature bounds.
  An example of structure we investigate is obtained by starting with a Banach space, multiplying it by $\mathbb R$ and considering the `future cone' in there. Because of this, some of the results in this manuscript might be read through the lenses of standard Banach spaces theory. From this perspective, the classical Hahn-Banach and Baire category theorems can be seen as consequences of statements obtained here.
  A different kind of example is that of $L^p$ spaces for $p\leq1$. Their structure and natural duality relations fit particularly well in our framework, to the extent that they have been an important source of inspiration for the axiomatization chosen in this paper.
  We also investigate the notion of directed completeness regardless of any algebraic structure, as we believe it is central even in the finite-dimensional non-smooth Lorentzian framework, for instance to achieve a compactness theorem \`a la Gromov. This study unveils connections between Geroch-Kronheimer-Penrose's concept of ideal point in a spacetime, Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem and certain aspects of domain theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Properties of Periodic Lattices in Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic lattices are natural generalizations of lattices, which arise naturally in diophantine approximations with rationals of bounded denominators. In this paper, we prove analogues of classical theorems in geometry of numbers for periodic lattices in function fields. Moreover, we use special matrices to compute the covering and packing radii of special periodic lattices.</description>
