      <title>Quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcement strategies. We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links (bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly synchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade failures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network. These models are built from the official data provided by the transmission system operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other studies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good agreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids.
  Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added transmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show that reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most significant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights differences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare results of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis software.
  Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size distributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while exponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings. The observed exponents are reminiscent of the continuously changing exponents due to Griffiths effects near a hybrid type of phase transition.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven Synchronization of Vicsek Model in Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model has long stood as a pivotal framework in exploring collective behavior and self-organization, captivating the scientific community with its compelling dynamics. However, understanding how noise influences synchronization within this model and its associated phase transition characteristics has presented significant challenges. While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments.</description>
