      <title>Decomposing Control Lyapunov Functions for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven to be successful for training intelligent agents in unknown environments. However, RL has not been applied widely in real-world robotics scenarios. This is because current state-of-the-art RL methods require large amounts of data to learn a specific task, leading to unreasonable costs when deploying the agent to collect data in real-world applications. In this paper, we build from existing work that reshapes the reward function in RL by introducing a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), which is demonstrated to reduce the sample complexity. Still, this formulation requires knowing a CLF of the system, but due to the lack of a general method, it is often a challenge to identify a suitable CLF. Existing work can compute low-dimensional CLFs via a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability procedure. However, this class of methods becomes intractable on high-dimensional systems, a problem that we address by using a system decomposition technique to compute what we call Decomposed Control Lyapunov Functions (DCLFs). We use the computed DCLF for reward shaping, which we show improves RL performance. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, where our method finds a policy to successfully land a quadcopter in less than half the amount of real-world data required by the state-of-the-art Soft-Actor Critic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Peak EV Charging Demand: The Impact of Segmented Network Tariffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregate peak Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand has become an increasingly concerning issue for network operators, impacting their reliable operations. Various network tariff schemes have been proposed to limit peak demand by incentivizing flexible asset users to shift their demand from peak periods. However, fewer studies quantify the overall effect of these tariff schemes, which operate at the level of individual connections, on the aggregate load. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a multi-level segmented network tariff on aggregate EV charging demand. The interaction between peak-reducing network tariffs and dynamic energy prices is studied, shedding light on the competition between peak-reducing (network tariffs) and peak-forming (wholesale prices) charging behaviour. Results based on real charging transactions from over 650 public charging stations (CS) in the Netherlands show that the segmented network tariff with flat energy prices results in more diverse load profiles with increasing aggregation compared to cost-optimized dispatch based on dynamic day-ahead prices. The average peak demand for charging with segmented network tariffs and flat energy prices is reduced by 49% and 29% compared to optimized charging under dynamic day-ahead energy prices and unoptimized (dumb) charging, respectively.</description>

      <title>Secure Synchronization of Heterogeneous Pulse-Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the synchronization of heterogeneous pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs), where some of the oscillators might be faulty or malicious. The oscillators interact through identical pulses at discrete instants and evolve continuously with different frequencies otherwise. Despite the presence of misbehaviors, benign oscillators aim to reach synchronization. To achieve this objective, two resilient synchronization protocols are developed in this paper by adapting the real-valued mean-subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm to pulse-based interactions. The first protocol relies on packet-based communication to transmit absolute frequencies, while the second protocol operates purely with pulses to calculate relative frequencies. In both protocols, each normal oscillator periodically counts the received pulses to detect possible malicious behaviors. By disregarding suspicious pulses from its neighbors, the oscillator updates both its phases and frequencies. The paper establishes sufficient conditions on the initial states and graph structure under which resilient synchronization is achieved in the PCO network. Specifically, the normal oscillators can either detect the presence of malicious nodes or synchronize in both phases and frequencies. Additionally, a comparison between the two algorithms reveals a trade-off between relaxed initial conditions and reduced communication burden.</description>

      <title>Multiplier analysis of Lurye systems with power signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipliers can be used to guarantee both the Lyapunov stability and input-output stability of Lurye systems with time-invariant memoryless slope-restricted nonlinearities. If a dynamic multiplier is used there is no guarantee the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. It has been suggested in the literature that without this guarantee such a system may be critically sensitive to time-varying exogenous signals including noise. We show that multipliers guarantee the power gain of the system to be bounded and quantifiable. Furthermore power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous systems have constant steady state. We illustrate the analysis with an example where the exogenous signal is a power signal with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Shortest Trajectory of a Dubins Vehicle with a Controllable Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a novel planar motion planning problem for a Dubins-Laser system that consists of a Dubins vehicle with an attached controllable laser. The vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary initial position and orientation, the objective is to steer the system so that a given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal trajectory and establish that the optimal trajectory for the Dubins-laser system is one out of a total of 16 candidates. Finally, we provide numerical insights that illustrate the properties characterized in this work.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear systems with contextual uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating and controlling safety-critical systems in uncertain environments necessitates probabilistic reachable sets of future state evolutions. The existing methods of computing probabilistic reachable sets normally assume that the uncertainties are independent of the state. However, this assumption falls short in many real-world applications, where uncertainties are state-dependent, referred to as contextual uncertainties. This paper formulates the problem of computing probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear states with contextual uncertainties by seeking minimum-volume polynomial sublevel sets with contextual chance constraints. The formulated problem cannot be solved by the existing sample-based approximation method since the existing methods do not consider the conditional probability densities. To address this, we propose a consistent sample approximation of the original problem by leveraging the conditional density estimation and resampling. The obtained approximate problem is a tractable optimization problem. Additionally, we prove the almost uniform convergence of the proposed sample-based approximation, showing that it gives the optimal solution almost consistently with the original ones. Through a numerical example, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches, highlighting its capability to significantly reduce the bias inherent in sample-based approximation without considering a conditional probability density.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Four Key Factors for Tire Force Control Allocation in 4WID-4WIS Electric Vehicles at Handling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-wheel independent drive and four-wheel independent steering (4WID-4WIS) configurations enhance control flexibility and dynamic performance potential for more integrated electric vehicles. This paper comprehensively analyzes the impacts of four key factors on tire force control allocation: vertical load estimation, actuator dynamic characteristics, tire force constraints, and wheel steering precision at handling limits. The study demonstrates that precise vertical load estimation enhances lateral force allocation accuracy. Additionally, the self-compensating effect of lateral tire forces minimizes the impact of small deviations in vertical load estimation on tire force control allocation. A novel control allocation method considering actuator dynamics is introduced, effectively improving yaw rate response and reducing tracking errors. Considering tire-road adhesion and actuator rate constraints, an innovative method to calculate the real-time attainable tire force volume is proposed based on the tire slip ratio and slip angle. Feedforward control with bump steer compensation is implemented to improve wheel steering precision and lateral tire force control accuracy. Matlab/Simulink and Carsim co-simulation results emphasize the importance of these key factors' individual impacts and combined effects. This analysis offers valuable insights for developing advanced tire force control allocation strategies in 4WID-4WIS electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode fault diagnosis datasets of gearbox under variable working conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gearbox is a critical component of electromechanical systems. The occurrence of multiple faults can significantly impact system accuracy and service life. The vibration signal of the gearbox is an effective indicator of its operational status and fault information. However, gearboxes in real industrial settings often operate under variable working conditions, such as varying speeds and loads. It is a significant and challenging research area to complete the gearbox fault diagnosis procedure under varying operating conditions using vibration signals. This data article presents vibration datasets collected from a gearbox exhibiting various fault degrees of severity and fault types, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. These faults are manually implanted into the gears or bearings through precise machining processes, which include health, missing teeth, wear, pitting, root cracks, and broken teeth. Several kinds of actual compound faults are also encompassed. The development of these datasets facilitates testing the effectiveness and reliability of newly developed fault diagnosis methods.</description>

      <title>NN-ETM: Enabling safe neural network-based event-triggering mechanisms for consensus problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In networked control applications, event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) reduce the communication load while ensuring performance guarantees. However, the design of ETMs is becoming increasingly complex, particularly for decentralized multi-agent and consensus setups, where the condition used to trigger communication might incorporate the agent's local information and the information received from neighbors. This typically results in ad-hoc solutions, which may only work for the consensus protocols under consideration. In this work, we aim to safely incorporate neural networks in the ETM to provide a general and flexible solution while ensuring guaranteed performance. To decouple the stability analysis of the consensus protocol from the abstraction of the neural network in the ETM, we first derive design criteria for the consensus and ETM pair, which allow independent analysis of each element under mild constraints. As a result, we propose NN-ETM, a novel ETM featuring a neural network, which provides an all-purpose solution to optimize communication in consensus problems while preserving the stability guarantees of the consensus protocol.</description>

      <title>Robust Fuel-Optimal Landing Guidance for Hazardous Terrain using Multiple Sliding Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any spacecraft landing mission, precision soft landing in a fuel-efficient way while also avoiding nearby hazardous terrain is of utmost importance. Very few existing literature have attempted addressing both the problems of precision soft landing and terrain avoidance simultaneously. To this end, an optimal terrain avoidance landing guidance (OTALG) was recently developed, which showed promising performance in avoiding the terrain while consuming near-minimum fuel. However, its performance significantly degrades in the face of external disturbances, indicating lack of robustness. In order to mitigate this problem, in this paper, a novel near fuel-optimal guidance law is developed to avoid terrain and land precisely and softly at the desired landing site, under atmospheric perturbations and thrust deviations and constraints. Expanding the OTALG formulation by using sliding mode control with multiple sliding surfaces (MSS), the presented guidance law, named `MSS-OTALG', improves in terms of precision soft landing accuracy. Further, the sliding parameter is designed to allow the lander to avoid terrain by leaving the trajectory enforced by the sliding mode, and eventually returning to it when the terrain avoidance phase is completed. And finally, the robustness of the MSS-OTALG is established by proving practical fixed-time stability. Extensive numerical simulations are also presented to showcase its performance in terms of terrain avoidance, low fuel consumption and accuracy of precision soft landing. Comparative studies against existing relevant literature validates a balanced trade-off of all these performance measures achieved by the developed MSS-OTALG.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Solution Uniqueness in Fixed-Point-Based Harmonic Power Flow Analysis with Converter-Interfaced Resources: Ex-post Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors of this paper proposed a method for the Harmonic Power-Flow (HPF) calculus in polyphase grids with widespread deployment of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). The HPF problem was formulated by integrating the hybrid nodal equations of the grid with a detailed representation of the CIDERs hardware, sensing, and controls as Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) systems, and solving the resulting mismatch equations using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method. This work introduces a novel problem formulation based on the fixed-point algorithm that, combined with the contraction property of the HPF problem, provides insights into the uniqueness of its solution. Notably, the effectiveness of the fixed-point formulation and the uniqueness of the solution are evaluated through numerical analyses conducted on a modified version of the CIGRE low-voltage benchmark microgrid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous estimation of the position, linear velocity and orientation of a rigid body using single bearing measurements. We introduce a Riccati observer-based estimator that fuses measurements from a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, a single body-frame vector observation (e.g., magnetometer), and a single bearing-to-landmark measurement to obtain the full vehicle's state (position, velocity, orientation). The proposed observer guarantees global exponential convergence under some persistency of excitation (PE) condition on the vehicle's motion. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Information Disclosure Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-player dynamic information design problem between a principal and a receiver -- a game is played between the two agents on top of a Markovian system controlled by the receiver's actions, where the principal obtains and strategically shares some information about the underlying system with the receiver in order to influence their actions. In our setting, both players have long-term objectives, and the principal sequentially commits to their strategies instead of committing at the beginning. Further, the principal cannot directly observe the system state, but at every turn they can choose randomized experiments to observe the system partially. The principal can share details about the experiments to the receiver. For our analysis we impose the truthful disclosure rule: the principal is required to truthfully announce the details and the result of each experiment to the receiver immediately after the experiment result is revealed. Based on the received information, the receiver takes an action when its their turn, with the action influencing the state of the underlying system. We show that there exist Perfect Bayesian equilibria in this game where both agents play Canonical Belief Based (CBB) strategies using a compressed version of their information, rather than full information, to choose experiments (for the principal) or actions (for the receiver). We also provide a backward inductive procedure to solve for an equilibrium in CBB strategies.</description>

      <title>IKSPARK: An Inverse Kinematics Solver using Semidefinite Relaxation and Rank Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental problem frequently occurred in robot control and motion planning. However, the problem is nonconvex because the kinematic map between the configuration and task spaces is generally nonlinear, which makes it challenging for fast and accurate solutions. The problem can be more complicated with the existence of different physical constraints imposed by the robot structure. In this paper, we develop an inverse kinematics solver named IKSPARK (Inverse Kinematics using Semidefinite Programming And RanK minimization) that can find solutions for robots with various structures, including open/closed kinematic chains, spherical, revolute, and/or prismatic joints. The solver works in the space of rotation matrices of the link reference frames and involves solving only convex semidefinite problems (SDPs). Specifically, the IK problem is formulated as an SDP with an additional rank-1 constraint on symmetric matrices with constant traces. The solver first solves this SDP disregarding the rank constraint to get a start point and then finds the rank-1 solution iteratively via a rank minimization algorithm with proven local convergence. Compared to other work that performs SDP relaxation for IK problems, our formulation is simpler, and uses variables with smaller sizes. We validate our approach via simulations on different robots, comparing against a standard IK method.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Density Control with Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control under uncertainty requires a good understanding and characterization of the noise affecting the system. This paper studies the problem of steering state distributions of dynamical systems subject to partially known uncertainties. We model the distributional uncertainty of the noise process in terms of Wasserstein ambiguity sets, which, based on recent results, have been shown to be an effective means of capturing and propagating uncertainty through stochastic LTI systems. To this end, we propagate the distributional uncertainty of the state through the dynamical system, and, using an affine feedback control law, we steer the ambiguity set of the state to a prescribed, terminal ambiguity set. We also enforce distributionally robust CVaR constraints for the transient motion of the state so as to reside within a prescribed constraint space. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a semi-definite program, which can be solved efficiently using standard off-the-shelf solvers. We illustrate the proposed distributionally-robust framework on a quadrotor landing problem subject to wind turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging an algebraic approach built on minimal realizations and conditional expectations in quantum probability, we propose a method to reduce the dimension of quantum filters while maintaining the correct distributions on the outcomes of interest. The method is presented for general quantum systems whose dynamics depend on measurement outcomes, hinges on a system-theoretic observability analysis, and is tested on prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>A new framework for constrained optimization via feedback control of Lagrange multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous-time analysis of existing iterative algorithms for optimization has a long history. This work proposes a novel continuous-time control-theoretic framework for equality-constrained optimization. The key idea is to design a feedback control system where the Lagrange multipliers are the control input, and the output represents the constraints. The system converges to a stationary point of the constrained optimization problem through suitable regulation. Regarding the Lagrange multipliers, we consider two control laws: proportional-integral control and feedback linearization. These choices give rise to a family of different methods. We rigorously develop the related algorithms, theoretically analyze their convergence and present several numerical experiments to support their effectiveness concerning the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>A Study of an Atomic Mobility Game With Uncertainty Under Prospect Theory</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a study of a mobility game with uncertainty in the decision-making of travelers and incorporate prospect theory to model travel behavior. We formulate a mobility game that models how travelers distribute their traffic flows in a transportation network with splittable traffic, utilizing the Bureau of Public Roads function to establish the relationship between traffic flow and travel time cost. Given the inherent non-linearities and complexity introduced by the uncertainties, we propose a smooth approximation function to estimate the prospect-theoretic cost functions. As part of our analysis, we characterize the best-fit parameters and derive an upper bound for the error. We then show the existence of an equilibrium and its its best-possible approximation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Robust Network Design: Formulations and Algorithms for Maximizing Algebraic Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing edge-weighted networks, whose robustness is characterized by maximizing algebraic connectivity, or the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. This problem is motivated by cooperative vehicle localization, where accurately estimating relative position measurements and establishing communication links are essential. We also examine an associated problem where every robot is limited by payload, budget, and communication to pick no more than a specified number of relative position measurements. The basic underlying formulation for these problems is nonlinear and is known to be NP-hard. Our approach formulates this problem as a Mixed Integer Semi-Definite Program (MISDP), later reformulated into a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) for obtaining optimal solutions using cutting plane algorithms. We introduce a novel upper-bounding algorithm based on principal minor characterization of positive semi-definite matrices and discuss a degree-constrained lower bounding formulation inspired by robust network structures. In addition, we propose a maximum cost heuristic with low computational complexity to identify high-quality feasible solutions for instances involving up to one hundred nodes. We show extensive computational results corroborating our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Regret Optimal Control for Uncertain Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider control of uncertain linear time-varying stochastic systems from the perspective of regret minimization. Specifically, we focus on the problem of designing a feedback controller that minimizes the loss relative to a clairvoyant optimal policy that has foreknowledge of both the system dynamics and the exogenous disturbances. In this competitive framework, establishing robustness guarantees proves challenging as, differently from the case where the model is known, the clairvoyant optimal policy is not only inapplicable, but also impossible to compute without knowledge of the system parameters. To address this challenge, we embrace a scenario optimization approach, and we propose minimizing regret robustly over a finite set of randomly sampled system parameters. We prove that this policy optimization problem can be solved through semidefinite programming, and that the corresponding solution retains strong probabilistic out-of-sample regret guarantees in face of the uncertain dynamics. Our method naturally extends to include satisfaction of safety constraints with high probability. We validate our theoretical results and showcase the potential of our approach by means of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Iterative Planning for Multi-agent Systems: An Application in Energy-Aware UAV-UGV Cooperative Task Site Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an iterative planning framework for multi-agent systems with hybrid state spaces. The framework uses transition systems to mathematically represent planning tasks and employs multiple solvers to iteratively improve the plan until computation resources are exhausted. When integrating different solvers for iterative planning, we establish theoretical guarantees on the mathematical framework to ensure recursive feasibility. The proposed framework enables continual improvement of solution optimality, efficiently using allocated computation resources. The proposed method is validated by applying it to an energy-aware UGV-UAV cooperative task site assignment. The results demonstrate the continual solution improvement while preserving real-time implementation ability compared to algorithms proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Age of Computing: A Metric of Computation Freshness in Communication and Computation Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication and computation cooperative networks (3CNs), timely computation is crucial but not always guaranteed. There is a strong demand for a computational task to be completed within a given time. The time taken involves both processing time and communication time. However, a measure of such timeliness in 3CNs is lacking. In this letter, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing (AoC), to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We develop two methods for calculating this metric, applicable to a wide range of 3CNs. These calculations are applied to a queue-theoretic system comprising a task-initiating source, a task-executing computational node and a communication link, resulting in the derivation of two expressions for the AoC. Then a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound are derived. Subsequently, we investigate the communication-computation tradeoff and the AoC-delay tradeoff. While our models are simpler than their real-world counterparts, they provide comprehensive insight in understanding computation freshness in 3CNs and the relationships between computing and communications.</description>

      <title>Safe Planning through Incremental Decomposition of Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical process that enables autonomous systems to safely navigate complex environments. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are an effective way to encode complex temporally extended objectives for trajectory planning in cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, planning from these specifications using existing techniques scale exponentially with the number of nested operators and the horizon of specification. Additionally, performance is exacerbated at runtime due to limited computational budgets and compounding modeling errors. Decomposing a complex specification into smaller subtasks and incrementally planning for them can remedy these issues. In this work, we present a way to decompose STL requirements temporally to improve planning efficiency and performance. The key insight in our work is to encode all specifications as a set of reachability and invariance constraints and scheduling these constraints sequentially at runtime. Our proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory synthesis techniques for both linear and non linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>When Robotics Meets Wireless Communications: An Introductory Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of ground Mobile Robots (MRs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the research community, industry, and society is growing fast. Many of these agents are nowadays equipped with communication systems that are, in some cases, essential to successfully achieve certain tasks. In this context, we have begun to witness the development of a new interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of robotics and communications. This research field has been boosted by the intention of integrating UAVs within the 5G and 6G communication networks. This research will undoubtedly lead to many important applications in the near future. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles to the development of this research area is that most researchers address these problems by oversimplifying either the robotics or the communications aspect. This impedes the ability of reaching the full potential of this new interdisciplinary research area. In this tutorial, we present some of the modelling tools necessary to address problems involving both robotics and communication from an interdisciplinary perspective. As an illustrative example of such problems, we focus in this tutorial on the issue of communication-aware trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning for Continuous State and Action MDPs under Average Cost Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For infinite-horizon average-cost criterion problems, there exist relatively few rigorous approximation and reinforcement learning results. In this paper, for such problems, we present several approximation and reinforcement learning results for Markov Decision Processes with standard Borel spaces. Toward this end, (i) we first provide a discretization based approximation method for fully observed Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with continuous spaces under average cost criteria, and we provide error bounds for the approximations when the dynamics are only weakly continuous (for asymptotic convergence of errors as the grid sizes vanish) or Wasserstein continuous (with a rate in approximation as the grid sizes vanish) under certain ergodicity assumptions. In particular, we relax the total variation condition given in prior work to weak continuity as well as Wasserstein continuity conditions. (ii) We provide synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning algorithms for continuous spaces via quantization (where the quantized state is taken to be the actual state in corresponding Q-learning algorithms presented in the paper), and establish their convergence; for the former we utilize a span semi-norm approach and for the latter we use a direct contraction approach. (iii) We finally show that the convergence is to the optimal Q values of the finite approximate models constructed via quantization, which implies near optimality of the arrived solution. Our Q-learning convergence results and their convergence to near optimality are new for continuous spaces, and the proof method is new even for finite spaces, to our knowledge.</description>

Abstract: The paper develops a methodology for the design of coherent equalizing filters for quantum communication channels. Given a linear quantum system model of a quantum communication channel, the aim is to obtain another quantum system which, when coupled with the original system, mitigates degrading effects of the environment.

      <description>arXiv:2310.06921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of neural networks in safety-critical control systems underscores the imperative need for rigorous methods to ensure the reliability and safety of these systems. This work introduces a novel approach employing hybrid zonotopes to compute the over-approximation of backward reachable sets for neural feedback systems with nonlinear plant models and general activation functions. Closed-form expressions as hybrid zonotopes are provided for the over-approximated backward reachable sets, and a refinement procedure is proposed to alleviate the potential conservatism of the approximation. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Controlling Large Electric Vehicle Charging Stations via User Behavior Modeling and Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) model that incorporates real-world constraints, such as slot power limitations, contract threshold overruns penalties, or early disconnections of electric vehicles (EVs). We propose a formulation of the problem of EVCS control under uncertainty, and implement two Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming approaches that leverage user-provided information, namely, Model Predictive Control and Two-Stage Stochastic Programming. The model addresses uncertainties in charging session start and end times, as well as in energy demand. A user's behavior model based on a sojourn-time-dependent stochastic process enhances cost reduction while maintaining customer satisfaction. The benefits of the two proposed methods are showcased against two baselines over a 22-day simulation using a real-world dataset. The two-stage approach demonstrates robustness against early disconnections by considering a wider range of uncertainty scenarios for optimization. The algorithm prioritizing user satisfaction over electricity cost achieves a 20% and 36% improvement in two user satisfaction metrics compared to an industry-standard baseline. Additionally, the algorithm striking the best balance between cost and user satisfaction exhibits a mere 3% relative cost increase compared to the theoretically optimal baseline - for which the nonanticipativity constraint is relaxed - while attaining 94% and 84% of the user satisfaction performance in the two used satisfaction metrics.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>
