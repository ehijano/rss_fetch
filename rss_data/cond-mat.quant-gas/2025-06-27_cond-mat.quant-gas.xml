      <title>Nonequilibrium quench dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates of microwave-shielded polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of homogeneous ultracold Bose gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules following a sudden quench of the scattering length at zero temperature. We calculate in particular the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and the pair correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long time scales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while they spread ballistically at long times.</description>

      <title>Energetic and Structural Properties of Two-Dimensional Trapped Mesoscopic Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate equal-mass spin-balanced two-component Fermi gases in which pairs of atoms with opposite spins interact via a short-range isotropic model potential. We probe the distinction between two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional harmonic confinement by tuning the effective range parameter within two-dimensional scattering theory. Our approach, which yields numerically exact energetic and structural properties, combines a correlated Gaussian basis-set expansion with the stochastic variational method. For systems containing up to six particles, we: 1) Present the ground- and excited-state energy spectra; 2) Study non-local correlations by analysing the one- and two-body density matrices, extracting from these the occupation numbers of the natural orbitals, the momentum distributions of atoms and pairs, and the molecular 'condensate fraction'; 3) Study local correlations by computing the radial and pair distribution functions. This paper extends current theoretical knowledge on the properties of trapped few-fermion systems as realised in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator in a gas of ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.</description>

      <title>Few-body bound states of bosonic mixtures in two-dimensional optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of bound states in a binary mixture of a few bosons in square optical lattices. Using the exact diagonalization method, we find that bound clusters of all available bosons can form. We provide a comprehensive numerical examination of these bound states for a wide range of repulsive intraspecies and attractive interspecies interactions. In contrast to binary mixtures in one-dimensional chains, we reveal that the binding energy of the clusters shows a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction strengths for small tunneling rates, developing a local minimum for intermediate attractive interactions. The findings of this work highlight the difference between the binding mechanisms of binary bosonic mixtures in one- and higher-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantized Chern-Simons Axion Coupling in Anomalous Floquet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Resonating Kagome Dimer coverings in Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Meson spectroscopy of exotic symmetries of Ising criticality in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry and criticality.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal state preparation for near-term quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry breaking in 1D spin chains and 1+1D field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1) ``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x, S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning. Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest. The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>
