      <title>The Mass Distribution of Stars Stripped in Binaries: The Effect of Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars stripped of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through binary interaction are thought to be responsible for both hydrogen-poor supernovae and the hard ionizing radiation observed in low-$Z$ galaxies. A population of these stars was recently observed for the first time, but their prevalence remains unknown. In preparation for such measurements, we estimate the mass distribution of hot, stripped stars using a population synthesis code that interpolates over detailed single and binary stellar evolution tracks. We predict that for a constant star-formation rate of $1 \,M_\odot$/yr and regardless of metallicity, a population contains $\sim$30,000 stripped stars with mass $M_{\rm strip}&gt;1M_\odot$ and $\sim$4,000 stripped stars that are sufficiently massive to explode ($M_{\rm strip}&gt;2.6M_\odot$). Below $M_{\rm strip}=5M_\odot$, the distribution is metallicity-independent and can be described by a power law with the exponent $\alpha \sim -2$. At higher masses and lower metallicity ($Z \lesssim 0.002$), the mass distribution exhibits a drop. This originates from the prediction, frequently seen in evolutionary models, that massive low-metallicity stars do not expand substantially until central helium burning or later and therefore cannot form long-lived stripped stars. With weaker line-driven winds at low metallicity, this suggests that neither binary interaction nor wind mass loss can efficiently strip massive stars at low metallicity. As a result, a "helium-star desert" emerges around $M_{\rm strip} =15\, M_\odot$ at $Z=0.002$, covering an increasingly large mass range with decreasing metallicity. We note that these high-mass stars are those that potentially boost a galaxy's He$^+$-ionizing radiation and that participate in the formation of merging black holes. This "helium-star desert" therefore merits further study.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of Low-Mass Pre-Main Sequence Stars in NGC 2264</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the angular momentum evolution of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars provides important insight into the interactions between Sun-like stars and their protoplanetary disks, and the timescales that govern disk dissipation and planet formation. We present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) of 254 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the ~3 Myr-old open cluster NGC 2264, measured using high-dispersion spectra from the WIYN 3.5m telescope's Hydra instrument. We combine these with literature values of temperature, rotation period, luminosity, disk classification, and binarity. We find some evidence that Weak-lined TTSs may rotate faster than their Classical TTS counterparts and that stars in binary systems may rotate faster than single stars. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation period to estimate the projected stellar radii of our sample stars, and then use a maximum likelihood modeling technique to compare our radii estimates to predicted values from stellar evolution models. We find that starspot-free models tend to underestimate the radii of the PMS stars at the age of the cluster, while models that incorporate starspots are more successful. We also observe a mass dependence in the degree of radius inflation, which may be a result of differences in the birthline location on the HR diagram. Our study of NGC 2264 serves as a pilot study for analysis methods to be applied to four other clusters ranging in age from 1 to 14 Myr, which is the timescale over which protoplanetary disks dissipate and planetary systems begin to form.</description>

      <title>The Temperature versus Orbital Period relation of AM CVns: Insights from their Donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 22 known AM~CVns with orbital periods ($P_{orb}$) larger than 35~min using multiwavelength public photometric data to estimate the effective temperature of the accreting white dwarf. We find an infrared (IR) excess in all systems when compared to a single blackbody, both when the disk should be extended and when it should be truncated by the accretor's magnetic field. This suggests a dominant contribution from the donor to the IR flux. When fitting two blackbodies, the temperature of the hot component decreases with $P_{orb}$, as expected by evolutionary models. Temperatures for systems with $35&lt;P_{orb}&lt;45~\text{min}$ are consistent with models. Systems with $P_{orb}\gtrsim45~\text{min}$ have higher temperatures than expected. The second blackbody temperature does not correlate with $P_{orb}$.</description>

      <title>Highly Polarized Type III Storm Observed with Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft observed a large coronal mass ejection (CME) on 5 September 2022, shortly before closest approach during the 13th PSP solar encounter. For several days following the CME, PSP detected a storm of Type III radio bursts. Stokes parameter analysis of the radio emission indicates that the Type III storm was highly circularly polarized. Left hand circularly polarized (LHC) emission dominated at the start of the storm, transitioning to right hand circularly polarized (RHC) emission at the crossing of the heliospheric current sheet on 6 September.
  We analyze the properties of this Type III storm. The drift rate of the Type IIIs indicates a constant beam speed of $\sim$0.1$c$, typical for Type III-producing electron beams. The sense of polarization is consistent with fundamental emission generated primarily in the $O$-mode.
  The stable and well organized post-CME magnetic field neatly separates the LHC- and RHC-dominated intervals of the storm, with minimal overlap between the senses of polarization. The proximity of PSP to the source region, both in radial distance and in heliographic longitude, makes this event an ideal case study to connect in situ plasma measurements with remote observations of radio emission.</description>

      <title>SoFT: Detecting and Tracking Magnetic Structures in the Solar Photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present SoFT: Solar Feature Tracking, a novel feature-tracking tool developed in Python and designed to detect, identify, and track magnetic elements in the solar atmosphere. It relies on a watershed segmentation algorithm to effectively detect magnetic clumps within magnetograms, which are then associated across successive frames to follow the motion of magnetic structures in the photosphere. Here, we study its reliability in detecting and tracking features under different noise conditions starting with real-world data observed with SDO/HMI and followed with simulation data obtained from the Bifrost numerical code to better replicate the movements and shape of actual magnetic structures observed in the Sun's atmosphere within a controlled noise environment.</description>

      <title>On the detectability and parameterisation of binary stars through spectral energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the characterization of binary star systems using Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), a technique increasingly essential with the rise of large-scale astronomical surveys. Binaries can emit flux at different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, making SEDs a valuable tool in identifying and characterising unresolved binary systems. However, fitting multi-component models to SEDs and recovering accurate stellar parameters remains challenging due to nonlinear fitting methods and inherent uncertainties in the data and the spectral models. In this work, a simplified approach was used to model stars as blackbodies and we tested the accuracy of parameter recovery from SEDs, particularly focusing on secondary stars. We explored a range of primary properties, filter sets and noise models. Special attention was given to two case studies: one examining the detection of unresolved binaries using Gaia XP spectra, and the other focusing on identifying hotter companions in binary systems using UV-IR SEDs. Although an analytic prescription for recoverability is not possible, we present a simplified model and the necessary Python tools to analyse any potential binary system. Finally, we propose using blackbody models as a baseline for error estimation in SED fitting, offering a potential method for measuring fitting errors and improving the precision of binary star characterisations.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05650v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05668v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen emission lines are routinely used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars. Despite the clear correlation between the accretion luminosity of a star and hydrogen line luminosities, the physical origin of these lines is still unclear, with magnetospheric accretion and magneto-centrifugal winds as the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra, we have analysed the SED and emission line spectra of five sources in order to determine their underlying photospheric properties, and to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We have fitted the SED of the five sources employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate $T_{eff}$, $R_{*}$, $M_{*}$ and $A(V)$ for each source. We have performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines, Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund, totalling $\ge 15$ lines. The FWHM and optical depth of the spectrally resolved lines have been studied in order to constrain the emission origin. The five sources all have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We have classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their effective temperature. Their hydrogen lines show broad profiles with FWHMs $\ge 200$ km s$^{-1}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with lower $n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high velocity component of each line, becoming optically thin in the low velocity component. This is consistent with emission from a magnetospheric accretion flow, and cannot be explained as originating in a magneto-centrifugal wind, or other line emission mechanisms thought to be present in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties of stars such as luminosity, surface temperature, distance, or mass are measured from observations. These physical properties are of paramount importance to understand how stars are born, live, and die in the universe near and far. This chapter discusses the basic concepts used by astronomers to derive key information about stars from the light they emit. We present through a pedagogical approach the methods required for determining stellar brightness (apparent and absolute magnitudes), surface temperature (via black-body radiation and spectral classification), and distance (using parallax and standard candles). We finally review techniques for estimating stellar mass and radius, including the use of binary star systems and stellar evolution models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, we have a sufficiently complete picture of what the Wolf--Rayet (WR) stars are. Predictions of stellar evolution theory are in a good agreement with their parameters, estimated from observational data using stellar atmospheres codes; predictions of population synthesis also agree well with number of known WR stars. This article provides an overview of the main historical milestones in the studies of WR stars, showing how we came to this understanding, and what questions are still unanswered.</description>

      <title>Non-local thermal transport impact on compressive waves in two-temperature coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observations of slow magnetoacoustic waves in solar coronal loops suggest that, in hot coronal plasma, heat conduction may be suppressed in comparison with the classical thermal transport model. Aims. We link this suppression with the effect of the non-local thermal transport that appears when the plasma temperature perturbation gradient becomes comparable to the electron mean free path. Moreover, we consider a finite time of thermalisation between electrons and ions, so that separate electron and ion temperatures can occur in the loop. Methods. We numerically compare the influence of the local and non-local thermal transport models on standing slow waves in one- and two-temperature coronal loops. To quantify our comparison, we use the period and damping time of the waves as commonly observed parameters. Results. Our study reveals that non-local thermal transport can result in either shorter or longer slow-wave damping times in comparison with the local conduction model due to the suppression of the isothermal regime. The difference in damping times can reach 80%. For hot coronal loops, we found that the finite equilibration between electron and ion temperatures results in up to 50% longer damping time compared to the one-temperature case. These results indicate that non-local transport will influence the dynamics of compressive waves across a broad range of coronal plasma parameters with Knudsen numbers (the ratio of mean-free-path to temperature scale length) larger than 1%. Conclusions. In the solar corona, the non-local thermal transport shows a significant influence on the dynamics of standing slow waves in a broad range of plasma parameters, while two-temperature effects come into play for hot and less dense loops.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Ionization Inside the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is the main chemical component of the solar plasma, and H-ionization determines basic properties of the first adiabatic exponent $\Gamma_1$. Hydrogen ionization remarkably differs from the ionization of other chemicals. Due to the large number concentration, H-ionization causes a very deep lowering of $\Gamma_1$, and the lowering profile appears to be strongly asymmetric and extends over almost the entire solar convective zone. The excited states in the hydrogen atom are modelled with the help of a partition function, which accounts the internal degrees of freedom of the composed particle. A temperature-dependent partition function with an asymptotic cut-off tail is deduced from a solution of the quantum mechanical problem of the hydrogen atom in the plasma. We present a numerical simulation of hydrogen ionization, calculated with two expressions for the partition function, Planck-Larkin (PL) and Starostin-Roerich (SR), respectively. The Hydrogen ionization is shifted toward higher temperature in the SR-case compared to the PL-case. Different models for excited states of the hydrogen atom may change $\Gamma_1$ by as much as $10^{-2}$. The behavior of the $\Gamma_1$ profiles for pure hydrogen resembles `twisted ropes' for the two considered models. This significantly affects the helium ionization and the position of the helium hump. This entanglement of H and He effect gives us a chance to study a role of excited states in the solar plasma.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of Raman-scattered C II lines at 7023 and 7054\r{A} in the symbiotic star V366 Carinae using GHOST at Gemini South. These faint features, originating from the C II doublet at ${\lambda}{\lambda}$ 1036 and 1037\r{A}, are rare and have been detected in only two other symbiotic stars: V1016 Cygni and RR Telescopii. Our findings showcase the exceptional sensitivity of GHOST to detect subtle spectral features and open the door to comparative studies of Raman-scattered C II features across these systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stellar Systems J0946 and V723 Monocerotis: A Study of Mass Gap Black Hole Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Rowan et al. reported the discovery of a black hole (BH) companion to J0946, following the misidentification of V723 Mon by Jayasinghe et al. as containing a "mass-gap" BH. This article reproduced Rowan and Jayasinghe's results on these systems by estimating stellar parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo solvers. We implemented Bayesian statistical modeling through the software ExoFit and PHysics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE). For J0946, we found a higher inclination of i = 72 degrees and a companion mass of 2.78 solar masses, lower than what Rowan estimated. V723 Mon's results aligned with recent estimates by El Badry et al., yielding an inclination of i = 74 degrees and a mass of 2.56 solar masses. We tested this method on stars from Gaia DR2 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive, agreeing with previous findings that these datasets do not exhibit strong indications of stellar-mass black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Classification of Periodic Variable Stars from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of known periodic variable stars has increased rapidly in recent years. As an all-sky transit survey, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) plays an important role in detecting low-amplitude variable stars. Using 2-minute cadence data from the first 67 sectors of TESS, we find 72,505 periodic variable stars. We used 19 parameters including period, physical parameters, and light curve (LC) parameters to classify periodic variable stars into 12 sub-types using random forest method. Pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries are distinguished mainly by period, LC parameters and physical parameters. GCAS, ROT, UV, YSO are distinguished mainly by period and physical parameters. Compared to previously published catalogs, 63,106 periodic variable stars (87.0$\%$) are newly classified, including 13 Cepheids, 27 RR Lyrae stars, $\sim$4,600 $\delta$ Scuti variable stars, $\sim$1,600 eclipsing binaries, $\sim$34,000 rotational variable stars, and about 23,000 other types of variable stars. The purity of eclipsing binaries and pulsation variable stars ranges from 94.2$\%$ to 99.4$\%$ when compared to variable star catalogs of Gaia DR3 and ZTF DR2. The purity of ROT is relatively low at 83.3$\%$. The increasing number of variables stars is helpful to investigate the structure of the Milky Way, stellar physics, and chromospheric activity.</description>

      <title>NLTE abundances of Eu for a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic Halo and Metal-poor Disk with 1D and &lt;3D&gt; models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of europium abundances in cool stars are essential for an enhanced understanding of the r-process mechanisms. We measure the abundance of Eu in solar spectra and a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and metal-poor disk, with the metallicities ranging from \GG{$-2.4$} to $-0.5$ dex, using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation. We compare these measurements with Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models to \GG{explore the impact of the NLTE corrections on the contribution of r-process site in Galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we use NLTE line formation, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic and spatial averages of 3D hydrodynamical ($&lt;$3D$&gt;$) model atmospheres to measure the abundance of Eu based on both the Eu II 4129 \AA\ and Eu II 6645 \AA\ lines for solar spectra and metal-poor stars. We find that \GG{for Eu II 4129 \AA\ line the NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.04 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and higher (0.07 dex) in \GG{$&lt;$3D$&gt;$} NLTE while} NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.01 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and lower (0.03 dex) in \GG{$&lt;$3D$&gt;$} NLTE for Eu II 6645 \AA\ line. Although the NLTE corrections for the Eu II $\lambda$ 4129 \AA\ and Eu II $\lambda$ 6645 \AA\ lines are opposite, the discrepancy between the abundances derived from these individual lines reduces after applying NLTE corrections, highlighting the critical role of NLTE abundance determinations. By comparing these measurements with Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, we find that the \G{amount of NLTE correction does not require significant change of the parameters for Eu production} in the GCE models.</description>

      <title>Radial velocities of narrow emission line components in the spectra of T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied rotational modulation of the radial velocities of narrow emission lines in four classical T Tauri stars. We found that the previously declared shift of the mean velocity of neutral and ionized helium lines relative to the mean radial velocity of the star is not associated with the inflow of accreted gas into the hotspot, since the radial velocity curves for lines with different velocity shifts should exhibit phase shifts relative to each other, while the observed phase shifts are absent within their uncertainties and do not correspond to the observed line velocity shifts. This means that the line shifts are not caused by the actual gas motion. For neutral helium lines, the shifts can be explained by the large optical thickness of the lines and the Stark effect at plasma parameters expected at the base of the accretion column of T Tauri stars.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Classical Cepheid's Physical Parameters from NIR Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent space-borne and ground-based observations provide photometric measurements as time series. The effect of interstellar dust extinction in the near-infrared range is only 10% of that measured in the V band. However, the sensitivity of the light curve shape to the physical parameters in the near-infrared is much lower. So, interpreting these types of data sets requires new approaches like the different large-scale surveys, which create similar problems with big data. Using a selected data set, we provide a method for applying routines implemented in R to extract most information of measurements to determine physical parameters, which can also be used in automatic classification schemes and pipeline processing. We made a multivariate classification of 131 Cepheid light curves (LC) in J, H, and K colors, where all the LCs were represented in 20D parameter space in these colors separately. Performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we got an orthogonal coordinate system and squared Euclidean distances between LCs, with 6 significant eigenvalues, reducing the 20-dimension to 6. We also estimated the optimal number of partitions of similar objects and found it to be equal to 7 in each color; their dependence on the period, absolute magnitude, amplitude, and metallicity are also discussed. We computed the Spearman rank correlations, showing that periods and absolute magnitudes correlate with the first three PCs significantly. The first two PC are also found to have a relationship with the amplitude, but the metallicity effects are only marginal. The method shown can be generalized and implemented in unsupervised classification schemes and analysis of mixed and biased samples. The analysis of our Classical Cepheid near-infrared LC sample showed that the J, H, K curves are insufficient for determination of stellar metallicity, with mass being the key factor shaping them.</description>

      <title>Fast time optical variability in Supergiant X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to investigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to supergiant X-ray binaries and to compare the general patterns of such variability with the Galactic population of other early-type stars. We analyzed a sample of 14 high-mass X-ray binaries with supergiant companions observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and 4 Be/X-ray binaries with persistent X-ray emission for comparison. All sources exhibit fast time aperiodic light variations. The shape of the periodogram is well described by a red noise component at intermediate frequencies ($\sim 1-10$ d$^{-1}$). At lower frequencies the noise level flattens while at higher frequencies the periodogram is dominated by white noise. We find that the patterns of variability of the massive companions in supergiant X-ray binaries agree with that of single early-type evolved stars in terms of the general shape of the periodograms. However, they exhibit higher amplitude at low frequencies and lower characteristic frequencies than Be/X-ray binaries. Unlike Be/X-ray binaries, supergiant X-ray binaries exhibit a total lack of coherent signals at high frequencies. Most sources have been analyzed over multiple TESS sectors, spanning a duration of 4 years. We do not find any significant variation over time in the low-frequency variability characteristics. This study reveals that stochastic low-frequency variability is a very common, if not ubiquitous, feature intrinsic to supergiant optical companions in X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Determining the acceleration regions of in situ electrons using remote radio and X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles in the heliosphere are produced by flaring processes on the Sun or shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. These particles are regularly detected remotely as electromagnetic radiation (X-rays or radio emission), which they generate through various processes, or in situ by spacecraft monitoring the Sun and the heliosphere. We aim to combine remote-sensing and in situ observations of energetic electrons to determine the origin and acceleration mechanism of these particles. Here, we investigate the acceleration location, escape, and propagation directions of electron beams producing radio bursts observed with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and, in situ electrons observed at Solar Orbiter (SolO) on 3 October 2023. These observations are combined with a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the electron acceleration locations and results from a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona in order to investigate the origin and connectivity of electrons observed remotely at the Sun to in situ electrons. We observed a type II radio burst with good connectivity to SolO, where a significant electron event was detected. However, type III radio bursts and Hard X-rays were also observed co-temporally with the elctron event but likely connected to SolO by different far-sided field lines. The injection times of the SolO electrons are simultaneous with both the onset of the type II radio burst, the group of type III bursts and the presence of a second HXR peak, however, the most direct connection to SolO is that of the type II burst location. The in situ electron spectra point to shock acceleration of electrons with a short-term connection to the source region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars are the most common endpoint of stellar evolution. Therefore, these old, numerous and compact objects provide valuable information on the late stages of stellar evolution, the physics of dense plasma and the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. The ESA Gaia space mission has revolutionized this research field, providing parallaxes and multi-band photometry for nearly 360,000 white dwarfs. Furthermore, this data, combined with spectroscopical and spectropolarimetric observations, have provided new information on their chemical abundances and magnetic fields. This large data set has raised new questions on the nature of white dwarfs, boosting our theoretical efforts for understanding the physics that governs their evolution and for improving the statistical analysis of their collective properties. In this article, I summarize the current state of our understanding of the collective properties of white dwarfs, based of detailed theoretical models and population synthesis studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are enigmatic transient events distinguished by a rapid rise in luminosity, a plateau in luminosity, and spectra which become redder with time. The best-observed system before, during, and after the outburst is V1309 Sco. We model a candidate V1309 Sco progenitor binary configuration (1.52+0.16Msun) using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code StarSmasher with a modified energy equation that implements flux-limited emission-diffusion radiative transport in a Lagrangian case. We developed an imaging technique allowing us to capture the flux an observer would measure. In this novel method, the outgoing radiative flux of each SPH particle in the observer's direction is attenuated by other particles along the path to the observer. We investigated how the light curve is affected in various models: with and without dust formation; constant, Planck, or Rosseland mean opacities; different donor star sizes; different companion star masses and types; radiative heating included in our modified energy equation; and different SPH simulation resolutions. The resulting evolution in bolometric luminosity and spectrum peak temperature is in good agreement with V1309 Sco observations. Our simulations rule out V1309 Sco models that do not assume dust formation.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the disk and the jet of a massive (proto)star. An ALMA view of IRAS20126+4104</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one of the best examples of disk+jet systems around an early B-type (proto)star, IRAS20126+4104. This object is an ideal target for resolution of its disk and the determination of its physical and kinematical structure. Despite its high declination, it has been possible to perform successful observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array at 1.4 mm in the continuum emission and a number of molecular tracers. The new data allow us to improve on previous similar observations and confirm the existence of a Keplerian accretion disk around a ~12 Msun (proto)star. From methyl cyanide, we derived the rotation temperature and column density as a function of disk radius. We also obtained a map of the same quantities for the jet using the ratio between two lines of formaldehyde. We use two simple models of the jet and the disk to estimate the basic geometrical and kinematical parameters of the two. We conclude that the disk is stable at all radii. We also estimate an accretion rate of ~0.001 Msun/yr. Our analysis confirms that the jet from IRAS20126+4104 is highly collimated, lies close to the plane of the sky, and expands with velocity increasing with distance. As expected, the gas temperature and column density peak in the bow shock. The disk is undergoing Keplerian rotation but a non-negligible radial velocity component is also present that is equal to ~40% of the rotational component. The disk is slightly inclined with respect to the line of sight and has a dusty envelope that absorbs the emission from the disk surface. This causes a slight distortion of the disk structure observed in high-density tracers. We also reveal a significant deviation from axial symmetry in the SW part of the disk, which might be caused by either tidal interaction with a nearby, lower-mass companion or interaction with the outflowing gas of the jet.</description>

      <title>Strong signature of right-circularly polarized photoionization close to the cyclotron line in the atmosphere of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields break the symmetry of the interaction of atoms with photons with different polarizations, yielding chirality and anisotropy properties on the medium. The dependence of the absorption spectrum on the polarization, phenomenon known as dichroism, is present in the atmosphere of magnetic white dwarfs. Its evaluation for processes in the continuum spectrum has been elusive so far due to the absence of appropriate ionization equilibrium models and incomplete data on photoionization cross sections. We have combined rigurous solutions to the equilibrium of atomic populations with approximate cross sections to calculate the absolute opacity origined from photoionizations in a magnetized hydrogen gas. We report the prediction of a strong right-handed circularly polarized absorption ($\chi^+$) formed bluewards the cyclotron resonance for fields from about 14 to several hundred megagauss. In lower energies to cyclotron fundamental, this absorption shows a deep trough respect to linear and left-handed circular polarizations that steepens with the field strength. The jump formed in $\chi^+$ is due to the confluence of a large number of photoionization continua produced by right-circularly polarized transitions, which start from atomic states with non-negative magnetic quantum number toward different Landau levels.</description>

Abstract: Context. Understanding the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Milky Way requires precise identification of clusters that form binary or multiple systems. Such systems offer valuable insight into the dynamical processes and interactions that influence cluster evolution. Aims. This study aims to identify and classify star clusters in the Milky Way as part of double or multiple systems. Specifically, we seek to detect clusters that form gravitationally bound pairs or groups of clusters and distinguish between different types of interactions based on their physical properties and spatial distributions. Methods. We used the extensive star cluster database of Hunt &amp; Reffert (2023, 2024), which includes 7167 clusters. By estimating the tidal forces acting on each cluster through the tidal factor (TF), and considering only close neighbours (within 50 pc), we identified a total of 2170 star clusters forming part of double and multiple systems. Pairs were classified as Binaries (B), Capture pairs (C), or Optical pairs (O/Oa) based on proper motion distributions, cluster ages, and color-magnitude diagrams. Results. Our analysis identified 617 paired systems, which were successfully classified using our scheme. Additionally, we found 261 groups of star clusters, each with three or more members, further supporting the presence of multiple systems within the Milky Way that exhibit significant tidal interactions. Conclusions. The method presented provides an improved approach for identifying star clusters that share the same spatial volume and experience notable tidal interactions.</description>

Abstract: The birth mass function of neutron stars encodes rich information about supernova explosions, double star evolution, and properties of matter under extreme conditions. To date, it has remained poorly constrained by observations, however. Applying probabilistic corrections to account for mass accreted by recycled pulsars in binary systems to mass measurements of 90 neutron stars, we find that the birth masses of neutron stars can be described by a unimodal distribution that smoothly turns on at $\mathbf{\unit[1.1]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$, peaks at $\mathbf{\approx \unit[1.27]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$, before declining as a steep power law. Such a ``turn-on" power-law distribution is strongly favoured against the widely-adopted empirical double-Gaussian model at the $\mathbf{3\sigma}$ level. The power-law shape may be inherited from the initial mass function of massive stars, but the relative dearth of massive neutron stars implies that single stars with initial masses greater than $\mathbf{\approx \unit[18]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$ do not form neutron stars, in agreement with the absence of massive red supergiant progenitors to supernovae.</description>

      <title>The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05535</link>

Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16$-$262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old ($\sim$34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio $\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with $\alpha-$viscosity $\lesssim10^{-4}$. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at $\sim$30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values -- high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below O(10) -- a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions -- high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra (R=24,000) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features -- we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Electron Acceleration and the 'Ankle' Spectral Feature in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons are accelerated to high, non-thermal energies during explosive energy-release events in space, such as magnetic reconnection. However, the properties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly associated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study utilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and spectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV) electrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This event provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized by X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field directly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation period. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were clearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed away from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly from the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons deviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an "ankle" feature similar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of "ankle" electrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the separatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations. Further analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated from the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during transport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at the X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Dependence of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar metallicity ([Fe/H] and [M/H]) dependence of giant planets around M dwarfs by comparing the metallicity distribution of 746 field M dwarfs without known giant planets with a sample of 22 M dwarfs hosting confirmed giant planets. All metallicity measurements are homogeneously obtained through the same methodology based on the near-infrared spectra collected with a single instrument SpeX mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that 1) giant planets favor metal-rich M dwarfs at a 4-5$\sigma$ confidence level, depending on the band of spectra used to derive metallicity; 2) hot ($a/R_\ast\leq 20$) and warm ($a/R_\ast&gt; 20$) Jupiters do not show a significant difference in the metallicity distribution. Our results suggest that giant planets around M and FGK stars, which are already known to prefer metal-rich hosts, probably have a similar formation channel. In particular, hot and warm Jupiters around M dwarfs may have the same origin as they have indistinguishable metallicity distributions. With the refined stellar and planetary parameters, we examine the stellar metallicities and the masses of giant planets where we find no significant correlation. M dwarfs with multi-giant planets as well as mid-to-late type M stars hosting gas giants do not show an apparent preference to higher metallicities.</description>

      <title>A multi-technique detection of an eccentric giant planet around accelerating star HD 57625</title>

Abstract: The synergy between different detection methods is a key asset in exoplanetology, allowing for both precise characterization of detected exoplanets and robust constraints even in the case of non-detection. Recently, the interplay between imaging, radial velocities and astrometry has produced significant advancements in exoplanetary science. We report a first result of an ongoing survey performed with SHARK-NIR, the new high-contrast near-infrared imaging camera at the Large Binocular Telescope, in parallel with LBTI/LMIRCam in order to detect planetary companions around stars with significant proper motion anomaly. In this work we focus on HD 57625, a F8 star for which we determine a $4.8^{+3.7}_{-2.9}$Ga age, exhibiting significant astrometric acceleration and for which archival radial velocities hint at the presence of a previously undetected massive long-period companion. We analyse the imaging data we collected with SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam in synergy with the available public SOPHIE radial velocity time series and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. With this joint multi-technique analysis, we aim at characterizing the companion responsible for the astrometric and radial velocity signals. The imaging observations result in a non-detection, indicating the companion to be in the substellar regime. This is confirmed by the synergic analysis of archival radial velocity and astrometric measurements resulting in the detection of HD 57625 b, a ${8.43}_{-0.91}^{+1.10}$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planetary companion with an orbital separation of ${5.70}_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$au and ${0.52}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$ eccentricity. HD 57625 b joins the small but growing population of giant planets in outer orbits with true mass determination provided by the synergic usage of multiple detection methods, proving once again the importance of multi-technique analysis in providing robust characterization of planetary companions.</description>

      <title>Alfven pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>

Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfven pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. Using perturbation theory and the solution found for the case of a homogeneous in a cross section magnetic tube, the electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfven wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e. accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined. For the chromospheric footpoints of the magnetic loops, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decay, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Inelastic H + H^+_3 Collision rates and their impact in the determination of the excitation temperature of H^+_3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In dffuse interstellar clouds the excitation temperature derived from the lowest levels of H+3 is systematically lower than that derived from H2. The differences may be attributed to the lack of state-specific formation and destruction rates of H+ 3 needed to thermalize the two species. Aims. In this work, we want to check the role of rotational excitation collisions of H+3 with atomic hydrogen on its excitation temperature. Methods. A time independent close-coupling method is used to calculate the state-to-state rate coefficients, using a very accurate and full dimensional potential energy surface recently developed for H+4. A symmetric top approach is used to describe a frozen H+3 as equilateral triangle. Results. Rotational excitation collision rate coefficients of H+3 with atomic Hydrogen have been derived in a temperature range appropriate to diffuse interstellar conditions up to (J; K; ?) = (7; 6; +) and (J; K; ?) = (6; 4; +) for its ortho and para forms. This allows to have a consistent set of collisional excitation rate coefficients and to improve the previous study where these contributions were speculated. Conclusions. The new state-specific inelastic H+3 + H rate coeffcients yield differences up to 20% in the excitation temperature, and their impact increases with decreasing molecular fraction. We also confirm the impact of chemical state-to-state destruction reactions in the excitation balance of H+3 , and that reactive H + H+3 collisions are also needed to account for possible further ortho to para transitions</description>

      <title>KIC 7914906: An Eclipsing Heartbeat Star with Tidally Excited Oscillations and Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti Hybrid Pulsations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the eclipsing Heartbeat Star KIC 9704906 with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) and gamma Doradus/delta Scuti hybrid pulsations. The derived parameters show that it has an orbital period of $P$=8.7529108(1) days, a high eccentricity of $e$=0.467(3), and a high inclination of $i$=78$^{\circ}$.81(6). The mass ratio $q$=0.981(5), the relative radii (radius divided by semi-major axis) $r_1$=0.0639(2), and $r_2$=0.0715(4) indicate that the secondary component has a less mass and a larger radius, and may have evolved off the main sequence. The eight derived TEO candidates, $n$ = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 40, and 44 harmonics, are consistent with or close to the dominant spherical harmonic $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$, assuming that the spin and orbital axes are aligned, and the pulsations are adiabatic and standing waves. We also identify ten independent frequency candidates, but one of them, $\mathit{f_{7}}$, is more like a modulation of a quasi-periodic signal and the orbits. According to the g-mode frequencies, we find that the rotation period of one component is 11.52(29) days. Although the masses and radii cannot be further constrained due to the lack of sufficient high-precision spectra, the fascinating phenomena in the Fourier spectra are evident and valuable in this system.</description>

      <title>Millinovae: A New Class of Transient Supersoft X-ray Sources without a Classical Nova Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some accreting binary systems containing a white dwarf (such as classical novae or persistent supersoft sources) are seen to emit low-energy X-rays with temperatures of ~10^6 K and luminosities exceeding 10^35 erg/s. These X-rays are thought to originate from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface, either caused by a thermonuclear runaway (classical novae) or a high mass-accretion rate that sustains steady nuclear burning (persistent sources). The discovery of transient supersoft X-rays from ASASSN-16oh challenged these ideas, as no clear signatures of mass ejection indicative of a classical nova eruption were detected, and the origin of these X-rays remains controversial. It was unclear whether this star was one of a kind or representative of a larger, as yet undiscovered, group. Here, we present the discovery of 29 stars located in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds exhibiting long-duration, symmetrical optical outbursts similar to that seen in ASASSN-16oh. We observed one of these objects during an optical outburst and found it to be emitting transient supersoft X-rays, while no signatures of mass ejection (indicative of a classical nova eruption) were detected. We therefore propose that these objects form a homogeneous group of transient supersoft X-ray sources, which we dub ``millinovae'' because their optical luminosities are approximately a thousand times fainter than those of ordinary classical novae.</description>

      <title>Fe I 6173 {\AA} Emission During White-Light Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 2017 and 2024, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed numerous white-light solar flares (WLFs). HMI spectro-polarimetric observations of certain WLFs, in particular the X9.3 flare of September 6, 2017, reveal one or more locations within the umbra or along the umbra/penumbra boundary of the flaring active region where the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line briefly goes into full emission, indicating significant heating of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. For five flares featuring Fe I 6173 {\AA} line-core emission, we perform spectro-polarimetric analysis using HMI 90-second-cadence Stokes data. Line-core emission is observed to last for a single 90 s frame and is either concurrent with or followed by an increase in the line continuum intensity lasting one to two frames (90 s - 180 s). This is followed by a smooth decay to pre-flare conditions over the next three to twenty minutes. Additionally, permanent changes to the Stokes Q, U, and/or V profiles were observed, indicating long-lasting non-transient changes to the photospheric magnetic field. These emissions coincided with local maxima in hard X-ray emission observed by the Konus instrument onboard the Wind spacecraft, as well as local maxima in the time derivative of soft X-ray emission observed by GOES satellites. Comparison of the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line profile synthesis for the ad-hoc heating of the initial empirical VAL-S umbra model and quiescent Sun (VAL-C-like) model indicates that the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line emission in the white-light flare kernels could be explained by the strong heating of initially cool photospheric regions.</description>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>History of the Observation of Stars</title>

Abstract: There are about 6000 stars, that can be seen with the naked eye and have been observed for centuries for various purposes. More modern investigations using advanced telescopes show that our Milky Way, a quite common galaxy, consists of about 100 -- 400 billion stars. And, it is estimated that there are between 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe -- all of them consist mostly of stars, and sending observable signals which also represents nothing more than a superposition of the light of individual stars. So we can conclude that the most common observable objects in the Universe are $\textit{stars}$.
  In this chapter, we focus on the long history of the observation of stars (compared to studies in other fields of science) to find out more about the nature of these objects.</description>

      <title>On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov &amp; Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Topology of quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs and associated Ultraviolet brightenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quiet-Sun Ellerman bombs (QSEBs) are small-scale magnetic reconnection events in the lower atmosphere of the quiet Sun. Recent work has shown that a small percentage of them can occur co-spatially and co-temporally to ultraviolet (UV) brightenings in the transition region. We aim to understand how the magnetic topologies associated with closely occurring QSEBs and UV brightenings can facilitate energy transport and connect these events. We used high-resolution H-beta observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and detected QSEBs using k-means clustering. We obtained the magnetic field topology from potential field extrapolations using spectro-polarimetric data in the photospheric Fe I 6173 A line. To detect UV brightenings, we used coordinated and co-aligned data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and imposed a threshold of 5 sigma above the median background on the (IRIS) 1400 A slit-jaw image channel. We identify four distinct magnetic configurations that associate QSEBs with UV brightenings, including a simple dipole configuration and more complex fan-spine topologies with a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point. In the fan-spine topology, the UV brightenings occur near the 3D null point, while QSEBs can be found close to the footpoints of the outer spine, the inner spine, and the fan surface. We find that the height of the 3D null varies between 0.2 Mm to 2.6 Mm, depending on the magnetic field strength in the region. We note that some QSEBs and UV brightenings, though occurring close to each other, are not topologically connected with the same reconnection process. We find that the energy released during QSEBs falls in the range of 10^23 to 10^24 ergs. This study shows that magnetic connectivity and topological features, like 3D null points, are crucial in linking QSEBs in the lower atmosphere with UV brightenings in the transition region.</description>

      <title>SN 2019odp: A Massive Oxygen-Rich Type Ib Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze observations of the Type Ib supernova (SN) 2019odp (a.k.a ZTF19abqwtfu) covering epochs within days of the explosion to the nebular phase at 360 d post-explosion. We discuss them in the context of recombination cooling emission for the early excess emission and consider progenitor models based on the nebular phase spectra. Our observations include photometric observations mainly in the optical and low to medium-resolution spectroscopic observations covering the complete observable time-range. We expand on existing methods to derive oxygen mass estimates from nebular phase spectroscopy. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the presence of He in the SN ejecta and we thus (re)classify it as a Type Ib supernova. From the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve we estimate a high ejecta mass $M_\text{ej} \sim 4 - 7~M_\odot$. The high ejecta mass, large nebular [O I]/[Ca II] line flux ratio ($1.2 - 1.9$) and an oxygen mass above $\gtrapprox 0.5\, M_\odot$ point towards a progenitor with pre-explosion mass higher than $18\,M_\odot$. The compact nature of the progenitor ($\lesssim 10\,R_\odot$) suggests a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as progenitor.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>
