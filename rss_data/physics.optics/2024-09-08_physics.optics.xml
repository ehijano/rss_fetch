      <title>Controlling Raman enhancement in particle-aperture hybrid nanostructures by interlayer spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show how surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) features can be fine-tuned in optically active substrates made of layered materials. To demonstrate this, we used DNA-assisted lithography (DALI) to create substrates with silver bowtie nanoparticle-aperture pairs and then coated the samples with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. By varying the spacing between the aperture and particle layer, we were able to control the strength of the interlayer coupling between the plasmon resonances of the apertures and those of the underlying bowtie particles. The changes in the resulting field enhancements were confirmed by recording the Raman spectra of R6G from the substrates, and the experimental findings were supported with finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations including reflection/extinction and near-field profiles.</description>

      <title>Multi-color solitons and frequency combs in microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-color solitons that are parametrically created in dual-pumped microresonators generate interleaved frequency combs that can be used to obtain combs at new frequencies and when synchronized can be used for low-noise microwave generation and potentially as an element in a chip-scale clockwork. Here, we first derive three-wave equations that describe multi-color solitons that appear in microresonators with a nearly quartic dispersion profile. These solitons are characterized by a single angular group velocity and multiple angular phase velocities. We then use these equations to explain the interleaved frequency combs that are observed at the output of the microresonator. Finally, we used these equations to describe the experimentally-observed soliton-OPO effect. In this effect, the pump frequency comb interacts nonlinearly with a signal frequency comb to create an idler frequency comb in a new frequency range, analogous to an optical parametric oscillation (OPO) process. We determine the conditions under which we expect this effect to occur. We anticipate that the three-wave equations and their extensions will be of use in designing new frequency comb systems and determining their stability and noise performance.</description>

      <title>Mixing Skyrmions and Merons in Topological Quasicrystals of Evanescent Optical Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic skyrmion and meron lattices are structured light fields with topologically protected textures, analogous to magnetic skyrmions and merons. Here, we report the theoretical existence of mixed skyrmion and meron quasicrystals in an evanescent optical field. Topological quasiperiodic tilings of even and odd point group symmetries are demonstrated in both the electric field and spin angular momentum. These quasicrystals contain both skyrmions and merons of N\'eel-type topology. Interestingly, the quasiperiodic tilings are in agreement with the observations of quasiperiodic arrangements of carbon nanoparticles in water driven by ultrasound, and pave the way towards engineering hybrid topological states of light which may have potential applications in optical manipulation, metrology and information processing.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifting of light via multiple ultrasound waves in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions to describe how light is frequency-shifted when interacting with ultrasound within scattering media, due to the modulation of the refractive index induced by the ultrasound pressure waves. The model is validated through Monte Carlo simulations, works for high ultrasound pressures, and allows for many simultaneous ultrasound waves or frequency components, which is important due to the non-linear propagation effects in tissue. We also provide critical insights into how the ultrasound properties can be optimized for an enhanced efficiency of the light to be frequency-shifted, facilitating applications in ultrasound optical tomography and other photonic diagnostic techniques.</description>

      <title>Phonon-polariton Bragg generation at the surface of silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are known to emerge at the surfaces of solids under IR irradiation at frequencies close to the optical phonon resonance. Metal, patterned on the top of the polariton-active surface, locally blocks the excitation of the surface waves due to plasmonic screening and can be used for the design of wave patterns. We excite the polaritonic waves at the surface of SiC under the irradiation of a CO$_2$ laser ($\lambda\sim10$ $\mu$m) and visualize them using apertureless near-field interference scanning probe microscopy. From the near-field scans in the vicinity of the gold film periodical strip structures, we identify the Bragg scattering (diffraction) outside the lattice with the contribution from separate strips coherently summed up, provided that the wavelength matching condition is fulfilled. The observed phenomena agree with the wavefield calculations. Our observations demonstrate the potential of metal-patterned silicon carbide for the fabrication of on-chip polaritonic IR circuits.</description>

      <title>Water-induced high-performance quantum-dot light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solution-processed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are appealing for their potential in the low-cost fabrication of large-area devices. However, the limited performance of solution-processed blue LEDs, particularly their short operation lifetime, is hindering their practical use in display technologies. Here, we demonstrate that trace water in device, previously considered detrimental to most solution-processed LEDs, dramatically enhances the performance of quantum-dot LEDs (QLEDs). This breakthrough stems from our comprehensive mechanism investigations into the positive ageing phenomenon, a long-standing puzzle in the QLED field. Our findings reveal that water passivation on the surface of electron-transport layers, which are composed of zinc-oxide-based nanoparticles, improves charge transport and enhances exciton radiative recombination during device operation. Combined with the advanced top-emitting architecture, our blue QLEDs achieve a high current efficiency of 35.5 cd A-1, a blue index (colour coordinate corrected current efficiency) of over 470 cd A-1 CIEy-1, and unprecedented stability, with an extrapolated T95 lifetime (at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m-2) of 287 hours. Our work may inspire further exploration into surface passivation of nanocrystalline functional layers, critical for the advancement of emerging solution-processed optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Snapshot of Relativistic Motion: Visualizing the Terrell Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental visualization of the Terrell effect, an optical phenomenon predicted in 1959 by Roger Penrose and James Terrell, which reveals that the Lorentz contraction of a moving object is not visible in a snapshot photograph. Using fs-laser pulses and a gated intensified camera that allows gating times as short as 300 ps, we achieve a virtual reduction of the speed of light to less than 2 m/s, enabling the visualisation of relativistically moving objects in real time. By capturing light reflected from deliberately Lorentz-contracted objects, our setup effectively reconstructs their visual appearance. This didactic visualization not only commemorates the centennial of Anton Lampa's seminal 1924 paper on relativistic length contraction but also provides the first experimental evidence of the Terrell effect in a laboratory setup. Our results comprise detailed relativistic illustrations, simulations and photographic snapshots of a sphere and a cube, which are animated to velocities close to the speed of light, revealing the apparent rotation effect and the distortion predicted by relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Super-Resolution Imaging Without Prior Knowledge Using a Programmable Spatial-Mode Sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an imaging system tasked with estimating the angular distance between two incoherently-emitting sub-Rayleigh-separated point sources, without any prior knowledge of the centroid or the constellation and with a fixed collected-photon budget. It was shown theoretically that splitting the optical recording time into two stages -- focal-plane direct imaging to obtain a pre-estimate of the centroid, and using that estimate to center a spatial-mode sorter followed by photon detection of the sorted modes -- can achieve 10 to 100 times lower mean squared error in estimating the separation. In this paper, we demonstrate this in proof-of-concept, using a programmable mode sorter we have built using multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) using a reflective spatial-light modulator (SLM) in an emulated experiment where we use a single coherent source to characterize the MPLC to electronically piece together the signature from two closely-separated quasi-monochromatic incoherent emitters.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the Coherence Properties of a Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we aim to clarify theoretically the spatial coherence properties of the x-ray beam in the focal plane after interaction with a variable line space (VLS) grating. Assuming that the VLS grating is oriented horizontally, we are interested in the coherence properties of the beam in the vertical dispersion direction. We first consider a fully spatially coherent x-ray beam illuminating the grating. We show that the spatial coherence properties in the focal plane depend on the bandwidth of the incoming radiation. Being fully spatially coherent up to the VLS grating, the spatial coherence properties degrade in the focal plane of the VLS grating. We attribute this to coupling of the spatial and frequency components in the focal plane of the grating. Next, we examine partially coherent x-ray beams incident on a VLS grating. We assume that this radiation is of the Gaussian Schell-model type and obtain an analytical expression for the spatial coherence properties of the beam in the focal plane of the VLS grating for such a field. Next, we consider a monochromator setting that is provided by installing slits in the focal plane of the VLS grating and examine the degree of coherence in this case. Finally, we evaluate the degree of coherence at different apertures of the exit slits, assuming coherent illumination of the grating and a bandwidth of 1.7 10^{-4}.</description>

      <title>A MEMS-based terahertz broadband beam steering technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-level tunable reflection array wide-angle beam scanning method is proposed to address the limited bandwidth and small scanning angle issues of current terahertz beam scanning technology. In this method, a focusing lens and its array are used to achieve terahertz wave spatial beam control, and MEMS mirrors and their arrays are used to achieve wide-angle beam scanning. The 1~3 order terahertz MEMS beam scanning system designed based on this method can extend the mechanical scanning angle of MEMS mirrors by 2~6 times, when tested and verified using an electromagnetic MEMS mirror with a 7mm optical aperture and a scanning angle of 15{\deg} and a D-band terahertz signal source. The experiment shows that the operating bandwidth of the first-order terahertz MEMS beam scanning system is better than 40GHz, the continuous beam scanning angle is about 30{\deg}, the continuous beam scanning cycle response time is about 1.1ms, and the antenna gain is better than 15dBi at 160GHz. This method has been validated for its large bandwidth and scalable scanning angle, and has potential application prospects in terahertz dynamic communication, detection radar, scanning imaging, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Selective Passive Tuning of Cavity Resonance by Mode Index Engineering of the Partial Length of a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavities in large-scale photonic integrated circuits often suffer from a wider distribution of resonance frequencies due to fabrication errors. It is crucial to adjust the resonances of cavities using post-processing methods to minimize the frequency distribution. We have developed a concept of passive tuning by manipulating the mode index of a portion of a microring cavity. Through analytical studies and numerical experiments, we have found that depositing a thin film of dielectric material on top of the cavity or etching the material enables us to fine-tune the resonances and minimize the frequency distribution. This versatile method allows for the selective tuning of each cavity's resonance in a large set of cavities in a single fabrication step, providing robust passive tuning in large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Furthermore, this method can be applied and explored in various cavities and different material configurations.</description>

      <title>Specific Nucleic Acid Detection Using a Nanoparticle Hybridization Assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple methods to detect biomolecules including specific nucleic acid sequences have received renewed attention since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus pandemic. Notably, biomolecule detection that uses some form of signal amplification will have some form of amplification-related error, which in the polymerase chain reaction involves mispriming and subsequent signal amplification in the no template control, ultimately providing a limit of detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the detection of a DNA target sequence without molecular or chemical signal amplification that avoids amplification errors, a gold nanoparticle aggregation assay was developed and tested. Two primers bracketing a 94 base pair target sequence from SARS-CoV-2 were conjugated to 10 nm diameter gold nanoparticles by the salt aging method, with conjugation and primer-target hybridization confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and nanospectrophotometry. Upon mixing of both conjugated nanoparticles with target, a surface plasmon resonance shift of 6 nm was observed, and lower electrophoretic mobility of a band containing both DNA fluorescence and gold absorption signals. This did not occur in the presence of a control DNA molecule of the same size and composition as the target but with a randomly scrambled base position. Nanoparticle tracking at 30 frames per second using a sensitive darkfield microscope revealed a lower measured diffusion coefficient of scattering objects in the target mixture than in the control mixture or with bare gold nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Randomness in quantum random number generator from vacuum fluctuations with source-device-independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application for random numbers is ubiquitous. We experimentally build a well-studied quantum random number generator from homodyne measurements on the quadrature of the vacuum fluctuations. Semi-device-independence in this random number generator is usually obtained using phase modulators to shift the phase of the laser and obtain random sampling from both X and P quadrature measurements of the vacuum state in previous implementations. We characterize the experimental parameters for optimal performance of this source-device independent quantum random number generator by measuring the two quadratures concurrently using two homodyne detectors. We also study the influence of these parameters on randomness, which can be extracted based on Shannon entropy and von Neumann entropy, which correspond to an eavesdropper listening to classical and quantum side information, respectively.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of a Grover-Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a low-resource and robust optical implementation of the four-dimensional Grover coin, a four-port linear-optical scatterer that augments the low dimensionality of a regular beam-splitter. While prior realizations of the Grover coin required a potentially unstable ring-cavity to be formed, this version of the scatterer does not exhibit any internal interference. When this Grover coin is placed in another system, it can be used for interferometry with a higher-dimensional set of optical field modes. In this case, we formed a Grover-Michelson interferometer, which results when the traditional beam-splitter of a Michelson interferometer is replaced with a four-port Grover coin. This replacement has been shown to remove a phase parameter redundancy in the original Michelson system, now allowing continuous tuning of the shape and slope of the interference pattern. We observed an intensity interferogram with $97\%$ visibility and a phase sensitivity more than an order of magnitude larger than a regular Michelson interferometer. Because this device is readily formed with nearly the same number of optomechanical resources as a Michelson interferometer, but can outperform it drastically in phase delay evaluation, it has a great potential to improve many interferometric sensing and control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wavefront quality demands tighten on space systems for applications such as astronomy and laser communication, mounting small optics such that the wavefront is undisturbed, positioning is adjustable and the design is producible, while surviving harsh space environments, is a continuing challenge. We designed multiple candidate flexure mounts to support small optics (up to 50 mm diameter, and over 100 grams) to survive the qualification and acceptance tests of small spacecraft and units as defined in ISO 19683 and a mounting structure which is adjustable in decenter [+/-0.5mm], tip/tilt +/-0.5deg, and piston [+/-0.25mm]. We will present design details along with measurements showing less than approximately lambda/10 wavefront contribution from the optic bonding process, along with thermal and multi-axis vibration test data showing the mounted optics survived the acceptance testing loads and are suitable for operation in a wide range of harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Triply Resonant Electro-Optic Frequency Comb in Lithium Tantalate</title>

Abstract: Integrated frequency comb generators based on Kerr parametric oscillation have led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, LiDAR, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with &gt;2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband localization of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide</title>

Abstract: Localized optical field enhancement enables strong light-matter interactions necessary for efficient manipulation and sensing of light. Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.</description>

      <title>Optical refractive index and spacetime geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical mechanics and geometrical optics are deeply connected with each other. In this work, we generalize the analogy between these two disciplines to relativistic conditions. Using this analogy, we are able to make light follow the orbits of massive or massless particles in gravitational field, by designing a particular optical medium with a prescribed refractive index profile according to spacetime geometry. Furthermore, we build the dictionary that connects optical refractive index and spacetime metric, thus extending F = ma optics to the relativistic limit. The results shed light on the equivalence between the dielectric properties of optical media and the geometric structure of spacetime.</description>
