      <title>How an AI-ready National Data Library would help UK science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a technical vision for key enabling elements for the architecture of the UK National Data Library (NDL) with a strong focus on building it as an AI-ready data infrastructure through standardised vocabularies, automated analysis tools, and interoperability services. We follow the ODI Multilayer Interoperability Framework (MIF) for data stewardship, covering central socio-technical aspects for the NDL including user-centric approaches to service design and governance.</description>

      <title>Cultural Differences and Perverse Incentives in Science Create a Bad Mix: Exploring Country-Level Publication Bias in Select ACM Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of big science, many national governments are helping to build well-funded teams of scientists to serve nationalistic ambitions, providing financial incentives for certain outcomes for purposes other than advancing science. This in turn can impact the behavior of scientists and create distorted country-level bias in publication rates, frequency, and publication venues targeted. To that end, we have found evidence that indicates significant inequality among the publication rates of individual scientists from various countries, based on an intensive analysis of papers published in several well-known ACM conferences (HRI, IUI, KDD, CHI, SIGGRAPH, UIST, and UBICOMP) over 15 years between 2010 to 2024. Furthermore, scientists who were affiliated with the top-5 countries (in terms of research expenditure) were found to be contributing significantly more to the inequality in publication rates than others. Given evidence of certain countries aggressively pushing their scientists via $\textit{perverse incentives}$ to publish in well-regarded publication venues and produce significant results (by any means necessary), we detected and present several examples of potential ethical problems in publications caused by such systems. Additionally, topic modeling using LDA and semantic similarity revealed that some countries are not pursuing diverse scientific topics relative to others, indicating those incentives may be limiting genuine scientific curiosity. All in all, our findings raise awareness of systems put in place by certain national governments that not only erodes the pursuit of truth through science, but also appears to be gradually undermining the integrity of the global scientific community.</description>

      <title>Understanding the importance of SHAPE to the UK research ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework (ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability and preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and Museum Collections [1] as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital Twin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then describe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be the peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for further research in this field.</description>
