      <title>Astronomy knowledge in secondary school students in Colombia: an evaluation from the AstrodidaXis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exploratory analysis of the astronomical knowledge of 241 secondary education students in Boyac\'a, Colombia, members of the AstrodidaXis network, was carried out using a qualitative, hermeneutic and exploratory methodology. This analysis was developed through a questionnaire aligned with the learning standards of the Ministry of National Education, as a basis for identifying areas of strength and weakness in astronomy concepts. The need to improve the understanding of various topics was highlighted, including the fundamental forces of the universe and the origin of chemical elements from the teaching of astronomy. These findings contributed to the construction of projections for the research and development of astronomy teaching in Boyac\'a, promoting the scientific, technological and social progress of the region.</description>

      <title>From Research to Resources: Assessing Student Understanding and Skills in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revolutionary new field of Quantum Computing (QC) continues to gain attention in industry, academia, and government in both research and education. At educational institutions, there is a proliferation of introductory courses at various academic levels signaling a growing interest and recognition of the significance of this field. A crucial and often overlooked aspect is the development of research-based materials and pedagogical approaches to effectively teach the complexities of quantum computing to diverse cohorts of learners across multiple disciplines. There is a great need for empirical investigations of the effectiveness of learning materials and pedagogical approaches in this new interdisciplinary field. We present an empirical investigation done at an R1 institution using the multiple case study method. We compare a case study on students in an introductory QC course without research-based mini-tutorials to a study of students taking the QC course with research-based mini-tutorials. We compare the strengths and difficulties of students in the two courses, discuss the general strengths and difficulties of students across both courses, postulate the effectiveness of the mini-tutorials and discuss how they can be revised. Strengths across both classes include the ability to apply single-qubit and two-qubit gates, favoring application of Dirac notation, and a reasonable understanding of normalization, probability and teleportation described qualitatively. Difficulties across both classes included use of matrix representation, use of rotation gates, and an ability to recall and analyze quantitatively a circuit representing teleportation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Virtual and Physical Laboratories: A Web-Based Interactive Platform for Undergraduate Physics Practicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the challenges of maintaining hands-on laboratory instruction in undergraduate physics education. In response, we developed and deployed an interactive online physics laboratory platform designed to closely replicate the experimental setups available and curriculum of St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata. The platform is designed to closely replicate real experimental arrangements and is aligned with the curriculum, allowing students to prepare effectively before performing physical experiments. Student feedback revealed that 100% of the respondents rated the platform as beneficial (rating 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale) to improve conceptual understanding and increase confidence in conducting physical experiments. Furthermore, all students agreed that having access to the online prelab simulations is advantageous and recommended its regular use. These findings highlight the effectiveness of web-based simulations as a complementary and sustainable resource for physics education.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Upper-Level Undergraduate Quantum Mechanics Courses in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upper-level, undergraduate quantum mechanics (QM) is widely considered a difficult subject with many varied approaches to teaching it and considerable variation in content coverage. For example, two common approaches to undergraduate QM instruction are spins-first, which focuses on the postulates of QM in spin systems before discussing wavefunctions, and wavefunctions-first, which focuses on the Schr\"odinger equation and its solutions for continuous functions in various potentials before discussing spin. These different approaches, along with the content variability in the textbooks used by instructors, may mean students learn different things in QM classes across the United States (U.S.). In this paper, we offer a characterization of QM courses based on survey responses from instructors at institutions across the U.S. With the responses of 76 instructors teaching QM courses (or sequences), we present results detailing their teaching methodologies, use of pedagogical resources, and coverage of QM topics. We find that the plurality of instructors in our sample are using traditional lecture, but many instructors are using interactive lecture or another non-traditional method. Additionally, instructors are using a wide variety of pedagogical tools (e.g., clicker questions). Many instructors in our sample reported teaching single-semester (or single-quarter) QM courses; these instructors report similar content coverage to instructors teaching first-semester (or quarter) QM courses, though their responses showed greater variability. We additionally report a comparison of content coverage between instructors using wavefunctions-first versus spins-first approaches, finding a large degree of overlap with differences in coverage for a few specific topics. These findings can help inform both future research and instructional efforts in QM education.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Planar Charged Particle Trap for Experiential Learning in Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an inexpensive and accessible instructional setup that explores particle trapping with a planar linear ion trap. The planar trap is constructed using standard printed circuit board manufacturing and is designed to trap macroscopic charged particles in air. Trapping, shuttling, and splitting are demonstrated to students using these particles, which are visible to the naked eye. Students control trap voltages and can compare properties of particle motion with an analytic model of the trap using a computer vision program for particle tracking. Learning outcomes include understanding the design considerations for planar AC traps, mechanisms underpinning particle ejection, the physics of micromotion, and methods of data analysis using standard computer vision libraries.</description>
