      <title>Transmission Coefficient of Super-Janus Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the transmission coefficient of the super-Janus interface conformal field theory, both at weak and at strong coupling, where latter is described holographically as a domain-wall solution on AdS$_2\times S^2\times M_4\times\Sigma$. Surprisingly we find perfect agreement between the free and strong coupling answer, mirroring a similar unexpected equivalence previously found for the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Monopole Breaking of Chern-Weil Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories in $d$ dimensions with a nontrivial fundamental group admit a $(d-3)$-form magnetic symmetry and a $(d-5)$-form instantonic symmetry. These are examples of Chern-Weil symmetries, with conserved currents built out of the gauge field strength, which can only be explicitly broken through violations of the Bianchi identity. For U(1) gauge theory, it is clear that magnetic monopoles violate not only the $(d-3)$-form magnetic symmetry but also lower-form symmetries like the instantonic symmetry. It is also known that an improved instanton number symmetry current, which is conserved, can be constructed in the case that the magnetic monopole admits a dyonic excitation. We study the generalization to other gauge groups, showing that magnetic monopoles also violate instantonic symmetries for nonabelian groups like PSU($n$), and that dyon modes can restore such symmetries. Furthermore, we show that in many (but not all) examples where a gauge group $G$ is Higgsed to a gauge group $H$, the structure of monopoles and dyons emerging from the Higgsing process explicitly breaks the instantonic symmetries of $H$ to those of $G$. The meaning of explicit breaking of a $(d-5)$-form symmetry is clearest for $d &gt; 4$, but these results also extend to $d = 4$, where the breaking is interpreted as an obstruction to coupling the theory to a background axion field.</description>

      <title>An Operator Algebraic Approach To Black Hole Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operator algebraic perspective on the black hole information problem. For a black hole after Page time that is entangled with the early radiation we formulate a version of the information puzzle that is well-posed in the $G\to 0$ limit. We then give a description of the information recovery protocol in terms of von Neumann algebras using elements of the Jones index theory of type II$_1$ subfactors. The subsequent evaporation and recovery steps are represented by Jones's basic construction, and an operation called the canonical shift. A central element in our description is the Jones projection, which leads to an entanglement swap and implements an operator algebraic version of a quantum teleportation protocol. These aspects are further elaborated on in a microscopic model based on type I algebras. Finally, we argue that in the emergent type III algebra the canonical shift may be interpreted as a spacetime translation and, hence, that at the microscopic level "translation = teleportation".</description>

      <title>Loops, Recursions, and Soft Limits for Fermionic Correlators in (A)dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of correlation functions in AdS/CFT and in-in correlators in de Sitter space often requires the computation of Witten diagrams. Due to the complexity of evaluating radial integrals for these correlators, several indirect approaches have been developed to simplify computations. However, in momentum space, these methods have been limited to fields with integer spin. In this paper, we formulate tools for evaluating Witten diagrams with spin$-\frac12$ fields in momentum space and discuss where they differ from the corresponding integer-spin analysis. We formulate our tools explicitly for massless fermions and present how appropriate Weight shifting operators with respect to the external kinematics can be used to obtain the generalization to fermions with integer mass. We apply these tools to loop Witten diagrams and also discuss their use for evaluating in-in correlators in dS. In cases where we can evaluate the loop integrals, we find their transcendentality is lower than the corresponding scalar field results. Further, we classify the nature of IR divergences encountered for interacting massive scalars and fermions. We also prove a novel Weinberg-like soft theorem for gauge fields coupled to matter in AdS and show that the universal terms in the leading soft factor are sensitive to the spin of the matter field. These generalize the recently discovered soft theorems for pure Yang-Mills to Yang-Mills with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on lectures I gave at TASI 2024 on Physics for Machine Learning. The focus is on neural network theory, organized according to network expressivity, statistics, and dynamics. I present classic results such as the universal approximation theorem and neural network / Gaussian process correspondence, and also more recent results such as the neural tangent kernel, feature learning with the maximal update parameterization, and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The exposition on neural network theory emphasizes a field theoretic perspective familiar to theoretical physicists. I elaborate on connections between the two, including a neural network approach to field theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Noetherian Conformal Cheshire Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational Cheshire effect refers to the possibility of turning off the gravitational field while still leaving an imprint of the nonminimal coupling of matter to gravity. This allows nontrivial solutions in flat spacetime for which no backreaction is possible. The effect was originally shown to manifest itself for standard nonminimal couplings, such as those allowing conventional conformally invariant scalar fields. Recently, the most general scalar field action yielding a conformally invariant second-order equation was constructed, and entails a more involved nonminimal coupling explicitly breaking the conformal invariance of the action without spoiling it in the equation. We have succeeded in fully describing the spherically symmetric stealth solutions on flat spacetime supporting the Cheshire effect within this general non-Noetherian conformal theory. The allowed configurations are divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an extension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal theory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal contribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is expressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have found the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and well-established mathematical tools.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Stability, Rigidity and Unitarity in String Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Thesis we investigate properties of stability, rigidity and unitarity of the string landscape in ten and lower dimensions. The dissertation explores these aspects by intertwining a detailed analysis of string vacua, with and without supersymmetry, with a bottom-up study driven by unitarity. In particular, in Chapter 1 the possibility of formulating a necessary and sufficient condition for the classical stability of non-supersymmetric string vacua is discussed, emphasising the examples in ten and nine dimensions. In Chapter 2, new solutions are presented in six dimensions both for BSB and supersymmetric $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_6$ orientifold vacua, arising from a non-trivial cancellation of the R-R tadpoles. The consitency of these theories is shown by checking the cancellation of local anomalies and verifying the unitarity constraints arising from the introduction of string defects. Finally, Chapter 3 discusses the role played by a new kind of global anomaly, arising from the inconsistency of effective field theories under topology change. A systematic analysis of six-dimensional supergravity theories with $\text{SU}(2)$ gauge group and one tensor multiplet and $\text{U}(1)$ gauge group with no tensor multiplets is discussed. Novel constraints are found and their cancellation in string vacua is verified. In addition, we have investigated the $\text{SO}(16)\times \text{SO}(16)$ heterotic theory compactified on the $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_6$ orbifold and the Gepner orientifold with no tensor multiples, showing how such anomalies are cancelled. Even though expected, this result provides a non-trivial consistency check that is not guaranteed by any theorem known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Half-sided translations broken to pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We dissect the half-sided translations for 1+1 D massless scalar in Minkowski spacetime, generated by $\mathcal{G}$, into non-commutative operations built using the entanglement Hamiltonians of the underlying algebras. Explicitly, we define $G, G'$ such that $\mathcal{G} = G + G'$ with $[G, G']\neq 0$. This non-commutativity prevents a clean split of $\exp(is \mathcal{G})$, and requires the Zassenhaus product formula. We compute all the infinite terms in the product explicitly, and show $\exp(is \mathcal{G}) = \exp( i s G ) \exp( i s G' ) \exp( f(s) [G, G'] )$ for a real function $f(s)$. We study the consequences of this result through flow of local operators under $G$ and $G'$, and show that while in regions where $G'$ has no causal influence, the action of $G$ is indistinguishable from that of $\mathcal{G}$; in the region where both $G$ and $G'$ together create $\mathcal{G}$, the action of $G$ is remarkably different. We conclude by discussing how our results can be applied to the island paradigm.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress on the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics for black holes in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, we investiggate the hologrphic thermodynamics for the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Through the extended bulk thermodynamics for the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole, we derive the first law of the CFT thermodynamics which is obtained by directly translating the arbitrary conformal factors in the dual CFT. In addition to the newly defined chemical potential $\mu$ conjugating to the central charge $C$, we obtain other pairs of thermodynamics for the CFT, such as the temperature $\tilde{T}$ and the entropy $S$, the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\tilde{\alpha}$ and its conjugate variable $ \tilde{\mathcal{A}}$, the pressure $\mathcal{P}$ and its conjugate volume $\mathcal{V}$. In the fixed $C$, $\mathcal{V}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ canonical ensemble, we obtain the canonical description of the CFT thermodynamics and observe the standard swallowtail behavior in the Helmholtz free energy vs the temperature plot. The self-intersection point of the Helmholtz free energy indicates the phase transition between the high and low entropy states of the CFT. By using Maxwell's equal area law, we get the critical point and coexistence curve for the high and low entropy phases of the CFT. Besides, we get the critical exponents for the CFT, and find that the critical point and critical exponents associated with the $\tilde{T}-S$ criticality of the CFT are the same as those of the five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Rotational influence on fermions within negative curvature wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we examine relativistic fermions within the rotating frame of negative curvature wormholes. Initially, as is typical in our context, we introduce the wormholes by embedding a curved surface into a higher dimensional flat Minkowski spacetime. Subsequently, we derive the spacetime metric that characterizes the rotating frame of these wormholes. We then investigate analytical solutions of the generalized Dirac equation within this framework. Through exploring a second-order nonperturbative wave equation, we seek exact solutions for fermions within the rotating frame of hyperbolic and elliptic wormholes, also known as negative curvature wormholes. Our analysis provides closed-form energy expressions, and we generalize our findings to Weyl fermions. By considering the impact of the rotating frame and curvature radius of wormholes, we discuss how these factors affect the evolution of fermionic fields, offering valuable insights into their behavior.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential in Finite Formulation of QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent works, we have shown how $n$-point correlation functions in perturbative QFT can be computed without running into intermediate divergences. Here we want to illustrate explicitly that one can calculate the quantum effective potential by the same method. As a main example, we consider a theory with two fields having large and small vacuum expectation values (vev). We show that no fine-tuning between the {\it physical quantities} is needed to keep the hierarchy between the vevs of different fields.</description>

      <title>New Janus interfaces from four-dimensional N=3 gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new supersymmetric Janus solutions from four-dimensional $N=3$ gauged supergravity coupled to eight vector multiplets with $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=3$ $AdS_4$ vacuum with the full $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ symmetry unbroken and a family of supersymmetric $N=1,2,3$ and non-supersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacua with different residual symmetries. These are expected to be dual to supersymmetric Chern-Simons-Matter (CSM) theories in three dimensions via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By considering a truncation to three complex scalar fields, we find a number of Janus solutions preserving $N=1$ supersymmetry that describes conformal interfaces within $N=3$ CSM theories with $SO(3)\times SU(3)$ and $SU(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\times U(1)$ symmetries.</description>

      <title>The impact of the phase transition on Quark-Gluon Plasma with an extremely strong magnetic field in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transition within an extremely strong magnetic background field, employing a holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model with a focus on entropy and pressure properties. At relatively modest magnetic field strengths, our study discerns a crossover transition between the normal phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase as the temperature rises. In contrast, under the influence of an extremely strong magnetic field, a first-order phase transition is observed. A critical point is identified at $ (eB_c, T_c) \approx (2.8623 \, \text{GeV}^2, 0.1191 \, \text{GeV}) $, which corresponds to a second-order phase transition. This phase structure is found to be in qualitative agreement with lattice simulation predictions reported in [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{105}, 034511 (2022)]. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the magnetic field on the jet quenching parameter across various phases. At zero magnetic field ($ eB = 0$ ), the normalized jet quenching parameter $ \hat{q} / T^3 $ exhibits a monotonic increase with temperature. However, in the presence of a magnetic background field, the normalized jet quenching parameters not only display directional anisotropy but also experience a universal enhancement, particularly in the vicinity of the critical temperature region. This observation suggests that the jet quenching parameter could potentially act as an indicator of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping bulk locality. Part II: Interacting functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locality of bulk operators in AdS imposes stringent constraints on their description in terms of the boundary CFT. These constraints are encoded as sum rules on the bulk-to-boundary expansion coefficients. In this paper, we construct families of sum rules that are (i) complete and (ii) `dual' to sparse CFT spectra. The sum rules trivialise the reconstruction of bulk operators in strongly interacting QFTs in AdS space and allow us to write down explicit, exact, interacting solutions to the locality problem. Technically, we characterise `completeness' of a set of sum rules by constructing Schauder bases for a certain space of real-analytic functions. In turn, this allows us to prove a Paley-Weiner type theorem characterising the space of sum rules. Remarkably, with control over this space, it is possible to write down closed-form `designer sum rules', dual to a chosen spectrum of CFT operators meeting certain criteria. We discuss the consequences of our results for both analytic and numerical bootstrap applications.</description>

      <title>Spinning waveforms in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytic all-order-in-spin expressions for the leading-order time-domain waveforms generated in the scattering of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary masses and spin vectors in the presence of all independent cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. These are the two parity-even interactions $I_1$ and $G_3$, and the parity-odd ones $\tilde{I}_1$ and $\tilde{G}_3$. Our results are obtained using three independent methods: a particularly efficient direct integration and tensor reduction approach; integration by parts combined with the method of differential equations; and finally a residue computation. For the case of the $G_3$ and $\tilde{G}_3$ deformations we can express the spinning waveform in terms of the scalar waveform with appropriately shifted impact parameters, which are reminiscent of Newman-Janis shifts. For $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ similar shifts occur, but are accompanied by additional contributions that cannot be captured by simply shifting the scalar $I_1$ and $\tilde{I}_1$ waveforms. We also show the absence of leading-order corrections to gravitational memory. Our analytic results are notably compact, and we compare the effectiveness of the three methods used to obtain them. We also briefly comment on the magnitude of the corrections to observables due to cubic deformations.</description>

      <title>Mapping from Exact RG to Holographic RG in Flat Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier papers a method was given for constructing from first principles a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean AdS space for a Euclidean CFT on the boundary. The starting point was an Exact RG for the boundary theory. The bulk action is obtained from the evolution operator for this ERG followed by a field redefinition. This procedure guarantees that the boundary correlators are all recovered correctly. In this paper we use the same method in an attempt to construct a holographic dual action for the free $O(N)$ model where the bulk is flat Euclidean space with a plane boundary wall. The scalar cubic interaction is found to be local (in $D=3$) but depends on the distance from the boundary - which can be interpreted as a non constant background dilaton field. The spin 2 - scalar - scalar interaction is found to be non local - in contrast to the AdS case. A field redefinition that makes the kinetic term quartic in derivatives can be done to mitigate (but not eliminate) this non locality. It is shown that, in spite of the non locality, the action can be obtained by gauge fixing an action that has the linearized gauge invariance associated with general coordinate invariance. Boundary correlators (two point and three point) are shown to be reproduced by bulk calculations - as expected in this approach to holography.</description>

      <title>Bulk-induced D-brane deformations and the string coupling constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider computing the on-shell disk action of open-closed string field theory as a gauge-invariant way of capturing the shift in D-brane tension that is induced by a deformation of the bulk CFT. We study the effect of bulk matter deformations (both marginal and relevant) on a wide range of boundary conditions in a number of CFTs up to subleading (two-loop) order in perturbation theory. In all analyzed examples, we find that the shift in the $g$-function of the matter boundary state is always accompanied by a boundary-independent shift in the string coupling constant, whose leading behaviour is universally proportional to the sphere two-point function of the deforming bulk operator.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supercurrents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have constructed conserved $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supercurrents for an arbitrary integer spin through the unconstrained superfield formulation of $4D,\, \mathcal{N}=2$ massless higher-spin theories in the harmonic superspace. The obtained supercurrents are gauge-invariant and determine consistent cubic interactions in the \textit{gauge superfield} $\times$ \textit{supercurrent} form for massless spin $\mathbf{s_1}$ and two massless spin $\mathbf{s_2}$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplets. Such interactions and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents exist only for $\mathbf{s_1}\geq 2 \mathbf{s_2}$. These supercurrents are the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric extension of Berends-Burgers-van Dam higher-spin currents and generalize the linearized Bel-Robinson tensor. The relevant $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents can be considered as the descendants of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ primary supercurrent, which has a simple universal structure. An important feature of our outcomes is that, ultimately, all $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents are built from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths, which are constructed from the unconstrained analytical higher-spin prepotentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that holomorphic twists of supersymmetric field theories naturally come with a symmetry $L_\infty$-algebra that nontrivially extends holomorphic symmetry. This symmetry acts on spacetime fields only up to homotopy, and the extension is only visible at the level of higher components of the action. We explicitly compute this for the holomorphic twist of ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, which produces a nontrivial action of a higher $L_\infty$-algebra on (a graded version) of five-dimensional affine space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free energy, or equivalently the ground state energy in finite volume, may be calculated from forward scattering amplitudes using a formula due to Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein. However a naive treatment leads to singularities when considering the scattering of three or more particles. It is shown in detail how the approach can be applied to multi-particle scattering in various massive scalar theories in 1+1d, with or without integrability. The results for the sinh-Gordon, Lieb-Liniger, and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models are compared to exact results. It is shown how bound states can be considered in this approach by considering the attractive Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of Electroweak Scale via Higgs-portal: Dyson-Schwinger in Conformally Invariant Scalar Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate conformally extended Standard Model with a hidden scalar $\phi$. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the hidden sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of Higgs-portal mixed quartic coupling $\beta$ and self interaction quartic coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated . Finally, we discuss how this idea of non-perturbative EW scale generation can serve as a new starting point for better realistic model building in the context of resolving the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is possible to make a detector which clicks after absorbing a single graviton. Similarly, it is possible to make a gravitational wave detector which can see the quantum noise induced by certain highly squeezed states of the graviton. However, contrary to some recent arguments in the literature, observation of either or both of these signals would not constitute proof or even evidence that the gravitational field is quantized. This is a simple technical statement: a classical gravitational wave can produce the same output data in a detector. Here we explain this result, presented earlier in arXiv:2308.12988, which is a straightforward extension of an ancient argument in quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass ``stars'' and showing they are dynamically unstable. \emph{A fortiori}, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star whose pressure is not a monotonically increasing function of the energy density must be dynamically unstable. Furthermore, we argue that all acceptable barotropic models of negative-mass stars must be in this class, and are thus unstable.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews the work done on black hole interior volume, entropy, and evaporation. An insight into the basics for understanding the interior volume is presented. A general analogy to investigate the interior volume of a black hole, the associated quantum mode's entropy, and the evolution relation between the interior and exterior entropy is explained. Using this analogy, we predicted the future of information stored in a BH, its radiation, and evaporation. The results are noted in tables (\ref{tab:1}) and (\ref{tab:2}). To apply this analogy in BH space-time, we investigated the interior volume, entropy, and evaluation relation for different types of BHs. Finally, we also investigated the nature of BH radiation and the probability of particle emission during the evaporation process.</description>

Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

Abstract: The next-to-leading order weak-coupling shear viscosity of QCD was computed 6 years ago.
  However, these results have never been applied at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu$, even though intermediate-energy heavy ion collisions and merging neutron stars may explore the Quark-Gluon Plasma in a regime where baryon chemical potentials are large.
  Here, we extend the next-to-leading order shear viscosity calculations to finite $\mu$, and we show that, while the convergence of the weak-coupling expansion is questionable for achievable plasmas, it is somewhat better at $\mu &gt; T$ than at $\mu=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perfect transfer of information in 1+1D continuous quantum systems. This includes effective descriptions of inhomogeneous spin chains, for which the notion of perfect state transfer in quantum information was introduced, and here phrased in terms of waves. We show that reflection symmetry is necessary for perfect wave transfer (PWT) in any inhomogeneous conformal field theory, and even sufficient when restricted to one-particle excitations. To determine if or when it is sufficient more generally, we first break conformal invariance and study a broad class of 1+1D bosonic theories. We show that the question can then be posed as an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem that determines when the bosonic theory exhibits PWT. We demonstrate how to uniquely solve this problem, which also shows that reflection symmetry is sufficient for the special case with conformal invariance. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend these notions to interacting quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: We show that, given a two-dimensional realization of the celestial OPE in self-dual Yang-Mills, we can find a scalar source around which scattering amplitudes replicate correlation functions computed from the 2D `gluon' operators in a limit where a dynamic massless scalar decouples. We derive conditions on the two-dimensional three-point correlation function so that such a source exists and give two particular examples of this construction, one in which gluons are constructed from vertex operators in the semiclassical limit of Liouville theory and another in which the soft gluons arise from generalized free fields. Finally, we identify a bulk dual to the level of the boundary Kac-Moody algebra and discuss moving beyond the decoupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of symmetries leads to universal phenomena. We extend this notion to $(-1)$-form U(1) symmetries. The spontaneous breaking is diagnosed by a dependence of the vacuum energy on a constant background field $\theta$, which can be probed by the topological susceptibility. This leads to a reinterpretation of the Strong CP problem as arising from a spontaneously broken instantonic symmetry in QCD. We discuss how known solutions to the problem are unified in this framework and explore some, so far unsuccessful, attempts to find new solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Spinning binary dynamics in cubic effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the binary dynamics of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary spin vectors in the presence of parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of gravity. We first derive the tree-level Compton amplitudes for a Kerr black hole in cubic gravity, which we then use to compute the two-to-two amplitudes of the massive bodies to leading order in the deformation and the post-Minkowskian expansion. The required one-loop computations are performed using the leading singularity approach as well as the heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT) approach. These amplitudes are then used to compute the leading-order momentum and spin kick in cubic gravity in the KMOC formalism. Our results are valid for generic masses and spin vectors, and include all the independent parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We also present spin-expanded expressions for the momentum and spin kicks, and the all-order in spin deflection angle in the case of aligned spins.</description>

      <title>The quasilocal energy and thermodynamic first law in accelerating AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We scrutinize the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the off-shell quasilocal formalism, which amalgamates the ADT formalism with the covariant phase space approach. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the energy expression is articulated through the surface term derived from our formalism. The essence of our analysis of the quasilocal energy resides in the surface contributions coming from the conical singularities as well as the conventional radial boundary. Consequently, the resultant conserved quasilocal energy naturally conforms the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without necessitating any augmentation of thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions in $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed Theories on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of local operators in unitary $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a torus, using their formulation in terms of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We focus on the two-point correlation function in momentum space when the undeformed theory is a conformal field theory. The large momentum behavior of the correlation function is computed and compared to that of $\textrm{T}\bar{\textrm{T}}$-deformed field theories defined on a plane. For the latter, the behavior found was $|q|^{-\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $q$ is the momentum and $t$ is the deformation parameter. For a torus, the same behavior is found for $|q|&lt;&lt;L/t$, where $L$ is the torus' length scale. However, for $|q|&gt;&gt;L/t$, a different behavior is found: $\left(\frac{4\sqrt{t}^5q^2}{\pi e L^3|T|^2}\right)^{\frac{tq^2}{\pi}}$, where $T$ is the modular parameter of the torus. Hence, at large momentum, the correlator decays and then grows. This behavior suggests that operators carrying momentum $q$ are smeared on a distance scale $t|q|$. The difference from the plane's result illustrates the non-locality of the theory and the UV-IR mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a higher categorial interpretation of entanglement involving gauge theories and $\sigma$-models instead of qubits, one recovers T-duality as a form of ancilla aided entanglement generation. This opens the way towards new dualities in gauge theories and $\sigma$-models produced by means of analogies with quantum circuits of various types.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole versus inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the dark matter(DM) production processes and its parameters space in the background of reheating obtained from two chief systems in the early Universe: the inflaton $\phi$ and the primordial black holes (PBHs). We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself. Inflaton-dominated reheating is observed to further widen such possibilities depending on the initial population of black holes and its mass as well as the coupling of the inflaton to the standard model sector.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortex lattice: Lifshitz duality, topological defects and multipole symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an effective field theory of a vortex lattice in a two-dimensional neutral rotating superfluid. Utilizing particle-vortex dualities, we explore its formulation in terms of a $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to elasticity, that at low energies reduces to a compact Lifshitz theory augmented with a Berry phase term encoding the vortex dynamics in the presence of a superflow. Utilizing elasticity- and Lifshitz-gauge theory dualities, we derive dual formulations of the vortex lattice in terms of a traceless symmetric scalar-charge theory and demonstrate low-energy equivalence of our dual gauge theory to its elasticity-gauge theory dual. We further discuss a multipole symmetry of the vortex lattice and its dual gauge theory's multipole one-form symmetries. We also study its topological crystalline defects, where the multipole one-form symmetry plays a prominent role. It classifies the defects, explains their restricted mobility, and characterizes descendant vortex phases, which includes a novel vortex supersolid phase. Using the dual gauge theory, we also develop a mean-field theory for the quantum melting transition from a vortex crystal to a vortex supersolid.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularities in $f(T,\phi)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of understanding the mysteries surrounding dark energy has sparked significant interest within the field of cosmology. While conventional approaches, such as the cosmological constant, have been extensively explored, alternative theories incorporating scalar field-based models and modified gravity have emerged as intriguing avenues. Among these, teleparallel theories of gravity, specifically the $f(T,\phi)$ formulation, have gained prominence as a means to comprehend dark energy within the framework of teleparallelism. In this study, we investigate two well-studied models of teleparallel dark energy and examine the presence of cosmological singularities within these scenarios. Using the Goriely-Hyde procedure, we examine the dynamical systems governing the cosmological equations of these models. Our analysis reveals that both models exhibit Type IV singularities, but only for a limited range of initial conditions. These results could indicate a potential edge for teleparallel cosmological models over their other modified gravity counterparts, as the models we examine seem to be only allowing for weak singularities that too under non general conditions.</description>

      <title>3D Tensor Renormalisation Group at High Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$ tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.</description>

      <title>Improved model of large-field inflation with primordial black hole production in Starobinsky-like supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the "no-scale-type" K\"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type ("renormalizable") superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis, primordial gravitational waves, and PBH-induced reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Form Invariance of Raychaudhuri equation in the presence of Inflaton-type fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Raychaudhuri equation remains form invariant for certain solutions of scalar fields $\phi$ whose Lagrangian is non-canonical and of the form $\mathcal{L}(X,\phi)=-V(\phi)F(X)$, with $X=\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \nabla^{\mu}\phi \nabla^{\nu} \phi$ and $V(\phi)$ the potential. Solutions exist for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields that are like inflatons. Certain recent observations indicate that the cosmos is inhomogeneous and thus our results are in sync with the latest observations. So the Raychaudhuri equation can accommodate primordial inhomogeneities as well as cosmologically relevant scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the intricate relationship between the q-boson model, a quantum integrable system, and classical integrable systems such as the Toda and KP hierarchies. Initially, we analyze scalar products of off-shell Bethe states and explore their connections to tau functions of integrable hierarchies.

      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Standard Model anomalies and vacuum stability for lepton portals with extra $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>
