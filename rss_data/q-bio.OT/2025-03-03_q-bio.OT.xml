      <title>Accurate 3D Grapevine Structure Extraction from High-Resolution Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D modelling of grapevines is crucial for precision viticulture, particularly for informed pruning decisions and automated management techniques. However, the intricate structure of grapevines poses significant challenges for traditional skeletonization algorithms. This paper presents an adaptation of the Smart-Tree algorithm for 3D grapevine modelling, addressing the unique characteristics of grapevine structures. We introduce a graph-based method for disambiguating skeletonization. Our method delineates individual cane skeletons, which are crucial for precise analysis and management. We validate our approach using annotated real-world grapevine point clouds, demonstrating improvement of 15.8% in the F1 score compared to the original Smart-Tree algorithm. This research contributes to advancing 3D grapevine modelling techniques, potentially enhancing both the sustainability and profitability of grape production through more precise and automated viticulture practices</description>

      <title>Evidence for strong modality-dependence of chronotype assessment from real world calendar app data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronotypes allow for comparisons of one individual's daily rhythms to that of others and the environment. Mismatch between an individual's chronotype and the timing constraints of their social environment create social jet lag, which is correlated with mental and physical health risks. The concept of chronotype implicitly supposes that a single phase applies to an individual, whereas the circadian rhythms of different internal systems entrain to or have their outputs masked by different environmental inputs. If the modern environment interferes with internal synchrony or generates different masking for different internal system's outputs, then real world data reflecting these outputs ought to reveal relatively low correlations, reflecting environmental interference. At the other extreme, if there is no behavior or tissue specific interference, then different internal system outputs should all be equally predicted from data modalities capturing their different outputs. Here we explore multimodal behavioral rhythm data from the Owaves calendaring app, focusing on behavioral outputs logged as: Sleep, Exercise, Eat, Work, Love, Play, Relax, Misc. We find that individuals show daily rhythms within each behavior type from which chronotypes can be assigned, but that chronotypes derived from different behaviors (or combinations of behaviors) lead to nearly independent sorting of individual's by phase. This suggests that if real world data are used to assign an individuals chronotype, then that chronotype may be specific to the internal system the output of which is related to each specific data modality assessed. Our findings suggest that researchers cannot confidently assume to account for outputs from other internal systems in real world settings without additional observations or controls.</description>
