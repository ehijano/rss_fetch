      <title>Information Revelation and Pandering in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do elections efficiently aggregate politicians' policy-relevant private information? This paper argues that politicians' office motivation is an obstacle. In a two-candidate Hotelling-Downs model in which each candidate has socially-valuable policy information, we establish that equilibrium welfare is at best what can be obtained by disregarding one politician's information. We also find that for canonical information structures, politicians have an incentive to ``anti-pander'', i.e., to overreact to their information. Some degree of pandering -- underreacting to information -- would be socially beneficial.</description>

      <title>Generalized Social Marginal Welfare Weights Imply Inconsistent Comparisons of Tax Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns Saez and Stantcheva's (2016) generalized social marginal welfare weights, which aggregate losses and gains due to tax policies, while incorporating non-utilitarian ethical considerations. The approach evaluates local tax changes without a global social objective. I show that local tax policy comparisons implicitly entail global comparisons. Moreover, whenever welfare weights do not have a utilitarian structure, these implied global comparisons are inconsistent. I argue that broader ethical values cannot in general be represented simply by modifying the weights placed on benefits to different people, and a more thoroughgoing modification of the utilitarian approach is required.</description>

      <title>Empirical Welfare Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Welfare economics relies on access to agents' utility functions: we revisit classical questions in welfare economics, assuming access to data on agents' past choices instead of their utilities. Our main result considers the existence of utilities that render a given allocation Pareto optimal. We show that a candidate allocation is efficient for some utilities consistent with the choice data if and only if it is efficient for an incomplete relation derived from the revealed preference relations and convexity. Similar ideas are used to make counterfactual choices for a single consumer, policy comparisons by the Kaldor criterion, and offer bounds on the degree of inefficiency in a Pareto suboptimal allocation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Verification of Rumors in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a true and a false message when agents are biased and able to verify messages. As a recipient of a rumor who verifies it becomes informed of the truth, a higher rumor prevalence can increase the prevalence of the truth. We uncover conditions such that this happens and discuss policy implications. Specifically, a planner aiming to maximize the prevalence of the truth should allow rumors to circulate if: verification overcomes ignorance of messages, transmission of information is relatively low, and the planner's budget to induce verification is neither too low nor too high.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimal Allocation with Costly Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mechanism design problem of a principal allocating a single good to one of several agents without monetary transfers. Each agent desires the good and uses it to create value for the principal. We designate this value as the agent's private type. Even though the principal does not know the agents' types, she can verify them at a cost. The allocation of the good thus depends on the agents' self-declared types and the results of any verification performed, and the principal's payoff matches her value of the allocation minus the costs of verification. It is known that if the agents' types are independent, then a favored-agent mechanism maximizes her expected payoff. However, this result relies on the unrealistic assumptions that the agents' types follow known independent probability distributions. In contrast, we assume here that the agents' types are governed by an ambiguous joint probability distribution belonging to a commonly known ambiguity set and that the principal maximizes her worst-case expected payoff. We study support-only ambiguity sets, which contain all distributions supported on a rectangle, Markov ambiguity sets, which contain all distributions in a support-only ambiguity set satisfying some first-order moment bounds, and Markov ambiguity sets with independent types, which contain all distributions in a Markov ambiguity set under which the agents' types are mutually independent. In all cases we construct explicit favored-agent mechanisms that are not only optimal but also Pareto-robustly optimal.</description>

      <title>Random partitions, potential, value, and externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shapley value equals a player's contribution to the potential of a game. The potential is a most natural one-number summary of a game, which can be computed as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition of the players. This computation integrates the coalition formation of all players and readily extends to games with externalities. We investigate those potential functions for games with externalities that can be computed this way. It turns out that the potential that corresponds to the MPW solution introduced by Macho-Stadler et al. (2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339--356) is unique in the following sense. It is obtained as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition, it generalizes the potential for games without externalities, and it induces a solution that satisfies the null player property even in the presence of externalities.</description>
