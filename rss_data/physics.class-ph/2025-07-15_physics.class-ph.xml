      <title>Static and dynamic ordering of magnetic repelling particles under confinement: disks vs bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electromagnetic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.</description>

      <title>Leakage at interfaces: a comprehensive study based on Persson contact mechanics theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of gas leakage at interfaces based on Persson contact mechanics theory. A prototype syringe system consisting of a rubber stopper and a glass barrel is selected, where surface roughness is characterized using measurements from stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy, and contact pressure distributions are obtained from Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations. Leakage prediction is performed using Multiscale Contact Mechanics (MCM) software. The predicted results show good agreement with experimental measurements under controlled dry conditions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that small variations in elastic modulus and contact pressure can significantly influence leakage, particularly near the percolation threshold. This work provides a generalized and validated framework for leakage prediction and offers practical guidance for the design of sealing systems in pharmaceutical and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Classification of curl forces for all space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a decomposition of classical potentials into a conservative (gradient) component and a non-conservative component. The latter generalizes the curl component of the force in the three-dimensional case. The force is transformed into a differential $1$-form, known as the work form. This work form is decomposed into an exact (gradient) component and an antiexact component, which in turn generalizes the curl part of the force. The antiexact component is subsequently decomposed using the Frobenius theorem. This local decomposition is a useful tool for identifying the specific components of classical potentials.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>
