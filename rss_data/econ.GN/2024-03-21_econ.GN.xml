      <title>Optimal VPPI strategy under Omega ratio with stochastic benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a variable proportion portfolio insurance (VPPI) strategy. The objective is to determine the risk multiplier by maximizing the extended Omega ratio of the investor's cushion, using a binary stochastic benchmark. When the stock index declines, investors aim to maintain the minimum guarantee. Conversely, when the stock index rises, investors seek to track some excess returns. The optimization problem involves the combination of a non-concave objective function with a stochastic benchmark, which is effectively solved based on the stochastic version of concavification technique. We derive semi-analytical solutions for the optimal risk multiplier, and the value functions are categorized into three distinct cases. Intriguingly, the classification criteria are determined by the relationship between the optimal risky multiplier in Zieling et al. (2014 and the value of 1. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the VPPI strategy when applied to real market data calibrations.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between the Fitness-Complexity and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover the connection between the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, developed in the economic complexity field, and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, widely used in diverse domains ranging from computer science and mathematics to economics. Despite minor formal differences between the two methods, both converge to the same fixed-point solution up to normalization. The discovered connection allows us to derive a rigorous interpretation of the Fitness and the Complexity metrics as the potentials of a suitable energy function. Under this interpretation, high-energy products are unfeasible for low-fitness countries, which explains why the algorithm is effective at displaying nested patterns in bipartite networks. We also show that the proposed interpretation reveals the scale invariance of the Fitness-Complexity algorithm, which has practical implications for the algorithm's implementation in different datasets. Further, analysis of empirical trade data under the new perspective reveals three categories of countries that might benefit from different development strategies.</description>

      <title>Path-dependency and leverage effect on capital return in periodic growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic growth processes are investigated. The expected value of the profit rate, on accrual basis, does not directly depend on divestments, neither on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of return rate on capital for the growth cycle. In the absence of intermediate divestments, the internal rate of return is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that the rotation cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth processes through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient may reach positive or negative values. Correspondingly, from the viewpoint of wealth accumulation, the often-suggested dependency of suitable rotation length on discount rate appears to be a modeling artifact. In other words, the net present value computation is based on maximization of consumption utility, instead of a capital growth objective; borrowing is obligatory, but the leverage effect is absent. The leverage effect on the internal rate of return and on the net present value are discussed.</description>
