      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi--Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein--Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi--Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi--Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi--Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose--type blow--ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi--Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow--up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi--Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi--Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of free boundary minimal annuli in geodesic balls of $\mathbb{S}^3_+$ and $\mathbb{H}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\Sigma$ an embedded free boundary minimal annulus in a geodesic ball in the round hemisphere $\mathbb{S}^3_+$ or in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$. Under the hypothesis of invariance due to an antipodal map on the geodesic ball and using the fact that this surface satisfies the Steklov problem with frequency, we prove that $\Sigma$ is congruent to a critical rotational annulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Bernstein problem of smooth maps $f:\mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ whose graphs form coassociative submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^7$. We establish a condition, expressed in terms of the second elementary symmetric polynomial of the map's slope, that ensures $f$ is affine. A corresponding result is also established for Cayley submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^8$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground states and the conformal class of a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed, orientable Riemannian surface $\Sigma_g$ of arbitrary genus $g\geq 1$ and Riemannian metric $h$ we study the magnetic Laplacian with magnetic potential given by a harmonic $1$-form $A$. Its lowest eigenvalue (magnetic ground state energy) is positive, unless $A$ represents an integral cohomology class. We isolate a countable set of ground state energies which we call $\textit{ground state spectrum}$ of the metric $h$. The main result of the paper is to show that the ground state spectrum determines the volume and the conformal class of the metric $h$. In particular, hyperbolic metrics are distinguished by their ground state spectrum.
  We also compute the magnetic spectrum of flat tori and introduce some magnetic spectral invariants of $(\Sigma_g,h)$ which are conformal by definition and involve the geometry of what we call the Jacobian torus of $(\Sigma_g,h)$ (in Algebraic Geometry, the Jacobian variety of a Riemann surface).</description>

      <title>Distributional sectional curvature bounds for Riemannian metrics of low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sectional curvature bounds are of central importance in the study of Riemannian mani\-folds, both in smooth differential geometry and in the generalized synthetic setting of Alexandrov spaces. Riemannian metrics along with metric spaces of bounded sectional curvature enjoy a variety of, oftentimes rigid, geometric properties. The purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss a new notion of sectional curvature bounds for manifolds equipped with continuous Riemannian metrics of Geroch--Traschen regularity, i.e., $H^1_{\mathrm{loc}} \cap C^0$, based on a distributional version of the classical formula. Our main result states that for $g \in C^1$, this new notion recovers the corresponding bound based on triangle comparison in the sense of Alexandrov. A weaker version of this statement is also proven for locally Lipschitz continuous metrics.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andersson and Chru\'sciel showed that generic asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets admit polyhomogeneous expansions, and that only a non-generic subclass of solutions of the conformal constraint equations is free of logarithmic singularities. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, within the evolutionary framework of the constraint equations, we show that the existence of a well-defined Bondi mass brings the asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets into a subclass whose Cauchy development guaranteed to admit a smooth boundary, by virtue of the results of Andersson and Chru\'sciel. Second, by generalizing a recent result of Beyer and Ritchie, we show that the existence of well-defined Bondi mass and angular momentum, together with some mild restrictions on the free data, implies that the generic solutions of the parabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraint equations are completely free of logarithmic singularities. We also provide numerical evidence to show that in the vicinity of Kerr, asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities can indeed be constructed.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stratification for the fractional Allen-Cahn equation and stationary nonlocal minimal surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of solutions to the fractional Allen-Cahn equation when $s\in (0, 1/2)$ and dimension $n\geq 2$. By applying the quantitative stratification principle developed by Naber and Valtorta, we obtain an optimal quantitative estimate on the transition set. As an application of this estimate, we improve the potential energy estimates of Cabre, Cinti, and Serra (2021), providing sharp versions for the fractional Allen-Cahn equation. Similarly, we obtain optimal perimeter estimates for stationary nonlocal minimal surfaces, extending previous results of Cinti, Serra, and Valdinoci (2019) from the stable case.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the almost Hermitian structure on $TM$ induced by a pair of a metric and an affine connection on $M$. We find the conditions under which $TM$ admits almost K\"ahler structures, K\"ahler structures and Einstein metrics, respectively.

      <title>Partially Hyperbolic Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and investigate two types, the latter with two variants, of notions of partial hyperbolicity accounting for several classes of compact complex manifolds behaving hyperbolically in certain directions, defined by a vector subbundle of the holomorphic tangent bundle, but not necessarily in the other directions. A key role is played by certain entire holomorphic maps, possibly from a higher-dimensional space, into the given manifold $X$. The dimension of the origin $\C^p$ of these maps is allowed to be arbitrary, unlike both the classical $1$-dimensional case of entire curves and the $1$-codimensional case introduced in previous work of the second-named author with S. Marouani. The higher-dimensional generality necessitates the imposition of certain growth conditions, very different from those in Nevanlinna theory and those in works by de Th\'elin, Burns and Sibony on Ahlfors currents, on the entire holomorphic maps $f:\C^p\longrightarrow X$. The way to finding these growth conditions is revealed by certain special, possibly non-K\"ahler, Hermitian metrics in the spirit of Gromov's K\"ahler hyperbolicity theory but in a higher-dimensional context. We then study several classes of examples, prove implications among our partial hyperbolicity notions, give a sufficient criterion for the existence of an Ahlfors current and a sufficient criterion for partial hyperbolicity in terms of the signs of two curvature-like objects introduced recently by the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Discrete Differential Geometry for $C^{1,1}$ Hyperbolic Surfaces of Non-Constant Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a discrete differential geometry for surfaces of non-constant negative curvature, which can be used to model various phenomena from the growth of flower petals to marine invertebrate swimming. Specifically, we derive and numerically integrate a version of the classical Lelieuvre formulas that apply to immersions of $C^{1,1}$ hyperbolic surfaces of non-constant curvature. In contrast to the constant curvature case, these formulas do not provide an explicit method for constructing an immersion but rather describe an immersion via an implicit set of equations. We propose an iterative method for resolving these equations. Because we are interested in scenarios where the curvature is a function of the intrinsic material coordinates, in particular, on the geodesic distance from an origin, we suggest a fast marching method for computing geodesic distance on manifolds. We apply our methods to generate surfaces of non-constant curvature and demonstrate how one can introduce branch points to account for the sort of multi-generational buckling and subwrinkling observed in many applications.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of the Bigolin complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold, we develop Hodge theory for the elliptic complex of differential forms defined by Bigolin in 1969 and recently referred as the Schweitzer complex. We exhibit several $L^2$ orthogonal decompositions of spaces of forms and prove a Hodge decomposition for harmonic forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Then we compute the cohomology of this Bigolin complex on the small deformations of the complex structure of the Iwasawa manifold, showing that, in this example, this Bigolin cohomology is as powerful as Aeppli and Bott-Chern cohomology, in order to distinguish complex structures. Recall that the double complex of a compact complex manifold decomposes into a direct sum of so-called squares and zigzags, and the zigzags are the only components contributing to cohomology. We prove that, on any compact complex manifold of complex dimension 3, the multiplicities of zigzags in this decomposition are completely characterised by Betti, Hodge, Aeppli numbers plus Bigolin numbers, namely the dimensions of the Bigolin cohomology. This result is sharp, meaning that if we remove Hodge or Bigolin numbers from the previous statement then it becomes false. We then apply this last result to fully describe the double complexes of the small deformations of the Iwasawa manifold. Finally, we partially extend the definition of this complex on almost complex manifolds, providing a cohomological invariant on $1$-forms which is finite dimensional when the manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser inequalities for symmetric functions without boundary conditions on hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding theorems for symmetric functions without zero boundary condition have been studied on flat Riemannian manifolds, such as the Euclidean space. However, these theorems have only been established on hyperbolic spaces for functions with zero boundary condition. In this work, we focus on sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for radial functions in hyperbolic spaces, considering both bounded and unbounded domains. One of the main features of our approach is that we do not assume boundary zero condition for symmetric functions on geodesic balls or the entire hyperbolic space. Our main results include Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, which establish weighted Sobolev embedding theorems, and Theorems 1.5 together with 1.6, which present Adams-Trudinger-Moser type of embedding theorems. In particular, a key result is Theorem 1.1 which is a highly nontrivial comparison result between norms of the higher order covariant derivatives and higher order derivatives of the radial functions. Higher order asymptotic behavior of radial functions on hyperbolic spaces are established to prove our main theorems. This approach includes novel radial lemmata and decay properties of higher order radial Sobolev functions defined in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Revisit Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds of dimension 6 with 4 fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the circle acts in a Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, then there are at least $n+1$ fixed points. The case that there are exactly $n+1$ isolated fixed points has its importance due to various reasons. Besides dimension 2 with 2 fixed points, and dimension 4 with 3 fixed points, which are known, the next interesting case is dimension 6 with 4 fixed points, for which the integral cohomology ring and the total Chern class of the manifold, and the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points are classified by Tolman. In this note, we use a new different argument to prove Tolman's results for the dimension 6 with 4 fixed points case. We observe that the integral cohomology ring of the manifold has a nice basis in terms of the moment map values of the fixed points, and the largest weight between two fixed points is nicely related to the first Chern class of the manifold. We will use these ingredients to determine the sets of weights of the circle action at the fixed points, and moreover to determine the global invariants the integral cohomology ring and total Chern class of the manifold. The idea allows a direct approach of the problem, and the argument is short and easy to follow.</description>

      <title>Shape Taylor expansion for wave scattering problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor expansion of wave fields with respect to shape parameters has a wide range of applications in wave scattering problems, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification. However, deriving the high order shape derivatives required for this expansion poses significant challenges with conventional methods. This paper addresses these difficulties by introducing elegant recurrence formulas for computing high order shape derivatives. The derivation employs tools from exterior differential forms, Lie derivatives, and material derivatives. The work establishes a unified framework for computing the high order shape perturbations in scattering problems. In particular, the recurrence formulas are applicable to both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering models under a variety of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, and transmission types.</description>

      <title>Integral Ricci Curvature for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of integral Ricci curvature $I_{\kappa_0}$ for graphs, which measures the amount of Ricci curvature below a given threshold $\kappa_0$. We focus our attention on the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature. As applications, we prove a Bonnet-Myers-type diameter estimate, a Moore-type estimate on the number of vertices of a graph in terms of the maximum degree $d_M$ and diameter $D$, and a Lichnerowicz-type estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Graph Laplacian, generalizing the results obtained by Lin, Lu, and Yau. All estimates are uniform, depending only on geometric parameters like $\kappa_0$, $I_{\kappa_0}$, $d_M$, or $D$, and do not require the graphs to be positively curved.</description>

      <title>Positive Scalar Curvature and crystallographic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine positive and negative results for the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture within the class of crystallographic groups. We give necessary conditions within the class of split extensions of free abelian by cyclic groups to satisfy the unstable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture. We also give necessary conditions within the same class of groups, producing an infinite number of counterexamples for the conjecture.</description>
