      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint. Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing, communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.</description>

      <title>Way to Build Native AI-driven 6G Air Interface: Principles, Roadmap, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design, deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally, it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G, outlining key challenges and research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Some Optimal and Near Optimal Doppler Resilient Complementary Sequence Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequences with excellent ambiguity functions are very useful in radar detection and modern mobile communications. Doppler resilient complementary sequence (DRCS) is a new type of sequence proposed recently, which can achieve lower ambiguity function sidelobes by summing the ambiguity functions of subsequences. In this paper, we introduce some new constructions of DRCS sets (DRCSSs) based on one-coincidence frequency-hopping sequence sets (OC-FHSSs), almost difference sets (ADSs), some specific sequences, etc. Critically, the proposed DRCSSs are optimal or near optimal.</description>

      <title>High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy (LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability. This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted. We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.</description>

      <title>Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</description>

      <title>Colour Codes Reach Surface Code Performance using Vibe Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum colour codes hold significant promise for quantum error correction, offering advantages such as planar connectivity and low overhead logical gates. Despite their theoretical appeal, the practical deployment of these codes faces challenges due to complex decoding requirements compared to surface codes. This paper introduces vibe decoding which, for the first time, brings colour code performance on par with the surface code under practical decoding. Our approach leverages an ensemble of belief propagation decoders - each executing a distinct serial message passing schedule - combined with localised statistics post-processing. We refer to this combined protocol as VibeLSD. The VibeLSD decoder is highly versatile: our numerical results show it outperforms all practical existing colour code decoders across various syndrome extraction schemes, noise models, and error rates. By estimating qubit footprints through quantum memory simulations, we show that colour codes can operate with overhead that is comparable to, and in some cases lower than, that of the surface code. This, combined with the fact that localised statistics decoding is a parallel algorithm, makes VibeLSD suitable for implementation on specialised hardware for real-time decoding. Our results establish the colour code as a practical architecture for near-term quantum hardware, providing improved compilation efficiency for both Clifford and non-Clifford gates without incurring additional qubit overhead relative to the surface code.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Improvements to List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes are a well-studied family of codes, known for achieving list decoding capacity. In this work, we give improved deterministic and randomized algorithms for list decoding FRS codes of rate $R$ up to radius $1-R-\varepsilon$.
  We present a deterministic decoder that runs in near-linear time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$, improving upon the best-known runtime $n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$ for decoding FRS codes. Prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose deterministic decoding could be done in time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$.
  We also present a randomized decoder that runs in fully polynomial time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$, improving the best-known runtime $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)\cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$ for decoding FRS codes. Again, prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose decoding time depended polynomially on $1/\varepsilon$.
  Our results are based on improved pruning procedures for finding the list of codewords inside a constant-dimensional affine subspace.</description>

      <title>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes and Their Layouts on Cold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is deemed to require error correction at scale to mitigate physical noise by reducing it to lower noise levels while operating on encoded logical qubits. Popular quantum error correction schemes include CSS code, of which surface codes provide regular mappings onto 2D planes suitable for contemporary quantum devices together with known transversal logical gates. Recently, qLDPC codes have been proposed as a means to provide denser encoding with the class of bivariate bicycle (BB) codes promising feasible design for devices.
  This work contributes a novel subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. This subclass employs {\em coprimes} and the product $xy$ of the two generating variables $x$ and $y$ to construct polynomials, rather than using $x$ and $y$ separately as in vanilla BB codes. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime-BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown. We also propose a layout on cold atom arrays tailored for coprime-BB codes. The proposed layout reduces both move time for short to medium-length codes and the number of moves of atoms to perform syndrome extractions. We consider an error model with global laser noise on cold atoms, and simulations show that our proposed layout achieves significant improvements over prior work across the simulated codes.</description>

      <title>InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.</description>

Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>

      <title>Let's Measure Information Step-by-Step: LLM-Based Evaluation Beyond Vibes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study evaluation of AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a link between strategic gaming and information loss. We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.</description>
