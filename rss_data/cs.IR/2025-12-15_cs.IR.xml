      <title>Emotion-Driven Personalized Recommendation for AI-Generated Content Using Multi-Modal Sentiment and Intent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of AI-generated content (AIGC) across domains such as music, video, and literature, the demand for emotionally aware recommendation systems has become increasingly important. Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on user behavioral data such as clicks, views, or ratings, while neglecting users' real-time emotional and intentional states during content interaction. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences.</description>

      <title>FAIR: Focused Attention Is All You Need for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, transformer-based generative recommendation has garnered significant attention for user behavior modeling. However, it often requires discretizing items into multi-code representations (e.g., typically four code tokens or more), which sharply increases the length of the original item sequence. This expansion poses challenges to transformer-based models for modeling user behavior sequences with inherent noises, since they tend to overallocate attention to irrelevant or noisy context. To mitigate this issue, we propose FAIR, the first generative recommendation framework with focused attention, which enhances attention scores to relevant context while suppressing those to irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose (1) a focused attention mechanism integrated into the standard Transformer, which learns two separate sets of Q and K attention weights and computes their difference as the final attention scores to eliminate attention noise while focusing on relevant contexts; (2) a noise-robustness objective, which encourages the model to maintain stable attention patterns under stochastic perturbations, preventing undesirable shifts toward irrelevant context due to noise; and (3) a mutual information maximization objective, which guides the model to identify contexts that are most informative for next-item prediction. We validate the effectiveness of FAIR on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>General-purpose AI models can generate actionable knowledge on agroecological crop protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.</description>

      <title>VLM2GeoVec: Toward Universal Multimodal Embeddings for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite imagery differs fundamentally from natural images: its aerial viewpoint, very high resolution, diverse scale variations, and abundance of small objects demand both region-level spatial reasoning and holistic scene understanding. Current remote-sensing approaches remain fragmented between dual-encoder retrieval models, which excel at large-scale cross-modal search but cannot interleave modalities, and generative assistants, which support region-level interpretation but lack scalable retrieval capabilities. We propose $\textbf{VLM2GeoVec}$, an instruction-following, single-encoder vision-language model trained contrastively to embed interleaved inputs (images, text, bounding boxes, and geographic coordinates) in a unified vector space. Our single encoder interleaves all inputs into one joint embedding trained with a contrastive loss, eliminating multi-stage pipelines and task-specific modules. To evaluate its versatility, we introduce $\textbf{RSMEB}$, a novel benchmark covering key remote-sensing embedding applications: scene classification; cross-modal search; compositional retrieval; visual-question answering; visual grounding and region-level reasoning; and semantic geospatial retrieval. On RSMEB, it achieves $\textbf{26.6%}$ P@1 on region-caption retrieval (+25 pp vs. dual-encoder baselines), $\textbf{32.5%}$ P@1 on referring-expression retrieval (+19 pp), and $\textbf{17.8%}$ P@1 on semantic geo-localization retrieval (over $3\times$ prior best), while matching or exceeding specialized baselines on conventional tasks such as scene classification and cross-modal retrieval. VLM2GeoVec unifies scalable retrieval with region-level spatial reasoning, enabling cohesive multimodal analysis in remote sensing. We will publicly release the code, checkpoints, and data upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Automating Historical Insight Extraction from Large-Scale Newspaper Archives via Neural Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.</description>

      <title>From Factoid Questions to Data Product Requests: Benchmarking Data Product Discovery over Tables and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data products are reusable, self-contained assets designed for specific business use cases. Automating their discovery and generation is of great industry interest, as it enables discovery in large data lakes and supports analytical Data Product Requests (DPRs). Currently, there is no benchmark established specifically for data product discovery. Existing datasets focus on answering single factoid questions over individual tables rather than collecting multiple data assets for broader, coherent products. To address this gap, we introduce Data Product Benchmark, the first user-request-driven data product benchmark over hybrid table-text corpora.
  Our framework systematically repurposes existing table-text QA datasets by clustering related tables and passages into coherent data products, generating professional-level analytical requests that span both data sources, and validating benchmark quality through multi-LLM evaluation. Data Product Benchmark preserves full provenance while producing actionable, analyst-like data product requests. Baseline experiments with hybrid retrieval methods establish the feasibility of DPR evaluation, reveal current limitations, and point to new opportunities for automatic data product discovery research.

      <title>ProEx: A Unified Framework Leveraging Large Language Model with Profile Extrapolation for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The powerful text understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have brought new vitality to general recommendation with implicit feedback. One possible strategy involves generating a unique user (or item) profile from historical interaction data, which is then mapped to a semantic representation in the language space. However, a single-instance profile may be insufficient to comprehensively capture the complex intentions behind a user's interacted items. Moreover, due to the inherent instability of LLMs, a biased or misinterpreted profile could even undermine the original recommendation performance. Consequently, an intuitive solution is to generate multiple profiles for each user (or item), each reflecting a distinct aspect of their characteristics. In light of this, we propose a unified recommendation framework with multi-faceted profile extrapolation (ProEx) in this paper. By leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, we construct multiple distinct profiles for each user and item. These new profiles are subsequently mapped into semantic vectors, extrapolating from the position of the original profile to explore a broader region of the language space. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of environments, where each environment represents a possible linear combination of all profiles. The differences across environments are minimized to reveal the inherent invariance of user preferences. We apply ProEx to three discriminative methods and three generative methods, and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ProEx significantly enhances the performance of these base recommendation models.</description>

      <title>Q${}^2$Forge: Minting Competency Questions and SPARQL Queries for Question-Answering Over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SPARQL query language is the standard method to access knowledge graphs (KGs). However, formulating SPARQL queries is a significant challenge for non-expert users, and remains time-consuming for the experienced ones. Best practices recommend to document KGs with competency questions and example queries to contextualise the knowledge they contain and illustrate their potential applications. In practice, however, this is either not the case or the examples are provided in limited numbers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in conversational agents and are proving to be an attractive solution with a wide range of applications, from simple question-answering about common knowledge to generating code in a targeted programming language. However, training and testing these models to produce high quality SPARQL queries from natural language questions requires substantial datasets of question-query pairs. In this paper, we present Q${}^2$Forge that addresses the challenge of generating new competency questions for a KG and corresponding SPARQL queries. It iteratively validates those queries with human feedback and LLM as a judge. Q${}^2$Forge is open source, generic, extensible and modular, meaning that the different modules of the application (CQ generation, query generation and query refinement) can be used separately, as an integrated pipeline, or replaced by alternative services. The result is a complete pipeline from competency question formulation to query evaluation, supporting the creation of reference query sets for any target KG.</description>

      <title>Osprey: Production-Ready Agentic AI for Safety-Critical Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operating large-scale scientific facilities requires coordinating diverse subsystems, translating operator intent into precise hardware actions, and maintaining strict safety oversight. Language model-driven agents offer a natural interface for these tasks, but most existing approaches are not yet reliable or safe enough for production use. In this paper, we introduce Osprey, a framework for using agentic AI in large, safety-critical facility operations. Osprey is built around the needs of control rooms and addresses these challenges in four ways. First, it uses a plan-first orchestrator that generates complete execution plans, including all dependencies, for human review before any hardware is touched. Second, a coordination layer manages complex data flows, keeps data types consistent, and automatically downsamples large datasets when needed. Third, a classifier dynamically selects only the tools required for a given task, keeping prompts compact as facilities add capabilities. Fourth, connector abstractions and deployment patterns work across different control systems and are ready for day-to-day use. We demonstrate the framework through two case studies: a control-assistant tutorial showing semantic channel mapping and historical data integration, and a production deployment at the Advanced Light Source, where Osprey manages real-time operations across hundreds of thousands of control channels. These results establish Osprey as a production-ready framework for deploying agentic AI in complex, safety-critical environments.</description>

      <title>MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17281v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-disk graph-based indexes are widely used in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems for large-scale, high-dimensional vectors. However, traditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are inefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant vector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to significant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage architecture. Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed by 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the traditional coupled architecture.</description>

      <title>ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</description>
