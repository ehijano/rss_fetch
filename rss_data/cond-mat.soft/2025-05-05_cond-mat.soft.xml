      <title>Myosin-driven advection and actin reorganization control the geometry of confined actomyosin gel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing nanoscale motor proteins to actively control material shape is a promising strategy in nanotechnology and material science. One notable system is the actomyosin network, composed of actin filaments and myosin motor proteins, providing a natural platform for constructing contractile, shape-adaptive materials. While the role of actomyosin in shaping cells has been extensively studied, the reverse question - how boundary shape affects the actomyosin system - remains poorly understood. Here, we present a microfabricated system that reveals how geometrical confinement directs the organization of actomyosin networks within microwells. By combining experimental and numerical analysis, we show that the asymmetric shape of the microwells is transferred to contracted actomyosin gels via myosin-driven actin flow. Furthermore, tuning myosin contractility and actin polymerization rate allows control over the size and shape of actomyosin gels. Our findings provide a bottom-up framework for integrating molecular motors and cytoskeletons into confined architectures to create responsive biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</description>

      <title>Three types of condensation in open wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensation in linear wedges formed by semi-infinite walls is a well-established critical phenomenon characterized by the continuous growth of an adsorbed liquid layer as bulk two-phase coexistence is approached. In this study, we investigate condensation in finite-length wedges open at both ends, demonstrating that the process becomes first-order. The open boundaries and finite geometry induce a remarkably rich phase behavior of the confined fluid, exhibiting three distinct types of condensation, reentrant phenomena, and continuous higher-order transitions between condensation states. Through a detailed macroscopic analysis, we derive the conditions for each type of condensation, classify the global phase diagrams, and explore asymptotic behavior in specific limiting cases. The asymptotic predictions are confirmed by a detailed comparison with the numerical solutions of the governing equations.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling law for active diffusion in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using granular experiments and computer simulations, we investigate the long-time diffusion of active tracers in a broad class of complex media composed of frozen obstacles of diverse structures. By introducing a dimensionless persistence length $Q = v_d \tau_r / d_t$, we propose a modified scaling relation that independently collapses experimental and simulation results across active and passive particles, diverse media, and distinct propulsion mechanisms. Our results reveal a universal active diffusion-structure relation that holds across both equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, providing a simple predictive framework for active diffusion in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Molecular-sized bubbles in a liquid: free energy of formation beyond the capillarity approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transient bubbles that spontaneously appear in a simple liquid using molecular simulations. The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles $W(s)$ from the bubble size distribution $p(s)$ through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: $W(s) = -kT \ln p(s)$. The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show that using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.</description>

      <title>Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV-visible absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex decreases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of collective patterns modulated by non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study memoryless active particles that navigate using visual information. Particle perception is limited by a field of view. As the degree of non-reciprocity in interactions is varied, we can observe the emergence of a zoology of complex collective motion patterns that exhibit significantly different topologies and transport properties. Nematic closed filaments in the form of rings move as chiral active particles. Closed polar filaments with one singular topological point move ballistically, while those with two singular topological points rotate. Open polar filaments behave as persistent random walks. Furthermore, by changing the size of the field of view, we explore the metamorphic process that transforms one structure into another, finding that the process is non-reversible and presents strong hysteric effects. The analysis sheds light on the physics of single-species active particles with non-reciprocal interactions, providing evidence that topological and transport properties are closely related.</description>

      <title>Flow induced intermittent transport shapes colloid filtration in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic phenomenon of filtration is the separation between suspended and liquid phases and it takes place in natural environments (e.g. groundwater, soil, hyporheic zone) and industrial systems (e.g. filtration plants, pharmaceutical industry, hospital care). Porous materials represent excellent filters since they are characterized by a large solid surface to which flowing particles can attach and be retained. Colloidal filtration by porous media is governed by a complex interplay between transport dynamics through intricate pore structures and surface-mediated retention. Yet, classical approaches fail to capture key properties (such as filter spatial heterogeneity) and experimental observations--e.g. non-exponential deposition profiles. A key limitation of such approaches lies in the assumption that particle attachment to solid surfaces occurs at a constant rate over a given length scale, neglecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium, i.e. pore size variability. Here, we develop a multiscale microfluidic model system to directly observe colloidal transport and deposition over more than three orders of magnitude in length--from tens of microns to a meter--within a porous architecture with controlled heterogeneity. By tracking individual colloidal particles within the pores, we reveal intermittent dynamics along each trajectory: particles alternate between long-range "flights" through pore channels and short-range localized "dives" near grain surfaces. During the dives, attachment can occur at a constant rate, but the distributed flight sizes, during which attachment cannot occur, produce anomalous filtration. This is quantified by deposition profiles and breakthrough curves. A stochastic model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW), constrained by experimental data, captures this behavior and links pore structure with macroscopic filtration.</description>

      <title>Particles, trajectories and diffusion: random walks in cooling granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The experimental results are compared with a recently developed theory of sliding wear\cite{ToBe}. Our findings demonstrate that wear on surfaces with roughness below a critical threshold cannot result from crack propagation induced by frictional shear stress in block-substrate asperity contact regions and must, therefore, originate from a different mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay of tangential velocity profiles with distance from a local disturbance in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as the colloidal glass transition is approached. The disturbance, generated by a dimer of superparamagnetic particles rotated by an external magnetic field, enables a precise characterization of the system's response through confocal microscopy and tracking of individual particle dynamics. The tangential velocity profiles exhibit nearly exponential decay with distance. As particle density increases toward the colloidal glass transition, the characteristic length scale derived from exponential fits grows. We also observe that the colloidal particles slip against the rotating dimer, with less slip in samples which are closer to the glass transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the locomotion of a thermally driven elastic two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control that is realized by the position-dependent friction coefficients. In our model, the two spheres are in equilibrium with independent heat baths having different temperatures, causing a heat flow between the two spheres. We generally show that the average velocity of the microswimmer is nonzero when the friction coefficients are position-dependent. Using the method of stochastic thermodynamics, we obtain the entropy production rate and discuss the efficiency of the two-sphere microswimmer. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism highlights the importance of information in active matter and can be a fundamental process in various biological systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>
