      <title>Fusion 3-Categories for Duality Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fusion 3-categorical symmetries for quantum theories in (3+1)d with self-duality defects. Such defects have been realized physically by half-space gauging in theories with 1-form symmetries $A[1]$ for an abelian group $A$, and have found applications in the continuum and the lattice. These fusion 3-categories will be called (generalized) Tambara-Yamagami fusion 3-categories $(\mathbf{3TY})$. We consider the Brauer-Picard and Picard 4-groupoids to construct these categories using a 3-categorical version of the extension theory introduced by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik. These two 4-groupoids correspond to the construction of duality defects either directly in 4d, or from the 5d Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). The Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion 1-categories naturally appears in the aforementioned 4-groupoids and represents enrichments of standard duality defects by (2+1)d TFTs. Our main objective is to study graded extensions of the fusion 3-category $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$. Firstly, we use invertible bimodule 3-categories and the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid. Secondly, we use that the Brauer-Picard 4-groupoid of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$ can be identified with the Picard 4-groupoid of its Drinfeld center. Moreover, the Drinfeld center of $\mathbf{3Vect}(A[1])$, which represents topological defects of the SymTFT, is completely described by a sylleptic strongly fusion 2-category formed by topological surface defects of the SymTFT. These are classified by a finite abelian group equipped with an alternating 2-form. We relate the Picard 4-groupoid of the corresponding braided fusion 3-categories with a generalized Witt group constructed from certain graded braided fusion 1-categories using a twisted Deligne tensor product. We perform explicit computations for $\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4$ graded $\mathbf{3TY}$ categories.</description>

      <title>Admissible weak factorization systems on extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13548v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extriangulated categories, introduced by Nakaoka and Palu, serve as a simultaneous generalization of exact and triangulated categories. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of admissible weak factorization systems and establish a bijection between cotorsion pairs and admissible weak factorization systems in extriangulated categories. Consequently, we give the equivalences between hereditary cotorsion pairs and compatible cotorsion pairs via admissible weak factorization systems under certain conditions in extriangulated categories, thereby generalizing a result by Di, Li, and Liang.</description>

      <title>On functor double $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study double $\infty$-categories of double functors. To this end, we exhibit the cartesian closed structure of the $\infty$-category of double $\infty$-categories and various localizations. We prove a theorem that characterizes the companions and conjoints in functor double $\infty$-categories via the notion of companionable and conjointable 2-cells in double $\infty$-categories. Moreover, we show that under suitable conditions, functor double $\infty$-categories are horizontally closed. Throughout the paper, we highlight a few applications to $(\infty,2)$-category theory and indexed exponentiability.</description>

      <title>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.</description>

      <title>Lebesgue integration on $\sigma$-locales: simple functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a point-free version of the Lebesgue integral for simple functions on $\sigma$-locales. It describes the integral with respect to a measure defined on the coframe of all $\sigma$-sublocales, moving beyond the constraints of Boolean algebras. It also extends the notion of integrable function, usually reserved for measurable functions, to localic general functions.</description>

      <title>Towards All Categorical Symmetries in 2+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the most general gauging operations in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories with finite symmetry groups, which correspond to gapped boundary conditions in 3+1 dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. The classification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological quantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the symmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed extensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations. Additionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue that this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories.</description>

      <title>Formal category theory in $\infty$-equipments I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of proarrow equipments to the $\infty$-categorical setting, termed $\infty$-equipments. These equipments take the form of particular double $\infty$-categories that support a notion of internal formal higher category theory. We will explore several examples of $\infty$-equipments. In particular, we will study the prototypical example given by the $\infty$-equipment of $\infty$-categories, and construct $\infty$-equipments of $\infty$-categories internal to general $\infty$-toposes as well. The final objective of this article is to study the fundamental notions of formal higher category theory within an arbitrary $\infty$-equipment. To this end, we not only follow the classical approach but also expand upon it.</description>

      <title>$\omega$-weak equivalences between weak $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\omega$-weak equivalences between weak $\omega$-categories in the sense of Batanin-Leinster. Our $\omega$-weak equivalences are strict $\omega$-functors satisfying essential surjectivity at every dimension, and when restricted to those between strict $\omega$-categories, they coincide with the weak equivalences in the model category of strict $\omega$-categories defined by Lafont, M\'etayer, and Worytkiewicz. We show that the class of $\omega$-weak equivalences has the 2-out-of-3 property. We also consider a generalisation of $\omega$-weak equivalences, defined as weak $\omega$-functors (in the sense of Garner) satisfying essential surjectivity, and show that this class also has the 2-out-of-3 property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Kechris--Pestov--Todor\v{c}evi\'c correspondence to weak Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} categories and automorphism groups of generic objects. The new ingredient is the weak Ramsey property. We demonstrate the theory on several examples including monoid categories, the category of almost linear orders, and categories of strong embeddings of trees.</description>

      <title>Epimorphisms and Acyclic Types in Univalent Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the epimorphisms in homotopy type theory (HoTT) as the fiberwise acyclic maps and develop a type-theoretic treatment of acyclic maps and types in the context of synthetic homotopy theory as developed in univalent foundations. We present examples and applications in group theory, such as the acyclicity of the Higman group, through the identification of groups with 0-connected, pointed 1-types. Many of our results are formalized as part of the agda-unimath library.</description>
