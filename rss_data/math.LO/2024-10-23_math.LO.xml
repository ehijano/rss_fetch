      <title>Freely adding one layer of quantifiers to a Boolean doctrine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to freely add the first layer of quantifier alternation depth to a Boolean doctrine over a small base category. This amounts to a doctrinal version of Herbrand's theorem for formulas with quantifier alternation depth at most one modulo a universal theory. To achieve this, we characterize, within the doctrinal setting, the classes $A$ of quantifier-free formulas for which there is a model $M$ such that $A$ is precisely the class of formulas whose universal closure is valid in $M$.</description>

      <title>Pantograph: A Machine-to-Machine Interaction Interface for Advanced Theorem Proving, High Level Reasoning, and Data Extraction in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-assisted theorem proving refers to the process of conducting structured reasoning to automatically generate proofs for mathematical theorems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning models in conjunction with proof assistants to perform this task. In this paper, we introduce Pantograph, a tool that provides a versatile interface to the Lean 4 proof assistant and enables efficient proof search via powerful search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In addition, Pantograph enables high-level reasoning by enabling a more robust handling of Lean 4's inference steps. We provide an overview of Pantograph's architecture and features. We also report on an illustrative use case: using machine learning models and proof sketches to prove Lean 4 theorems. Pantograph's innovative features pave the way for more advanced machine learning models to perform complex proof searches and high-level reasoning, equipping future researchers to design more versatile and powerful theorem provers.</description>

      <title>Generic Absoluteness Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the relation between recurrence axioms and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms in light of principles of generic absoluteness and the Ground Axiom.
  M.Viale proved that Martin's Maximum$^{++}$ together with the assumption that there are class many Woodin cardinals implies $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}}\prec_{\Sigma_2}\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}[\mathbb{G}]}$ for a generic $\mathbb{G}$ on any stationary preserving $\mathbb{P}$ which also preserves Bounded Martin's Maximum. We show that a similar but more general conclusion follows from each of $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_{\Sigma_2}$-${\sf RcA}^+$ (which is a fragment of a reformulation of the Maximality Principle for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(\kappa)$), and the existence of the tightly $\mathcal{P}$-Laver-generically huge cardinal.
  While under "$\mathcal{P}=$ all stationary preserving posets", our results are not very much more than Viale's Theorem, for other classes of posets, "$\mathcal{P}=$ all proper posets" or "$\mathcal{P}=$ all ccc posets", for example, our theorems are not at all covered by his theorem.
  The assumptions (and hence also the conclusion) of Viale's Theorem are compatible with the Ground Axiom. In contrast, we show that the assumptions of our theorems (for most of the common settings of $\mathcal{P}$ and with a modification of the large cardinal property involved) imply the negation of the Ground Axiom. This fact is used to show that fragments of Recurrence Axiom $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$-${\sf RcA}^+$ can be different from the corresponding fragments of Maximality Principle ${\sf MP}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$ for $\Gamma=\Pi_2$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Pi_3$.</description>

      <title>Sequential commutation in tracial von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recall that a unitary in a tracial von Neumann algebra is Haar if $\tau(u^n)=0$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We introduce and study a new Borel equivalence relation $\sim_N$ on the set of Haar unitaries in a diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$. Two Haar unitaries $u,v$ in $\mathcal{U}(N)$ are related if there exists a finite path of sequentially commuting Haar unitaries in an ultrapower $N^\mathcal{U}$, beginning at $u$ and ending at $v$. We show that for any diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$, the equivalence relation $\sim_N$ admits either 1 orbit or uncountably many orbits. We characterize property Gamma in terms of path length and number of orbits of $\sim_N$ and also show the existence of non-Gamma II$_1$ factors so that $\sim_N$ admits only 1 orbit. Examples where $\sim_N$ admits uncountably many orbits include $N$ having positive 1-bounded entropy: $h(N)&gt;0$. As a key example, we explicitly describe $\sim_{L(\mathbb{F}_t)}$ for the free group factors. Using these ideas we introduce a numerical invariant for diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras called the commutation diameter, with applications to elementary equivalence classification. We compute lower and upper bounds for the commutation diameter in various examples. Notably we obtain non-trivial lower bounds for the family of arbitrary graph products $N$ of diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras whose underlying graph is connected and has diameter at least 4, and distinguish them up to elementary equivalence from the [CIKE23] exotic factors, despite satisfying $h(N)\leq 0$.</description>
