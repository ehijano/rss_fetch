      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the focusing two-component Hirota equation with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the inverse scattering transform to study a focusing two-component Hirota equation with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity. Through the spectral problem and the adjoint spectral problem, the analyticity properties and symmetry relations of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are systematically investigated. Based on these properties, the discrete spectrum is comprehensively characterized, producing three types of discrete eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients is explored in detail. Furthermore, the inverse scattering problem is formulated through a suitable matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, and the trace formula along with the reconstruction formula for the potential function are derived. The reflectionless condition facilitates the successful construction of N-soliton solution. Finally, various types of solitons are obtained by considering different types of discrete eigenvalues and their combinations, and the interactions of these solitons are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A search for integrable evolution equations with Lax pairs over the octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four new integrable evolutions equations with operator Lax pairs are found for an octonion variable. The method uses a scaling ansatz to set up a general polynomial form for the evolution equation and the Lax pair, using KdV and mKdV scaling weights. A condition for linear differential operators to be a Lax pair over octonions is formulated and solved for the unknown coefficients in the polynomials.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the defocusing local-and-nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with non-zero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the Riemann-Hilbert method, the theory of inverse scattering transform is developed for the defocusing local-and-nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov system) with non-zero boundary conditions. First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the inverse problem, and the reconstruction formulas are derived by considering arbitrary simple zeros of scattering coefficients. In the reflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.</description>

      <title>On a family of Poisson brackets on gl(n) compatible with the Sklyanin bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of compatible quadratic Poisson brackets on gl(n), generalizing the Sklyanin one. For any of the brackets in the family, the argument shift determines the compatible linear bracket. The main interest for us is the use of the bi-Hamiltonian formalism for some pencils from this family, as a method for constructing involutive subalgebras for a linear bracket starting by the center of the quadratic bracket. We give some interesting examples of families of this type.
  We construct the centers of the corresponding quadratic brackets using the antidiagonal principal minors of the Lax matrix. Special attention should be paid to the condition of the log-canonicity of the brackets of these minors with all the generators of the Poisson algebra of the family under consideration. A similar property arises in the context of Poisson structures consistent with cluster transformations.</description>

      <title>Dirac-isotonic oscillators in (1 + 1) and (2 + 1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Dirac oscillator in $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$ dimensions and present its generalizations in the spirit of the isotonic oscillator. In $(1+1)$ dimensions, the Dirac oscillator returns to quantum harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, while its generalization maps to the isotonic oscillator. We describe exact solutions of these generalized systems and also present their non-relativistic limits. Finally, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we show that a generalized Dirac oscillator in $(2+1)$ dimensions can be mapped to an anti-Jaynes-Cummings-like Hamiltonian in which the spin operators couple with the supercharges.</description>

      <title>Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peakon equations have garnered significant attention due to their rich mathematical structure and potential applications in various physical contexts. In this study, we extend the well-known b-family system, $m_t+m_xv+bv_xm=0,\quad m=(1-\partial_x^2)v,$ to a more general higher-order one with $m=(1-\partial_x^2)^Jv$ for an arbitrary positive integer $J$. We conjecture the existence of a b-independent pseudo-peakon solution of the form, $v=c\left(1+\left|x-ct\right|+\sum_{i=1}^{J-2}a_i\left|x-ct\right|^{i+1}\right)\mbox{\rm e}^{-\left|x-ct\right|}$ which includes $J-1$ arbitrary constants $a_1,\ a_2,\ \cdots,\ a_{J-1}$ for all $J\geq 2$. In additional to the b-independent psudo-peakon solution, we conclude that there are one b-independent peakon, one b-dependent peakon (for odd J) or two b-dependent peakons (for even J), and $J-3$ (for odd J) or $J-4$ (for even J) complex peakons. This comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights into the structure and behavior of peakons and pseudo-peakons within the extended b-family framework.</description>

      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>Duality of Navier-Stokes to a one-dimensional system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe fluid motion via a high-dimensional, nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their fundamental role, their behavior in turbulent regimes remains poorly understood, and their global regularity is an open Millennium Problem. Here, we show that \textbf{the NS system can be transformed to a nonlinear equation for the momentum loop \( \vec{P}(\theta, t)\), reducing the original problem in \( \mathbb{R}_3 \) to a one-dimensional problem}. A key consequence is the \textbf{No Explosion Theorem}, which rules out finite-time singularities for stochastic initial conditions, suggesting a pathway to proving NS regularity for deterministic data. Additionally, we derive an exact solution of the momentum loop equation, the \textbf{Euler ensemble}, which describes the \textbf{asymptotic state of decaying turbulence}. This solution, validated by numerical and experimental data, replaces heuristic turbulence models with an analytically derived structure. While the Euler ensemble solves a specific boundary problem, its universality as an attractor remains an open question. By reducing NS to a \textbf{nonlinear equation} on \( S_1 \), this work opens new pathways toward resolving turbulence and fluid mechanics' fundamental challenges.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In numerous subjects there are instances of dynamical variables that change in discrete time. One such example is a population's size, which changes in discrete generations which we label by $n$ ($= 0, 1, 2, . ..$). There are some exactly soluble cases where the population's size at discrete time $n$, written $x_{n}$, can be related to a different problem, where change occurs in continuous time, $t$, and the population's size is then written as $x(t)$. The relation is that $x(t = n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we say the two models are 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations. This exposes structural similarities and sometimes appreciable structural differences of discrete and continuous time dynamics. We present cases of such equivalences for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous problems. Beyond this, when the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified so there is no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate continuous time solution that can capture rapid change, such as growth, of $x_{n}$. Additionally, in some discrete time problems, the solution has an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n \rightarrow n + 1$. We show that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is to become complex. We give concrete examples of this 'complexification' of the continuous time solution, which is real at $t = 0,1,2,...$ but is complex away from the integers.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence relations describe how to add a single parameter $z$, to specific subsets of Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on $z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as rectangular because the monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the zero mode method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>
