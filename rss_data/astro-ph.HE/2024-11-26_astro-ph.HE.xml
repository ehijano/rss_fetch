      <title>Simulations of Eccentricity Growth in Compact Binary Accretion Disks with MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of four magnetohydrodynamic simulations and one alpha-disk simulation of accretion disks in a compact binary system, neglecting vertical stratification and assuming a locally isothermal equation of state. We demonstrate that in the presence of net vertical field, disks that extend out to the 3:1 mean motion resonance grow eccentricity in full MHD in much the same way as in hydrodynamical disks. Hence turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) does not impede the tidally-driven growth of eccentricity in any meaningful way. However, we find two important differences with alpha-disk theory. First, in MHD, eccentricity builds up in the inner disk with a series of episodes of radial disk breaking into two misaligned eccentric disks, separated by a region of circular orbits. Standing eccentric waves are often present in the inner eccentric disk. Second, the successful spreading of an accretion disk with MRI turbulence out to the resonant radius is nontrivial, and much harder than spreading an alpha-disk. This is due to the tendency to develop over-dense rings in which tidal torques overwhelm MRI transport and truncate the disk too early. We believe that the inability to spread the disk sufficiently was the reason why our previous attempt to excite eccentricity via the 3:1 mean motion resonance with MHD failed. Exactly how MHD disks successfully spread outward in compact binary systems is an important problem that has not yet been understood.</description>

      <title>Transforming Antarctic Ice into a Cherenkov Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we describe how the IceCube Neutrino Observatory transformed a cubic kilometer of natural ice at the geographic South Pole into a neutrino telescope. The concept of using the neutrino as an astronomical messenger is as old as the neutrino itself, and the challenge to open this new window on the high-energy universe was technological in nature. We discuss how IceCube was constructed and how the detector operates, including some detail on the 5,484 optical sensors that comprise the array. We highlight some of the primary results of the experiment, including the discovery of a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, the observation of the first high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, and the observation of our Galaxy in neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Once a giant, (almost) always a giant: Partial Tidal Disruption Events of Giant Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) of giant stars by supermassive black holes (SMBH) differ significantly from those of main sequence ones. Most (all for SMBH of more than a~ few times 10^5 m_\odot) giant-TDEs are partial: only a fraction of the envelope is torn apart. The dense stellar core and the rest of the envelope remain intact. In this work, we explore, using the stellar evolution code MESA, the fate of the remnants. We find that after a short period, comparable to the thermal time scale, the remnant returns to a giant structure with a radius comparable to the progenitor giant one, a slightly larger luminosity (as compared with a regular giant with the same mass), and a comparable lifetime until it collapses to a white dwarf. If such a giant with a mass less than approx 0.9 m_\odot is discovered, it can be identified as an outlier - a giant that is too light for the current age of the Universe. If the remnant orbit is not perturbed significantly during the encounter, the remnant will undergo successive partial tidal disruptions until its mass is $0.6-0.7 m_\odot$. We expect a few dozen to a few hundred such remnants in the Galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>New Insights with XRISM &amp; Cloudy: A novel Column Density Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, yet powerful column density diagnostic for plasmas enabled by X-ray microcalorimeter observations. With the recent developments of the spectral simulation code Cloudy, inspired by the high spectral resolution of XRISM and Athena, we make predictions for the intensity ratio of the resolved fine-structure lines Ly$\alpha_1$ and Ly$\alpha_2$ of H-like ions. We show that this ratio can be observationally constrained and used as a plasma column density indicator. We demonstrate this with a XRISM observation of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3. This diagnostic is useful for a wide range of X-ray emitting plasmas either collisionally or radiatively ionized.</description>

      <title>Puzzling High-Velocity Calcium Absorption Features Of Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption features Ca II NIR and Ca II H&amp;K of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by their strong high-velocity features (HVFs). We find that, for these two features of calcium there is a puzzling anti-correlation between the line strengths of HVF and photospheric (PHO) components, and an unexpected positive correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of HVF and PHO components. In comparison, HVFs of Si II $\lambda$6355 and O I $\lambda$7773 show a positive correlation between the line strengths of HVF and PHO components, and no clear correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of the two components. The differences may be associated with the fact that calcium was mostly synthesized in deeper layers than silicon and oxygen, and thus experienced much more serious blocking by substances in outer layers. These observations can shed light on the physics of HVFs.</description>

      <title>Structure Functions of Rotation Measures Revealing the Origin of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure function (SF) analysis is an effective tool for diagnosing the time dependence of Faraday rotation measures (RMs), revealing the astrophysical environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). This work applies the SF analysis to seven repeating FRBs and one binary system PSR B1744-24A. The results support that both PSR B1744-24A and FRB 20201124A exhibit a geometric component, arising from the relative orientation of sight lines through an ordered magnetic field, and a flat statistical component, induced by stochastic fluctuations in free electron density and magnetic fields. Notably, the periodic behavior of the geometric component is driven by the binary orbital motion, and the statistical component aligns with the RM scatter derived from the pulse depolarization. These findings affirm that the periodic geometric component in RM SF can serve as a robust indicator for the existence of binary companions.</description>

      <title>A 44-minute periodic radio transient in a supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a newly discovered class of radio emitters with yet incomprehensibly long rotation periods, ranging from minutes to hours. The astrophysical nature of their isolated counterparts remains undetermined. We report a new LPT, DART J1832-0911 (2656.23 $\pm$ 0.15 s period), the first evidence associating such objects to supernova remnants (SNRs). Its dispersion measure distance aligns well with the distance of the SNR, confirming its origin from a supernova explosion. The source displays either phase-locked circularly polarized emission or nearly 100% linear polarization in radio bands. No detectable optical counterpart was found, even with a 10 m class telescope. The J1832-0911's SNR association, stable, highly polarized emission, and abnormally long period strongly favor its origin from a young neutron star, whose spin has been braked, possibly by interaction with supernova's fallback materials. This discovery provides critical insights into the nature of ultra-long period transients and their evolutionary link to stellar remnants.</description>

      <title>Signature of Triaxially Precessing Magnetars in Gamma-ray Burst X-Ray Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit plateaus, which can be explained by the internal dissipation of a newborn millisecond magnetar wind. In the early phase of these newborn magnetars, the magnetic inclination angle undergoes periodic changes due to precession, leading to periodic modulation of the injection luminosity due to magnetic dipole radiation. This may result in quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on the plateaus. In this paper, we identify four GRBs with regular flux variations on their X-ray afterglow plateaus from Swift/XRT data before November 2023, three of which exhibit periodicity. Based on the likelihood of supporting a precessing magnetar as the central engine, we classify them into three categories: Gold (GRB 060202 and GRB 180620A), Silver (GRB 050730), and Bronze (GRB 210610A). We invoke a model of magnetic dipole radiation emitted by a triaxially freely precessing magnetar whose spin-down is dominated by electromagnetic radiation, to fit the light curves. Our model successfully reproduces the light curves of these four GRBs, including the regular flux variations on the plateaus and their periodicity (if present). Our work provides further evidence for early precession in newborn millisecond magnetars in GRBs.</description>

      <title>Depolarization by jet precession in early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization observations provide a unique way to probe the nature of jet magnetic fields in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Currently, some GRBs have been detected to be polarized in their early optical afterglows. However, the measured polarization degrees (PDs) of these GRBs are much lower than those predicted by theoretical models. In this work, we investigate the depolarization induced by jet precession in combination with the measured PDs of the GRB early optical afterglows in the reverse shock (RS) dominated phase ($\sim 10^2-10^3 \,{\rm s}$). We calculate the PDs of RS emission with and without jet precession in both magnetic field configurations, i.e., aligned and toroidal magnetic fields, and meanwhile explore the effect of different parameters on the PDs. We find that the PDs are slightly affected by the configurations of the ordered magnetic fields and are positively related to the precession period. Moreover, the PDs are sensitive to the observed angle and the measured low PDs favor a small one. Thus, as one of the plausible origins of the structured jets, jet precession could be considered as an alternative mechanism for the low PDs observed in GRB early optical afterglows.</description>

      <title>Searching radio signals from two magnetars and a high-magnetic field pulsar and the serendipitous discovery of a new radio pulsar PSR J1935+2200</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are slowly rotating, highly magnetized young neutron stars that can show transient radio phenomena for radio pulses and fast radio bursts. We conducted radio observations of from two magnetars SGR J1935+2154 and 3XMM J185246.6+003317 and a high-magnetic field pulsar PSR J1846$-$0258 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We performed single pulse and periodicity searches and did not detect radio signals from them. From the piggyback data recorded by other FAST telescope beams when we observed the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, we serendipitously discovered a new radio pulsar, PSR J1935+2200. We carried out the follow-up observations and obtained the timing solution based on these new observations and the archive FAST data. PSR J1935+2200 is an isolated old pulsar, with a spin period of $0.91$s, a spin-period derivative of $9.19 \times 10^{-15}$~s~s$^{-1}$, and a characteristic age of $1.57$ Myr. It is a weak pulsar with a flux density of 9.8 $\mu$Jy at 1.25 GHz. Discovery of a new pulsar from the long FAST observations of 30 minutes implies that there may be more weak older pulsars in the Galactic disk to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey: VI. The discovery of 473 new pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is the most sensitive telescope at the L-band (1.0-1.5GHz) and has been used to carry out the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey in the last 5 years. Up to now, the survey has covered one-fourth of the planned areas within $10^{\circ}$ from the Galactic plane visible by the FAST, and discovered 751 pulsars. After the first publishing of the discovery of 201 pulsars and one rotating radio transient (RRAT) in 2021 and 76 RRATs in 2023, here we report the discovery of 473 new pulsars from the FAST GPPS survey, including 137 new millisecond field pulsars and 30 new RRATs. We find that 34 millisecond pulsars discovered by the GPPS survey which can be timed with a precision better than 3~$\mu$s by using FAST 15-minute observations and can be used for the pulsar timing arrays. The GPPS survey has discovered 8 pulsars with periods greater than 10~s including one with 29.77~s. The profiles of integrated profiles of pulsars and individual pulses of RRATs are presented. During the FAST GPPS survey, we also detected previously known pulsars and updated parameters for 45 pulsars. In addition, we discover 2 fast radio bursts plus one probable case with high dispersion measures indicating their extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Very-high-energy Diffuse Gamma-ray Emissions from the Galactic Plane with LHAASO-WCDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is a very important tool used to study the propagation and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work, we report the measurements of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, covering Galactic longitudes from $15^{\circ}$ to $235^{\circ}$ and latitudes from $-5^{\circ}$ to $+5^{\circ}$, in an energy range of 1 TeV to 25 TeV, with the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). After masking the sky regions of known sources, the diffuse emission is detected with $24.6\sigma$ and $9.1\sigma$ significance in the inner Galactic plane($15^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;125^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$) and outer Galactic plane ($125^{\circ}&lt;l&lt;235^{\circ}$, $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$), respectively. The WCDA spectra in both regions can be well described by a power-law function, with spectral indices of $-2.67\pm0.05_{\rm stat}$ in the inner region and $-2.83\pm0.19_{\rm stat}$ in the outer region, respectively. Combined with the Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) measurements at higher energies, a clear softening of the spectrum is found in the inner region, with change of spectral indices by $\sim0.5$ at a break energy around $30$ TeV.The fluxes of the diffuse emission are higher by a factor of $1.5-2.7$ than the model prediction assuming local CR spectra and the gas column density, which are consistent with those measured by the KM2A. Along Galactic longitude, the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission shows deviation from that of the gas column density. The spectral shape of the diffuse emission are possibly variation in different longitude region. The results indicate further that the conventional model prediction of diffuse emission from cosmic ray interactions is not enough to account for the observations.</description>

      <title>The fate of EMRI-IMRI pairs in AGN accretion disks: long-term simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) are important gravitational-wave (GW) sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). So far, their formation and evolution have been studied independently, but recent theories suggest that stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBHs) can coexist in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which indicates that EMRIs and IMRIs may form in the same place. Considering the likely encounter of the sBH and IMBH during the migration in the AGN disk, Paper I (Peng &amp; Chen 2023) shows that a gap-opening IMBH can drive a surrounding sBH to migrate synchronously. In this work, we extend the study in Paper I with more sophisticated model. We first use the 3D hydrodynamical simulation to study the co-evolution of the disk and the migration, and found that although the inner disk is partially accreted, the gaseous torque together with the tidal torque of IMBH can keep the synchronized migrate, until $\sim 10$ Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We further use a relativistic three-body simulation to study the final fate of the sBH in the GW-dominated regime, and found that in most cases the sBH can be either captured or kicked out by the IMBH, which will result in two successive IMRIs or an EMRI followed by an IMRI. Such successive EMRIs and IMRIs will bring rich information about the formation and evolution of sBHs and IMBHs in AGNs.</description>

      <title>An Optically Led Search for Kilonovae to z$\sim$0.3 with the Kilonova and Transients Program (KNTraP)</title>

Abstract: Compact binary mergers detectable in gravitational waves can be accompanied by a kilonova, an electromagnetic transient powered by radioactive decay of newly synthesised r-process elements. A few kilonova candidates have been observed during short gamma-ray burst follow-up, and one found associated with a gravitational wave detection, GW170817. However, robust kilonova candidates are yet to be found in un-triggered, wide-field optical surveys, that is, a search not requiring an initial gravitational wave or gamma-ray burst trigger. Here we present the first observing run for the Kilonova and Transients Program (KNTraP) using the Dark Energy Camera. The first KNTraP run ran for 11 nights, covering 31 fields at a nightly cadence in two filters. The program can detect transients beyond the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA horizon, be agnostic to the merger orientation, avoid the Sun and/or Galactic plane, and produces high cadence multi-wavelength light curves. The data were processed nightly in real-time for rapid identification of transient candidates, allowing for follow-up of interesting candidates before they faded away. Three fast-rising candidates were identified in real-time, however none had the characteristics of the kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW170817 or with the expected evolution for kilonovae from our fade-rate models. After the run, the data were reprocessed, then subjected to stringent filtering and model fitting to search for kilonovae offline. Multiple KNTraP runs (3+) are expected to detect kilonovae via this optical-only search method. No kilonovae were detected in this first KNTraP run using our selection criteria, constraining the KN rate to $R &lt; 1.8\times10^{5}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Long Pulse by Short Central Engine: Prompt emission from expanding dissipation rings in the jet front of gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have challenged the long-held opinion that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is determined by the activity epochs of the central engine. Specifically, the observations of GRB 230307A have revealed a different scenario in which the duration of the prompt emission is predominantly governed by the energy dissipation process following a brief initial energy injection from the central engine. In this paper, we explore a mechanism where the energy injection from the central engine initially causes turbulence in a small region and radiates locally. This turbulence then propagates to more distant regions and radiates. Consequently, the emission regions form concentric rings that extend outward. Using an idealized toy model, we show that such a mechanism, initiated by a pulsed energy injection, can produce a prompt emission light curve resembling a single broad pulse exhibiting the typical softer-wider/softer-later feature. Under some parameters, the main characteristics of the GRB 230307A spectra and light curves can be reproduced by the toy model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of BL Lacertae During a Large Submillimeter Outburst and Low X-Ray Polarization State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023 October-November, the blazar BL Lacertae underwent a very large-amplitude submm outburst. The usual single-zone leptonic model with the lower energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fit by the synchrotron emission from one distribution of relativistic electrons in the jet and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of lower energy photons from the synchrotron radiation in the jet itself (synchrotron self-Compton or SSC) or those from the broad line region and torus by the same distribution of electrons cannot satisfactorily fit the broadband SED with simultaneous data at submm--optical--X-ray--GeV energies. Furthermore, simultaneous observations with IXPE indicate the X-ray polarization is undetected. We consider two different synchrotron components, one for the high flux in the submm wavelengths and another for the data at the optical band, which are supposedly due to two separate distributions of electrons. In that case, the optical emission is dominated by the synchrotron radiation from one electron distribution while the X-rays are mostly due to SSC process by another, which may result in low polarization fraction due to the IC scattering. We show that such a model can fit the broadband SED satisfactorily as well as explain the low polarization fraction at the X-rays.</description>

      <title>Optical monitoring in southern blazars. Analysis of variability and spectral colour behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the optical monitoring of 18 southern blazars in the V and R Johnson-Cousins bands. Our main objective is to study the variations in the optical flux and theis relationship with the colour and spectral variabilities. The optical observations were acquired with the 2.15 m "Jorge Sahade" telescope, CASLEO, Argentina.The whole campaign comprised from 2014 April to 2019 September. In addition, X-ray data were taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Swift/XRT databases, and gamma-ray data were taken from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope 3FGL catalogue. From the total of 18 blazars, we found variability in each one of the time-scales considired for 6 blazars (PKS 0208-512, PKS 1116-46, PKS 1440-389, PKS 1510-089, PKS 2005-489, and PKS 2155-304). In particular, from the colour-magnitude and the multiwavelength analysis, we found that PKS 1510-089 (flat-spectrum radio quasar) is undergoing an activity phase. For the case of PKS 2005-489 (BL Lac), this blazar is in a quiescent state, in which it has been for more than a decade, and it is compatible with its bluer-when-brighter moderate tendency, possibly due to the presence of shocks within the jet.</description>

      <title>4FGL J1544.2$-$2554: a new spider pulsar candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Spider pulsars are millisecond pulsars in tight binary systems, in which a low-mass companion star is heated and ablated by the pulsar wind. Their observations allow one to study stellar evolution with formation of millisecond pulsars and physics of superdense matter in neutron stars. However, spiders are rare due to difficulties of their discovery using typical radio search techniques. The Fermi $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J1544.2$-$2554 was recently proposed as a pulsar candidate, and its likely X-ray and optical counterparts with the galactic coordinates $l\approx344.\!\!^\circ76$, $b\approx22.\!\!^\circ59$ and the magnitude $G\approx20.6$ were found using the eROSITA and Gaia surveys. Aims. Our goals are to study whether the source is a new spider pulsar and to estimate its fundamental parameters. Methods. We performed the first optical time-series multi-band photometry of the object. We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for its brightness periodicity and fitted its light curves with a model of direct heating of the binary companion by the pulsar wind. Results. The source shows a strong brightness variability with a period of $\approx$ 2.724 h and an amplitude of $\gtrsim$ 2.5 mag, and its light curves have a single broad peak per period. These features are typical for spider pulsars. The curves are well fitted by the direct heating model, resulting in an orbit inclination of the presumed spider system of $\approx 83^\circ$, a companion mass of $\approx 0.1$ M$_\odot$, its ''day-side'' and ''night-side'' temperatures of $\approx 7200$ K and $\approx 3000$ K, a Roche-lobe filling factor of $\approx 0.65$ and a distance of $\approx 2.1$ kpc. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that 4FGL J1544.2$-$2554 is a spider pulsar. This encourages searches for the pulsar millisecond pulsations in the radio and $\gamma$-rays to confirm its nature.</description>

      <title>Polarization of synchrotron radiation from blazar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) launch relativistic jets that shine through the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Blazars are a subclass of AGN where non-thermal radiation from the jet is strongly beamed, as the jet is directed nearly toward the observer. Multifrequency polarimetry is emerging as a powerful probe of blazar jets, especially with the advent of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) space observatory. IXPE mostly targeted high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazars, where both optical and X-ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation from a population of non-thermal electrons. Observations of HSP blazars show that the polarization degree is strongly chromatic ($\Pi_{\rm X}/\Pi_{\rm O} \sim 2-7$), whereas the electric vector position angle (EVPA) is nearly independent of the observed frequency ($\Psi_{\rm X}\simeq\Psi_{\rm O}$). The strong chromaticity of the polarization degree was interpreted as an evidence that non-thermal electrons are accelerated by shocks. We present an alternative scenario that naturally explains IXPE observations. We study the polarization of synchrotron radiation from stationary axisymmetric jets viewed nearly on-axis. We show that the polarization degree increases significantly at high photon frequencies, as the distribution of the emitting electrons becomes softer, whereas the EVPA is nearly constant. The chromaticity of the polarization degree is much stronger in axisymmetric jets than in the case of a uniform magnetic field. Our results show that the topology of the electromagnetic fields is key to interpret multifrequency polarimetric observations of blazar jets. On the other hand, these observations may be less sensitive than previously thought to the specific particle acceleration process (e.g., shocks or magnetic reconnection).</description>

      <title>Long term monitoring of FRB~20121102 with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope and multi-wavelength campaigns including INTEGRAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin(s) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), mysterious radio bursts coming from extragalactic distances, remains unknown. Multi-wavelength observations are arguably the only way to answer this question unambiguously. We attempt to detect hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray counterparts to one of the most active FRB sources, FRB20121102, as well as improve understanding of burst properties in radio through a long-term monitoring campaign using the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT). Multi-wavelength campaigns involving the International Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) satellite, the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Observatory, the optical telescopes at the Observatoire de Haute Provence as well as Arecibo were conducted between 2017 and 2019. In 2017, the telescopes were scheduled to observe simultaneously between Sept 24-29. We specifically used the Fast Response Enhanced CCDs for the optical observations to ensure a high time resolution. In 2019, we changed the strategy to instead conduct ToO observations on INTEGRAL and other available facilities upon positive detection triggers from the NRT. In the 2017 campaign, FRB20121102 was not in its burst activity window. We obtain a 5-sigma optical flux limit of 12 mJy ms using the GASP and a 3-sigma limit from OHP T120cm R-band image of R=22.2 mag of any potential persistent emission not associated to radio bursts. In the 2019 campaign, we have simultaneous INTEGRAL data with 11 radio bursts from the NRT and Arecibo. We obtain a 5-sigma upper limit of 2.7e-7 erg/cm2 in the 25-400 keV energy range for contemporary radio and high energy bursts, and a 5-sigma upper limit of 3.8e-11 erg/cm2 for permanent emission in the 25-100 keV energy range. In addition, we report on the regular observations from NRT between 2016-2020, which accounts for 119 additional radio bursts from FRB20121102. We present an updated fit of the periodic active window of 154+/-2 days.</description>

      <title>Relativistically Magnetized Collisionless Shocks in Pair Plasma: I. Solitons, Chaos, and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, energy dissipation does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.</description>

      <title>Pulse Profiles of Accreting Neutron Stars from GRMHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsed X-ray emission from the neutron star surface acts as a window to study the state of matter in the neutron star interior. For accreting millisecond pulsars, the surface X-ray emission is generated from the `hotspots', which are formed as a result of magnetically channeled accretion flow hitting the stellar surface. The emission from these hotspots is modulated by stellar rotation giving rise to pulsations. Using global three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of the star-disk system, we investigate the accretion hotspots and the corresponding X-ray pulse properties of accreting millisecond pulsars with dipolar magnetic fields. The accretion spot morphologies in our simulations are entirely determined by the accretion columns and vary as a function of the stellar magnetic inclination. For lower inclinations, the hotspots are shaped like crescents around the magnetic axis. As we increase the inclination angle, the crescents transform into elongated bars close to the magnetic pole. We model the X-ray pulses resulting from the accretion hotspots using general-relativistic ray tracing calculations and quantify the root mean square variability of the pulsed signal. The pulse amplitudes obtained from our simulations usually range between 1 - 12% rms and are consistent with the values observed in accreting millisecond pulsars. We find that the turbulent accretion flow in the GRMHD simulations introduces significant broadband variability on a timescale similar to the stellar rotational period. We also explore the impact of electron scattering absorption and show that, along with being a key factor in determining the pulse characteristics, this also introduces significant additional variability and higher harmonics in the bolometric light curve of the accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Detection of X-ray Emission from a Bright Long-Period Radio Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission on timescales thousands of times longer than radio pulsars. Several models had been proposed implicating either a strong magnetic field neutron star, isolated white dwarf pulsar, or a white dwarf binary system with a low-mass companion. While several models for LPTs also predict X-ray emission, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10-20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832-0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. The X-ray and radio luminosities are correlated and vary by several orders of magnitude. These properties are unique amongst known Galactic objects and require a new explanation. We consider a $\gtrsim0.5$ Myr old magnetar with a $\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G crustal field, or an extremely magnetised white dwarf in a binary system with a dwarf companion, to be plausible explanations for ASKAP J1832-0911, although both explanations pose significant challenges to formation and emission theories. The X-ray detection also establishes a new class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients of luminosity $10^{33}$ erg/s associated with exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the kiloparsec-scale jets of nearby radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies have long been considered as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Recent analyses of the UHECR spectrum, composition, and arrival directions indicate that the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A, could be linked to the reported dipole anisotropy, though the mechanism underlying the acceleration remains elusive. In this Letter, we explore UHECR acceleration in the kiloparsec-scale jets of radio galaxies, exemplified by Centaurus A. Using high-resolution relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic and test-particle simulations without sub-grid physics, we investigate the acceleration of the highest-energy particles in the turbulent sheath of a fast-moving jet. Our findings demonstrate that acceleration close to the maximum theoretical expectation is possible. When extrapolated to nearby radio galaxies, our results suggest that the kiloparsec-scale jets of Centaurus A could account for the dipole anisotropy in UHECRs, while more potent Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxies may account for the observed UHECR spectrum with a rigidity cutoff at a few Exavolts.</description>

      <title>The impact of resistivity on the variability of black hole accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The accretion of magnetized plasma onto black holes is a complex and dynamic process, where the magnetic field plays a crucial role. The amount of magnetic flux accumulated near the event horizon significantly impacts the accretion flow behavior. Resistivity, a measure of how easily magnetic fields can dissipate, is thought to be a key factor influencing this process. This work explores the influence of resistivity on accretion flow variability. We investigate simulations reaching the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) limit and those with an initial multi-loop magnetic field configuration. Methods. We employ 3D resistive general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to model the accretion process under various regimes, where resistivity has a global uniform value. Results. Our findings reveal distinct flow behaviors depending on resistivity. High resistivity simulations never achieve the MAD state, indicating a disturbed magnetic flux accumulation process. Conversely, low resistivity simulations converge towards the ideal MHD limit. The key results are: i) For the standard MAD model, resistivity plays a minimal role in flow variability, suggesting that flux eruption events dominate the dynamics. ii) High resistivity simulations exhibit strong magnetic field diffusion into the disk, rearranging efficient magnetic flux accumulation from the accretion flow. iii) In multi-loop simulations, resistivity significantly reduces flow variability, which was not expected. However, magnetic flux accumulation becomes more variable due to frequent reconnection events at very low resistivity values. Conclusions. This study shows that resistivity affects how much the flow is distorted due to magnetic field dissipation. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between magnetic field accumulation, resistivity, variability and the dynamics of black hole accretion.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes ``dangerous''. We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as ``red nugget relics'', as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples). Our work generally supports the Gaia hypothesis, where the development of life on a planet (and resulting oxygenation of the atmosphere) causes the environment to become more stable against potential extinction events in the future.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-virial Gas? II: Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a super-virial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) $\sim7$ in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy-formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\alpha$, SiXIV K$\alpha$, and NeX K$\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent simulation results.</description>

      <title>An upgraded GMRT and MeerKAT study of radio relics in the low mass merging cluster PSZ2 G200.95-28.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse radio sources known as radio relics are direct tracers of shocks in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. PSZ2 G200.95-28.16, a low-mass merging cluster($\textrm{M}_{500} = (2.7 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{14}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) features a prominent radio relic, first identified by Kale et al. 2017. We name this relic as the Seahorse. The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey has confirmed two additional radio relics, R2 and R3 in this cluster. We present new observations of this cluster with the Upgraded GMRT at 400 and 650 MHz paired with the Chandra X-ray data. The largest linear sizes for the three relics are~1.53 Mpc, 1.12~kpc, and 340~kpc. All three radio relics are polarized at 1283~MHz. Assuming the diffusive shock acceleration model, the spectral indices of the relics imply shock Mach Numbers of $3.1 \pm 0.8$ and $2.8 \pm 0.9$ for the Seahorse and R2, respectively. The Chandra X-ray surface brightness map shows two prominent subclusters, but the relics are not perpendicular to the likely merger axis as typically observed; no shocks are detected at the locations of the relics. We discuss the possible merger scenarios in light of the low mass of the cluster and the radio and X-ray properties of the relics. The relic R2 follows the correlation known in the radio relic power and cluster mass plane, but the Seahorse and R3 relics are outliers. We have also discovered a radio ring in our 650~MHz uGMRT image that could be an Odd radio circle candidate.</description>

      <title>Triple Evolution Pathways to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Insights from V404 Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object lives for a short time at the termination of the CEE phase and alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles necessitates addressing dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile that is closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide assistance for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5&lt;!PCT!&gt; for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be envisaged that the optimal indicator can provide insights into the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Material mixing in pulsar wind nebulae of massive runaway stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we quantitatively examine the manner pulsar wind, supernova ejecta and defunct stellar wind materials distribute and melt together into plerions. We performed 2.5D MHD simulations of the entire evolution of their stellar surroundings and different scenarios are explored, whether the star dies as a red supergiant and Wolf Rayet supernova progenitors, and whether it moved with velocity 20 km/s or 40 km/s through the ISM. Within the post explosion, early 10 kyr, the H burning products rich red supergiant wind only mixes by &lt;= 20 per cent, due to its dense circumstellar medium filling the progenitor bow shock trail, still unaffected by the supernova blastwave. Wolf Rayet materials, enhanced in C, N, O elements, distribute circularly for the 35 Mo star moving at 20 km/s and oblongly at higher velocities, mixing efficiently up to 80 per cent. Supernova ejecta, filled with Mg, Si, Ca, Ti and Fe, remain spherical for longer times at 20 km/s but form complex patterns at higher progenitor speeds due to earlier interaction with the bow shock, in which they mix more efficiently. The pulsar wind mixing is more efficient for Wolf Rayet (25 per cent) than red supergiant progenitors (20 per cent). This work reveals that the past evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar environments critically shapes the internal distribution of chemical elements on plerionic supernova remnants, and, therefore, governs the origin of the various emission mechanisms at work therein. This is essential for interpreting multi-frequency observations of atomic and molecular spectral lines, such as in optical, infrared, and soft X rays.</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation and energy transport in global simulations of magneto-thermal turbulence in the stratified intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The magneto-thermal instability (MTI) is one of many possible drivers of stratified turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) outskirts of galaxy clusters, where the background temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity. This instability occurs because of the fast anisotropic conduction of heat along magnetic field lines; but to what extent it impacts the ICM dynamics, energetics and overall equilibrium is still a matter of debate. Aims. This work aims at understanding MTI turbulence in an astrophysically stratified ICM atmosphere, its saturation mechanism, and its ability to carry energy and to provide non-thermal pressure support. Methods. We perform a series of 2D and 3D numerical simulations of the MTI in global spherical models of stratified ICM, thanks to the finite-volume code IDEFIX, using Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamics. We use volume-, shell-averaged and spectral diagnostics to study the saturation mechanism of the MTI, and its radial transport energy budget. Results. The MTI is found to saturate through a dominant balance between injection and dissipation of available potential energy, which amounts to marginalising the Braginskii heat flux but not the background temperature gradient itself. Accordingly, the strength and injection length of MTI-driven turbulence exhibit clear dependencies on the thermal diffusivity. The MTI drives cluster-size motions with Mach numbers up to $\mathcal{M} \sim 0.3$, even in presence of strong stable entropy stratification. We show that such mildly compressible flows can provide about $\sim 15\%$ of non-thermal pressure support in the outermost ICM regions, and that the convective transport itself is much less efficient than conduction at radially transporting energy. Finally, we show that the MTI saturation can be described by a diffusive mixing-length theory, shedding light on the diffusive buoyant nature of the instability.</description>

      <title>Detecting clusters and groups of galaxies populating the local Universe in large optical spectroscopic surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-field cosmological surveys provide hundreds of thousands of spectroscopically confirmed galaxy groups and clusters, valuable for tracing baryonic matter distribution. However, controlling systematics in identifying host dark matter halos and estimating their properties is crucial. We evaluate three group detection methods on a simulated dataset replicating the GAMA selection to understand systematics and selection effects. This is key for interpreting data from SDSS, GAMA, DESI, WAVES, and leveraging optical catalogues in the (X-ray) eROSITA era to quantify baryonic mass in galaxy groups. Using a lightcone from the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we simulate a spectroscopic galaxy survey in the local Universe (down to $z&lt;0.2$ and stellar mass completeness $M_{\star}\geq10^{9.8} M_{\odot}$). We assess completeness and contamination of reconstructed halo catalogues, evaluate membership accuracy, and analyse the halo mass recovery rate of group finders. All three group finders achieve high completeness ($&gt;80\%$) at group and cluster scales, confirming optical selection's suitability for dense regions. Contamination at low masses ($M_{200}&lt;10^{13} M_{\odot}$) arises from interlopers and fragmentation. Membership is at least 70\% accurate above the group mass scale, but inaccuracies bias halo mass estimates using galaxy velocity dispersion. Alternative proxies, like total stellar luminosity or mass, yield more accurate halo masses. The cumulative luminosity function of galaxy members matches predictions, showing the group finders' accuracy in identifying galaxy populations. These results confirm the reliability and completeness of spectroscopic catalogues produced by state-of-the-art group finders. This supports studies requiring large spectroscopic samples of galaxy groups and clusters, as well as investigations into galaxy evolution across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and GRB230307A, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Shock-associated Energetic Particle Intensities in the Inner Heliosphere: A Proof-of-Concept Capability for the PUNCH Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or shocks developed by corotating interaction regions (CIRs) often extend to high energies, and are thus key elements of space weather. The PUNCH mission, set to be launched in 2025, is equipped with photometric that enables 3D tracking of solar wind structures in the interplanetary space through polarized light. Tracking techniques are used to estimate speeds and speed gradients of solar structures, including speed jumps at fast shocks. We report on a strong and a robust relation between the shock speed jump magnitude at CME and CIR shocks and the peak fluxes of associated energetic particles from the analysis of 59 CME-driven shocks and 74 CIRs observed by Wind/STEP between 1997-2023. We demonstrate that this relation, along with PUNCH anticipated observations of solar structures can be used to forecast shock-associated particle events close to the Sun; thus, advancing and providing a crucial input to forecasting of SEP fluxes in the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>The perils of stacking optically selected groups in eROSITA data. The Magneticum perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.</description>

      <title>The hot gas mass fraction in halos. From Milky Way-like groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using eROSITA data in the eFEDS area, we provide a measure of the hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation over the largest halo mass range, from Milky Way-sized halos to massive clusters, and to the largest radii ever probed so far in local systems. To cope with the incompleteness and selection biases of the X-ray selection, we apply the stacking technique in eROSITA data of a highly complete and tested sample of optically selected groups. The method has been extensively tested on mock observations. In massive clusters, the hot gas alone provides a baryon budget within $R_{200}$ consistent with the cosmic value. At the same time, at the group mass scale, it accounts only for 20-40% of it. The hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation is well-fitted by a power law, with a consistent shape and a normalization varying at maximum by a factor of 2 from $r_{500}$ to $r_{200}$. Such a relation is consistent with other works in the literature that consider X-ray survey data at the same depth as eFEDS. However, it provides a lower average gas fraction in the group regime than works based on X-ray bright group samples. The comparison of the observed relation with the predictions of several hydrodynamical simulations (BAHAMAS, FLAMINGO, SIMBA, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, and Magneticum) shows that all simulations but Magneticum and SIMBA overpredict the gas fraction, with the largest discrepancy (up to a factor of 3) in the massive group-poor cluster halo mass range. We emphasize the need for mechanisms that can effectively expel gas to larger radii in galaxy groups without excessively quenching star formation in their member galaxies. Current hydrodynamical simulations face a significant challenge in balancing their subgrid physics: none can sufficiently evacuate gas from the halo virial region without negatively impacting the properties of the resident galaxy population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic, core-collapse simulations of sixteen progenitors following until 0.5 s after bounce. We use non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass between 9 and 24 $M_{\odot}$. The examined progenitors cover a wide range of the compactness parameter including a peak around $23 M_{\odot}$. We find that neutrino-driven explosions occur for all models within 0.3 s after bounce. We also find that the properties of the explosions and the central remnants are well correlated with the compactness. Early shock evolution is sensitive to the mass accretion rate onto the central core, reflecting the density profile of the progenitor stars. The most powerful explosions with diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp} \sim 0.75 \times 10^{51}$ erg are obtained by 23 and 24 $M_{\odot}$ models, which have the highest compactness among the examined models. These two models exhibit spiral SASI motions during 150-230 ms after bounce preceding a runaway shock expansion and leave a rapidly rotating neutron star with spin periods $\sim 50$ ms. Our models predict the gravitational masses of the neutron star ranging between $1.22 M_{\odot}$ and $1.67 M_{\odot}$ and their spin periods 0.04-4 s. The number distribution of these values roughly matches observation. On the other hand, our models predict small hydrodynamic kick velocity (15-260 km/s), although they are still growing at the end of our simulations. Further systematic studies, including rotation and binary effects, as well as long-term simulations up to several seconds, will enable us to explore the origin of various core-collapse supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Late-time non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic tidal ejecta of compact objects merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mergers of compact objects (binary neutron stars, BNS, or neutron star-black hole, NSBH) with a substantial mass ratio ($q&gt;1.5$) are expected to produce a mildly relativistic ejecta within $\sim20^\circ$ from the equatorial plane. We present a semi-analytic approach to calculate the expected synchrotron emission observed from various viewing angles, along with the corresponding radio maps, that are produced by a collisionless shock driven by such ejecta into the interstellar medium. This method reproduces well (up to $\sim30\%$ deviations) the observed emission produced by 2D numerical calculations of the full relativistic hydrodynamics. We consider a toroidal ejecta with an opening angle of $15^\circ\leq\theta_ \text{open}\leq30^\circ$ and broken power-law mass distribution, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_{\rm KN}$ at $\gamma\beta&lt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_{\rm ft}$ at $\gamma\beta&gt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). The parameter values are chosen to characterize merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, $1&lt;s_{\rm KN}&lt;3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at $\gamma\beta\approx 0.2$), and a steep, $s_{\rm ft}&gt;5$, "fast tail" mass distribution. While the peak flux is dimmer by a factor of $\sim$2-3, and the peak time remains roughly the same (within $20\%$), for various viewing angles compared to isotropic equivalent ejecta ($\theta_\text{open}=90^\circ$) considered in preceding papers, the radio maps are significantly different from the spherical case. The semi-analytic method can provide information on the ejecta geometry and viewing angle from future radio map observations and, consequently, constrain the ejection mechanism. For NSBH mergers with a significant mass ejection ($\sim0.1M_\odot$), this late non-thermal signal can be observed to distances of $\lesssim 200$Mpc for typical parameter values.</description>

      <title>Proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies in muon-depleted air showers with different depths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hardness of the energy spectrum of neutral pions produced in proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies, above $10^{18}$ eV, is constrained by the steepness of the shower-to-shower distribution of the number of muons in muon-depleted extensive air showers. In this work, we find that this steepness, quantified by the parameter $\Lambda_\mu$, evolves with the depth of the shower maximum, $X_{\max}$, assuming a universal value for shallow showers and an enhanced dependence on the high-energy hadronic interaction model for deep showers. We show that Xmax probes the so-called hadronic activity of the first interaction, thus allowing direct access to the energy spectrum of neutral pions in different regions of the kinematic phase space of the first interaction. We verify that the unbiased measurement of $\Lambda_\mu$ is possible for realistic mass composition expectations. Finally, we infer that the statistical precision in $\Lambda_\mu$ required to distinguish between hadronic interaction models can be achieved in current extensive air shower detectors, given their resolution and exposure.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency polarimetry of High-Synchrotron Peaked blazars probes the shape of their jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multifrequency polarimetry is emerging as a powerful probe of blazar jets, especially due to the advent of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) space observatory. We study the polarization of High-Synchrotron Peaked (HSP) blazars, where both optical and X-ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation from a population of non-thermal electrons. We adopt an axisymmetric stationary force-free jet model, where the electromagnetic fields are determined by the jet shape. When the jet is nearly parabolic, the X-ray polarization degree is $\Pi_{\rm X}\sim 15-50\%$, and the optical polarization degree is $\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 5-25\%$. The polarization degree is strongly chromatic, as $\Pi_{\rm X}/\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 2-9$. The chromaticity is due to the softening of the electron distribution at high energies, and is much stronger than for a uniform magnetic field. The Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) is aligned with the projection of the jet axis on the plane of the sky. These results compare very well with multifrequency polarimetric observations of HSP blazars. Instead, when the jet is nearly cylindrical, the polarization degree is large and weakly chromatic (we find $\Pi_{\rm X}\sim 70\%$ and $\Pi_{\rm O}\sim 60\%$, close to the expected values for a uniform magnetic field). The EVPA is perpendicular to the projection of the jet axis on the plane of the sky. Then, a cylindrical geometry is practically ruled out by current observations. The polarization degree and the EVPA may be less sensitive to the specific particle acceleration process (e.g.,~magnetic reconnection or shocks) than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Ejecta Width and Magnetization Reflected in Gamma-Ray Burst Early Afterglows: Implication for Reverse Shock Component and Shallow Decay Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the ejecta property dependence of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow, we carry out spherically symmetrical one-dimensional special relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of magnetized outflows with an adaptive mesh refinement method. The Lorentz factor evolutions of forward and reverse shocks induced by the interaction between magnetized ejecta and an ambient medium are investigated for a wide range of magnetization and width of the ejecta. The forward shock evolution is described by the magnetic acceleration, coasting, transition, and self-similar deceleration phases. According to our simulation results, we numerically calculate the corresponding radiation. Based on our numerical results, to model afterglow light curves in general cases, we construct semi-analytical formulae for the Lorentz factor evolutions. The magnetization and ejecta width dependence are clearly seen in the reverse shock light curves. The transition phase with a reasonable ejecta width can reproduce the shallow decay phase in the observed GRB afterglow. The inverse Compton emission in the magnetic acceleration phase can be responsible for the very steep rise of the early TeV emission in GRB221009A.</description>

Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Uniform Modeling of Observed Kilonovae: Implications for Diversity and the Progenitors of Merger-Driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present uniform modeling of eight kilonovae, five following short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; including GRB170817A) and three following long GRBs. We model their broadband afterglows to determine the relative contributions of afterglow and kilonova emission. We fit the kilonovae using a three-component model in MOSFiT that accounts for ejecta geometry, and find population median ejecta masses for the total, blue ($\kappa_{B} = 0.5$ cm^2 / g), purple ($\kappa_{P} = 3$ cm^2 / g), and red ($\kappa_{R} = 10$ cm^2 / g) components of $M_{ej, tot} = 0.085_{-0.040}^{+0.110} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, B} = 0.006_{-0.004}^{+0.015} M_{\odot}$, $M_{ej, P} = 0.020_{-0.010}^{+0.034} M_{\odot}$, and $M_{ej, R} = 0.051_{-0.045}^{+0.100} M_{\odot}$ (68% confidence). The kilonova of GW170817 is near the median of the sample in most derived properties, while the sample indicates great diversity. We investigate trends between the ejecta masses and the isotropic-equivalent and beaming-corrected gamma-ray energies ($E_{\gamma, iso}$, $E_{\gamma}$), as well as rest-frame durations ($T_{90, rest}$). We find long GRB kilonovae have higher median red ejecta masses ($M_{ej, R} &gt; 0.05 M_{\odot}$) compared to on-axis short GRB kilonovae ($M_{ej, R} &lt; 0.02 M_{\odot}$). We also observe a weak scaling between the total and red ejecta masses with $E_{\gamma, iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$, though a larger sample is needed to establish a significant correlation. These findings imply a connection between merger-driven long GRBs and larger tidal dynamical ejecta masses, which may indicate that their progenitors are asymmetric compact object binaries. We produce representative kilonova light curves and find that the planned depths and cadences of the Rubin and Roman Observatory surveys will be sufficient for order-of-magnitude constraints on $M_{ej, B}$ (and, for Roman, $M_{ej, P}$ and $M_{ej, R}$) of future kilonovae at $z &lt; 0.1$.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>

      <title>Neutrino constraints and detection prospects from gamma-ray bursts with different jet compositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prompt emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a long-standing open question, and GRBs have been considered as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. Despite many years of search for the neutrino events associated with GRBs from IceCube, there were no results. However, the absence of search results for neutrinos provides a unique opportunity to constrain the parameter space of GRB jet models. In this paper, we chose four peculiar GRBs with two different types of jet composition to investigate neutrino emission. It is found that only GRB 211211A could be well constrained within the dissipative photosphere model. By adopting the specific parameters of the photosphere, one can obtain $\varepsilon _{\rm p}/\varepsilon_{\rm e}&lt;8$ for $f_{\rm p}&gt;0.2$ from GRB 211211A. For the Internal-collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model, we can effectively constrain neither GRB 230307A nor GRB 080916C. Moreover, we also investigate the detection prospects of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs and find that it is difficult to detect at least one high-energy neutrino associated with GRBs from the ICMART model even during the IceCube-Gen2 operation. For the GRB 211211A-like events, it is possible to detect at least one neutrino coincident with the gravitational wave during the IceCube-Gen2 operation, if such an event originated from mergers of compact stars within the photosphere dissipation.</description>

      <title>Detection of the orbital modulation of Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission in Centaurus X-3 using the high-resolution spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line emission in X-ray spectra is a powerful diagnostic tool for various astrophysical objects to reveal the distribution of cold matter around photo-ionizing sources. The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the \textit{XRISM} satellite will bring new constraints on the emission line. We present one of the first such results for the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3, which is composed of an O-type star and a neutron star (NS). We conducted a 155 ks observation covering an entire binary orbit. A weak Fe K$\alpha$ line was detected in all orbital phases at an equivalent width (EW) of 10--20 eV. We found for the first time that its radial velocity (RV) is sinusoidally modulated by the orbital phase. The RV amplitude is 248 $\pm$ 13 km s$^{-1}$, which is significantly smaller than the value (391 km s$^{-1}$) expected if the emission is from the NS surface, but is consistent if the emission takes place at the O star surface. We discuss several possibilities of the line production site, including the NS surface, O star surface, O star wind, and accretion stream from the O star to the NS. We ran radiative transfer calculation for some of them assuming spherically-symmetric density and velocity profiles and an isotropic distribution of X-ray emission from the NS. None of them explains the observed EW and velocity dispersion dependence on the orbital phase, suggesting that more elaborated modeling is needed. In other words, the present observational results have capability to constrain deviations from these assumptions.</description>

      <title>GRB$\,$220831A: a hostless, intermediate Gamma-ray burst with an unusual optical afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB$\,$220831A is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration and spectral peak energy that places it at the interface between the distribution of long-soft and short-hard GRBs. In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to GRB$\,$220831A and its optical, near-infrared, X-ray and radio counterparts. Our deep optical and near-infrared observations do not reveal an underlying host galaxy, and establish that GRB$\,$220831A is observationally hostless to depth, $m_i\gtrsim26.6$ AB mag. Based on the Amati relation and the non-detection of an accompanying supernova, we find that this GRB is most likely to have originated from a collapsar at $z&gt;2$, but it could also possibly be a compact object merger at $z&lt;0.4$ with a large separation distance from its host galaxy. Regardless of its origin, we show that its optical and near-infrared counterpart departs from the evolution expected from a forward shock dominated synchrotron afterglow, exhibiting a steep post-break temporal powerlaw index of $-3.83^{+0.62}_{-0.79}$, too steep to be the jet-break. By analysing a range of models, we find that the observed steep departure from forward shock closure relations is likely due to an internal process producing either a flare or a plateau.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of strangeon matter using the measurements of PSR J0437-4715 and GW190814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Fermion Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>Updated Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Bounds on Long-lived Particles from Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As electromagnetic showers may alter the abundance of Helium, Lithium, and Deuterium, we can place severe constraints on the lifetime and amount of electromagnetic energy injected by long-lived particles. Considering up-to-date measurements of the light element abundances that point to $Y_p=0.245\pm 0.003$, $({\rm D/H})= (2.527\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-5}$, and the baryon-to-photon ratio obtained from the Cosmic Microwave Background data, $\eta=6.104 \times 10^{-10}$, we derive upper limits on the fraction of electromagnetic energy produced by long-lived particles. Our findings apply to decaying dark matter models, long-lived gravitinos, and other non-thermal processes that occurred in the early universe between $10^2-10^{10}$ seconds.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <title>A 2.9-hour periodic radio transient with an optical counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a long-period radio transient (GLEAM-X J0704-37) discovered to have an optical counterpart, consistent with a cool main sequence star of spectral type M3. The radio pulsations occur at the longest period yet found, 2.9 hours, and were discovered in archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). High time resolution observations from MeerKAT show that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high linear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due to strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more than a decade, show tentative evidence of a ~6-yr modulation. The high Galactic latitude of the system and the M-dwarf star excludes a magnetar interpretation, suggesting a more likely M-dwarf / white dwarf binary scenario for this system.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics around a black hole with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>
