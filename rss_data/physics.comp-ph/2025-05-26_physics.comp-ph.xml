      <title>A two-sided subgrid-scale model for mass transfer across fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of extremely thin concentration boundary layers at fluid interfaces for high local Peclet numbers is a severe obstacle for efficient and accurate numerical simulation of mass transfer processes in two-phase fluid systems. Especially challenging are liquid-liquid systems, in which thin concentration boundary layers can appear on both sides of the fluid interface under convection-dominated conditions. In those cases, the one-sided species concentrations at the interface are a-priori not even known approximately, but are determined by a conjugate mass transfer problem governed by interfacial jump conditions. We introduce a two-sided subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model for conjugate mass transfer at fluid interfaces that accurately computes the local mass transfer rates on moderate or coarse mesh resolutions even when very high concentration gradients in interface vicinity occur. For this purpose, SGS modeling is applied on both sides of an interface transmissive to passive scalars, such as the fluid interface, enabling the accurate capture of conjugate mass transfer across thin boundary layer on one or on both sides of the interface. We implement our approach in the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface-Tracking (ALE-IT) OpenFOAM module twoPhaseInterTrackFoam. We have made twoPhaseInterTrackFoam publicly available in our previous publication.</description>

      <title>Reference solutions for linear radiation transport: the Hohlraum and Lattice benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two benchmark problems for linear radiation transport and derived from the literature are presented in detail and several quantities of interest are defined. High-resolution simulations are computed using standard, robust numerical methods and implemented using HPC resources. The goal of these simulations is to provide reference solutions for new discretization approaches, to aid in the development of multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification and optimization algorithms, to provide data for training surrogates models. The code used to perform the simulations and post-process the data is publicly available, as is the raw data that used to generate the results presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Resistance of Magnetic Flux Concentrator during Generation of Strong Pulsed Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of significant increase of generated pulsed magnetic fields by the inductor system of a single-turn solenoid and magnetic flux concentrator without initialization of low-cycle fatigue mechanism is theoretically studied by varying the size of the inductor system, the material of the concentrator and the parameters of the discharge circuit. The analysis is carried out on the basis of self-consistent solution of the equation, which describes dynamics of the discharge electric circuit, with equations describing spatial distributions of magnetic and temperature fields, mechanical stresses and deformations in the inductor and concentrator. It is shown that for traditionally used steel concentrators by varying the electrical resistance of the circuit it is possible to increase the amplitude of generated pulsed magnetic fields without the threat of concentrator destruction by about 25~\%, from 32 to 40~T.</description>

      <title>An approach to identify the most semantically informative deep representations of text and images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Primitive variable regularization to derive novel Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations are reduced-order models for free-surface flows that employ a vertical velocity expansion and derive additional so-called moment equations for the expansion coefficients. Among desirable analytical properties for such systems of equations are hyperbolicity, accuracy, correct momentum equation, and interpretable steady states. In this paper, we show analytically that existing models fail at different of these properties and we derive new models overcoming the disadvantages. This is made possible by performing a hyperbolic regularization not in the convective variables (as done in the existing models) but in the primitive variables. Via analytical transformations between the convective and primitive system, we can prove hyperbolicity and compute analytical steady states of the new models. Simulating a dam-break test case, we demonstrate the accuracy of the new models and show that it is essential for accuracy to preserve the momentum equation.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Sharp Interface Immersed Boundary Solver for Large Scale Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) facilitate the simulation of flows around stationary, moving, and deforming bodies on Cartesian grids. However, extending these simulations to the large grid sizes required for realistic flow problems remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present the implementation and acceleration of \emph{ViCar3D}, a sharp-interface immersed boundary solver, on graphical processing units (GPUs). Using OpenACC, CUDA, and CUDA-aware MPI, we port and optimize \emph{ViCar3D} to multi-GPU architectures. Verification and scalability studies are performed for two benchmark cases: two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow past a finite rectangular wing. For the latter, we observe an approximately 20$\times$ speedup (node-to-node comparison) relative to the CPU-based implementation. The GPU-accelerated solver is capable of simulating complex 3D flows with up to 200 million mesh points on a single node equipped with four GPUs, and strong and weak scaling tests demonstrate maximum scaling efficiencies of 92\% and 93\%, respectively, on multi-GPU systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale Modeling of Polymer Topology Impact on Extrudability through Molecular Dynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how polymer topology influences melt extrudability is critical for advancing material design in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. In this work, we develop a bottom-up, cross-scale modeling framework that integrates coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and continuum-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to quantitatively assess the effects of polymer architecture on extrudability A range of branched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers are systematically designed by varying backbone length, sidechain length, grafting density, grafted block ratio, and periodicity of grafted-ungrafted segments. CGMD simulations are used to compute zero-shear viscosity and relaxation times, which are then incorporated into the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) model within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict pressure drop of PDMS during extrusion through printer nozzle. Qualitative analysis reveals that polymers with concentrated grafted blocks exhibit significantly higher zero-shear viscosity than stochastically branched analogs, while sidechain inertia drives longer relaxation time. However, for untangled and weakly entangled PDMS, relaxation time remains in the nanosecond range, making shear-thinning and elastic effects negligible. Consequently, zero-shear viscosity emerges as the primary determinant of extrudability. This cross-scale modeling strategy provides a predictive framework for guiding the rational design of extrudable polymer materials with tailored topologies.</description>

      <title>A tensor network approach for chaotic time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation With An Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geoscientific applications of ensemble Kalman filters face several computational challenges arising from the high dimensionality of the forecast covariance matrix, particularly when this matrix incorporates localization. For square-root filters, updating the perturbations of the ensemble members from their mean is an especially challenging step, one which generally requires approximations that introduce a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. This paper describes an ensemble square-root filter which achieves a favorable trade-off between these factors by discretizing an integral representation of the Kalman filter update equations, and in doing so, avoids a direct evaluation of the matrix square-root in the perturbation update stage. This algorithm, which we call InFo-ESRF ("Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter"), is parallelizable and uses a preconditioned Krylov method to update perturbations to a high degree of accuracy. Through numerical experiments with both a Gaussian forecast model and a multi-layer Lorenz-type system, we demonstrate that InFo-ESRF is competitive or superior to several existing localized square-root filters in terms of accuracy and cost.</description>

Abstract: We design a variational quantum algorithm to solve multi-dimensional Poisson equations with mixed boundary conditions that are typically required in various fields of computational science. Employing an objective function that is formulated with the concept of the minimal potential energy, we not only present in-depth discussion on the cost-efficient &amp; noise-robust design of quantum circuits that are essential for evaluation of the objective function, but, more remarkably, employ the proposed algorithm to calculate bias-dependent spatial distributions of electric fields in semiconductor systems that are described with a two-dimensional domain and up to 10-qubit circuits. Extending the application scope to multi-dimensional problems with mixed boundary conditions for the first time, fairly solid computational results of this work clearly demonstrate the potential of variational quantum algorithms to tackle Poisson equations derived from physically meaningful problems.</description>

      <title>Inverse-design topology optimization of magnonic devices using level-set method</title>

Abstract: The inverse design approach in magnonics exploits the wave nature of magnons and machine learning to develop logical devices with functionalities that exceed the capabilities of analytical methods. While promising for analog, Boolean, and neuromorphic computing, current implementations face memory limitations that hinder the design of complex systems. This study presents a level-set parameterization method for topology optimization, combined with an adjoint-state approach for memory-efficient simulation of magnetization dynamics. The framework is implemented in NeuralMag, a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic solver featuring a nodal finite-difference scheme and automatic differentiation tools. To validate the method, we optimized the shape of a magnetic nanoparticle by applying constraints to the objective function, and designed a 300-nm-wide yttrium iron garnet demultiplexer achieving frequency-selective spin-wave separation. These results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in exploring local minima across various initial configurations, establishing its utility as a versatile tool for the inverse design of magnonic logic devices.</description>

      <title>Investigation of coalescence and pinch-off processes of a self-rewetting drop interacting with a liquid layer</title>

Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs), such as long-chain aqueous alcohols, are a special class of liquids with surface tension that is anomalously dependent quadratically on temperature, resulting in thermocapillary flows that differ significantly from those in normal fluids (NFs). This study focuses on investigating the behavior of SRF drops interacting with a liquid layer under nonuniform heating conditions. In this regard, we employ a robust central moment-based lattice Boltzmann method with a phase-field model expressed in an axisymmetric formulation to capture three-dimensional effects efficiently. We investigate the coalescence and pinch-off processes in SRFs and compare them to those in NFs. Our simulations reveal that SRFs undergo pinch-off earlier than NFs. We also observe that increasing the Ohnesorge number Oh suppresses the pinch-off process, highlighting the relative role of viscous forces, which is modulated by gravity effects or the Bond number Bo. Furthermore, we explore how varying the dimensionless linear and quadratic sensitivity coefficients of surface tension on temperature, M1 and M2, respectively, and the dimensionless heat flux Q influence the coalescence/pinch-off behavior. Interestingly, contrary to the behavior in NFs, in SRFs increasing M2, or Q reduces the time required to pinch-off and widens the region in the Oh-Bo regime map where pinch-off occurs, when compared to the unheated cases. These differences are shown to be due to the variations in the thermocapillary forces on the interface. Overall, we find that under nonuniform heating, the SRFs enhance the pinch-off process compared to NFs across a wider range of conditions.</description>
