      <title>On the topology and geometry of population-based SHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM), aims to leverage information across populations of structures in order to enhance diagnostics on those with sparse data. The discipline of transfer learning provides the mechanism for this capability. One recent paper in PBSHM proposed a geometrical view in which the structures were represented as graphs in a metric "base space" with their data captured in the "total space" of a vector bundle above the graph space. This view was more suggestive than mathematically rigorous, although it did allow certain useful arguments. One bar to more rigorous analysis was the absence of a meaningful topology on the graph space, and thus no useful notion of continuity. The current paper aims to address this problem, by moving to parametric families of structures in the base space, essentially changing points in the graph space to open balls. This allows the definition of open sets in the fibre space and thus allows continuous variation between fibres. The new ideas motivate a new geometrical mechanism for transfer learning in data are transported from one fibre to an adjacent one; i.e., from one structure to another.</description>

      <title>StreamEnsemble: Predictive Queries over Spatiotemporal Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive queries over spatiotemporal (ST) stream data pose significant data processing and analysis challenges. ST data streams involve a set of time series whose data distributions may vary in space and time, exhibiting multiple distinct patterns. In this context, assuming a single machine learning model would adequately handle such variations is likely to lead to failure. To address this challenge, we propose StreamEnsemble, a novel approach to predictive queries over ST data that dynamically selects and allocates Machine Learning models according to the underlying time series distributions and model characteristics. Our experimental evaluation reveals that this method markedly outperforms traditional ensemble methods and single model approaches in terms of accuracy and time, demonstrating a significant reduction in prediction error of more than 10 times compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>AR-Sieve Bootstrap for the Random Forest and a simulation-based comparison with rangerts time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Forest (RF) algorithm can be applied to a broad spectrum of problems, including time series prediction. However, neither the classical IID (Independent and Identically distributed) bootstrap nor block bootstrapping strategies (as implemented in rangerts) completely account for the nature of the Data Generating Process (DGP) while resampling the observations. We propose the combination of RF with a residual bootstrapping technique where we replace the IID bootstrap with the AR-Sieve Bootstrap (ARSB), which assumes the DGP to be an autoregressive process. To assess the new model's predictive performance, we conduct a simulation study using synthetic data generated from different types of DGPs. It turns out that ARSB provides more variation amongst the trees in the forest. Moreover, RF with ARSB shows greater accuracy compared to RF with other bootstrap strategies. However, these improvements are achieved at some efficiency costs.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications involve reasoning about time durations before a critical event happens--also called time-to-event outcomes. When will a customer cancel a subscription, a coma patient wake up, or a convicted criminal reoffend? Time-to-event outcomes have been studied extensively within the field of survival analysis primarily by the statistical, medical, and reliability engineering communities, with textbooks already available in the 1970s and '80s. This monograph aims to provide a reasonably self-contained modern introduction to survival analysis. We focus on predicting time-to-event outcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks. Our goal is to provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely what the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from standard regression and classification, and how key "design patterns" have been used time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models, from classical methods like the Cox proportional hazards model to modern deep learning approaches such as deep kernel Kaplan-Meier estimators and neural ordinary differential equation models. We further delve into two extensions of the basic time-to-event prediction setup: predicting which of several critical events will happen first along with the time until this earliest event happens (the competing risks setting), and predicting time-to-event outcomes given a time series that grows in length over time (the dynamic setting). We conclude with a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning, interpretability, and statistical guarantees. Our monograph comes with an accompanying code repository that implements every model and evaluation metric that we cover in detail.</description>

      <title>Equivariant score-based generative models provably learn distributions with symmetries efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is ubiquitous in many real-world phenomena and tasks, such as physics, images, and molecular simulations. Empirical studies have demonstrated that incorporating symmetries into generative models can provide better generalization and sampling efficiency when the underlying data distribution has group symmetry. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis and guarantees of score-based generative models (SGMs) for learning distributions that are invariant with respect to some group symmetry and offer the first quantitative comparison between data augmentation and adding equivariant inductive bias. First, building on recent works on the Wasserstein-1 ($\mathbf{d}_1$) guarantees of SGMs and empirical estimations of probability divergences under group symmetry, we provide an improved $\mathbf{d}_1$ generalization bound when the data distribution is group-invariant. Second, we describe the inductive bias of equivariant SGMs using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theory, and rigorously demonstrate that one can learn the score of a symmetrized distribution using equivariant vector fields without data augmentations through the analysis of the optimality and equivalence of score-matching objectives. This also provides practical guidance that one does not have to augment the dataset as long as the vector field or the neural network parametrization is equivariant. Moreover, we quantify the impact of not incorporating equivariant structure into the score parametrization, by showing that non-equivariant vector fields can yield worse generalization bounds. This can be viewed as a type of model-form error that describes the missing structure of non-equivariant vector fields. Numerical simulations corroborate our analysis and highlight that data augmentations cannot replace the role of equivariant vector fields.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Optimism and Model Complexity in the Wake of Overparameterized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common practice in modern machine learning involves fitting a large number of parameters relative to the number of observations. These overparameterized models can exhibit surprising generalization behavior, e.g., ``double descent'' in the prediction error curve when plotted against the raw number of model parameters, or another simplistic notion of complexity. In this paper, we revisit model complexity from first principles, by first reinterpreting and then extending the classical statistical concept of (effective) degrees of freedom. Whereas the classical definition is connected to fixed-X prediction error (in which prediction error is defined by averaging over the same, nonrandom covariate points as those used during training), our extension of degrees of freedom is connected to random-X prediction error (in which prediction error is averaged over a new, random sample from the covariate distribution). The random-X setting more naturally embodies modern machine learning problems, where highly complex models, even those complex enough to interpolate the training data, can still lead to desirable generalization performance under appropriate conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed complexity measures through a mix of conceptual arguments, theory, and experiments, and illustrate how they can be used to interpret and compare arbitrary prediction models.</description>

      <title>Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>Deep Kernel Posterior Learning under Infinite Variance Prior Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neal (1996) proved that infinitely wide shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNN) converge to Gaussian processes (GP), when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Cho &amp; Saul (2009) provided a useful recursive formula for deep kernel processes for relating the covariance kernel of each layer to the layer immediately below. Moreover, they worked out the form of the layer-wise covariance kernel in an explicit manner for several common activation functions. Recent works, including Aitchison et al. (2021), have highlighted that the covariance kernels obtained in this manner are deterministic and hence, precludes any possibility of representation learning, which amounts to learning a non-degenerate posterior of a random kernel given the data. To address this, they propose adding artificial noise to the kernel to retain stochasticity, and develop deep kernel inverse Wishart processes. Nonetheless, this artificial noise injection could be critiqued in that it would not naturally emerge in a classic BNN architecture under an infinite-width limit. To address this, we show that a Bayesian deep neural network, where each layer width approaches infinity, and all network weights are elliptically distributed with infinite variance, converges to a process with $\alpha$-stable marginals in each layer that has a conditionally Gaussian representation. These conditional random covariance kernels could be recursively linked in the manner of Cho &amp; Saul (2009), even though marginally the process exhibits stable behavior, and hence covariances are not even necessarily defined. We also provide useful generalizations of the recent results of Lor\'ia &amp; Bhadra (2024) on shallow networks to multi-layer networks, and remedy the computational burden of their approach. The computational and statistical benefits over competing approaches stand out in simulations and in demonstrations on benchmark data sets.</description>

      <title>Introducing Flexible Monotone Multiple Choice Item Response Theory Models and Bit Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) is a powerful statistical approach for evaluating test items and determining test taker abilities through response analysis. An IRT model that better fits the data leads to more accurate latent trait estimates. In this study, we present a new model for multiple choice data, the monotone multiple choice (MMC) model, which we fit using autoencoders. Using both simulated scenarios and real data from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test, we demonstrate empirically that the MMC model outperforms the traditional nominal response IRT model in terms of fit. Furthermore, we illustrate how the latent trait scale from any fitted IRT model can be transformed into a ratio scale, aiding in score interpretation and making it easier to compare different types of IRT models. We refer to these new scales as bit scales. Bit scales are especially useful for models for which minimal or no assumptions are made for the latent trait scale distributions, such as for the autoencoder fitted models in this study.</description>

      <title>One Wave to Explain Them All: A Unifying Perspective on Post-hoc Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing use of deep neural networks in safety-critical decision-making, their inherent black-box nature hinders transparency and interpretability. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have thus emerged to understand a model's internal workings, and notably attribution methods also called saliency maps. Conventional attribution methods typically identify the locations -- the where -- of significant regions within an input. However, because they overlook the inherent structure of the input data, these methods often fail to interpret what these regions represent in terms of structural components (e.g., textures in images or transients in sounds). Furthermore, existing methods are usually tailored to a single data modality, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we propose leveraging the wavelet domain as a robust mathematical foundation for attribution. Our approach, the Wavelet Attribution Method (WAM) extends the existing gradient-based feature attributions into the wavelet domain, providing a unified framework for explaining classifiers across images, audio, and 3D shapes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that WAM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across faithfulness metrics and models in image, audio, and 3D explainability. Finally, we show how our method explains not only the where -- the important parts of the input -- but also the what -- the relevant patterns in terms of structural components.</description>

      <title>Attention layers provably solve single-location regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based models, such as Transformer, excel across various tasks but lack a comprehensive theoretical understanding, especially regarding token-wise sparsity and internal linear representations. To address this gap, we introduce the single-location regression task, where only one token in a sequence determines the output, and its position is a latent random variable, retrievable via a linear projection of the input. To solve this task, we propose a dedicated predictor, which turns out to be a simplified version of a non-linear self-attention layer. We study its theoretical properties, by showing its asymptotic Bayes optimality and analyzing its training dynamics. In particular, despite the non-convex nature of the problem, the predictor effectively learns the underlying structure. This work highlights the capacity of attention mechanisms to handle sparse token information and internal linear structures.</description>

      <title>Interval Estimation of Coefficients in Penalized Regression Models of Insurance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tweedie exponential dispersion family is a popular choice among many to model insurance losses that consist of zero-inflated semicontinuous data. In such data, it is often important to obtain credibility (inference) of the most important features that describe the endogenous variables. Post-selection inference is the standard procedure in statistics to obtain confidence intervals of model parameters after performing a feature extraction procedure. For a linear model, the lasso estimate often has non-negligible estimation bias for large coefficients corresponding to exogenous variables. To have valid inference on those coefficients, it is necessary to correct the bias of the lasso estimate. Traditional statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing or standard confidence interval construction might lead to incorrect conclusions during post-selection, as they are generally too optimistic. Here we discuss a few methodologies for constructing confidence intervals of the coefficients after feature selection in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family with application to insurance data.</description>

      <title>Spherical Analysis of Learning Nonlinear Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of functional neural networks. They have been proposed and studied with the aim of approximating continuous functionals defined on sets of functions on Euclidean domains. In this paper, we consider functionals defined on sets of functions on spheres. The approximation ability of deep ReLU neural networks is investigated by novel spherical analysis using an encoder-decoder framework. An encoder comes up first to accommodate the infinite-dimensional nature of the domain of functionals. It utilizes spherical harmonics to help us extract the latent finite-dimensional information of functions, which in turn facilitates in the next step of approximation analysis using fully connected neural networks. Moreover, real-world objects are frequently sampled discretely and are often corrupted by noise. Therefore, encoders with discrete input and those with discrete and random noise input are constructed, respectively. The approximation rates with different encoder structures are provided therein.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional logistic regression with missing data: Imputation, regularization, and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional, ridge-regularized logistic regression in a setting in which the covariates may be missing or corrupted by additive noise. When both the covariates and the additive corruptions are independent and normally distributed, we provide exact characterizations of both the prediction error as well as the estimation error. Moreover, we show that these characterizations are universal: as long as the entries of the data matrix satisfy a set of independence and moment conditions, our guarantees continue to hold. Universality, in turn, enables the detailed study of several imputation-based strategies when the covariates are missing completely at random. We ground our study by comparing the performance of these strategies with the conjectured performance -- stemming from replica theory in statistical physics -- of the Bayes optimal procedure. Our analysis yields several insights including: (i) a distinction between single imputation and a simple variant of multiple imputation and (ii) that adding a simple ridge regularization term to single-imputed logistic regression can yield an estimator whose prediction error is nearly indistinguishable from the Bayes optimal prediction error. We supplement our findings with extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Embedding-based statistical inference on generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent cohort of publicly available generative models can produce human expert level content across a variety of topics and domains. Given a model in this cohort as a base model, methods such as parameter efficient fine-tuning, in-context learning, and constrained decoding have further increased generative capabilities and improved both computational and data efficiency. Entire collections of derivative models have emerged as a byproduct of these methods and each of these models has a set of associated covariates such as a score on a benchmark, an indicator for if the model has (or had) access to sensitive information, etc. that may or may not be available to the user. For some model-level covariates, it is possible to use "similar" models to predict an unknown covariate. In this paper we extend recent results related to embedding-based representations of generative models -- the data kernel perspective space -- to classical statistical inference settings. We demonstrate that using the perspective space as the basis of a notion of "similar" is effective for multiple model-level inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Almost Free: Self-concordance in Natural Exponential Families and an Application to Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that single-parameter natural exponential families with subexponential tails are self-concordant with polynomial-sized parameters. For subgaussian natural exponential families we establish an exact characterization of the growth rate of the self-concordance parameter. Applying these findings to bandits allows us to fill gaps in the literature: We show that optimistic algorithms for generalized linear bandits enjoy regret bounds that are both second-order (scale with the variance of the optimal arm's reward distribution) and free of an exponential dependence on the bound of the problem parameter in the leading term. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first regret bound for generalized linear bandits with subexponential tails, broadening the class of problems to include Poisson, exponential and gamma bandits.</description>

      <title>Efficient PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Constant Malicious Noise Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding noise tolerance of learning algorithms under certain conditions is a central quest in learning theory. In this work, we study the problem of computationally efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in the presence of malicious noise, where an adversary can corrupt both instances and labels of training samples. The best-known noise tolerance either depends on a target error rate under distributional assumptions or on a margin parameter under large-margin conditions. In this work, we show that when both types of conditions are satisfied, it is possible to achieve {\em constant} noise tolerance by minimizing a reweighted hinge loss. Our key ingredients include: 1) an efficient algorithm that finds weights to control the gradient deterioration from corrupted samples, and 2) a new analysis on the robustness of the hinge loss equipped with such weights.</description>

      <title>Diverse Expected Improvement (DEI): Diverse Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Computer Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box simulators arises in a myriad of modern scientific and engineering applications. Bayesian optimization provides an appealing solution, by leveraging a fitted surrogate model to guide the selection of subsequent simulator evaluations. In practice, however, the objective is often not to obtain a single good solution, but rather a ''basket'' of good solutions from which users can choose for downstream decision-making. This need arises in our motivating application for real-time control of internal combustion engines for flight propulsion, where a diverse set of control strategies is essential for stable flight control. There has been little work on this front for Bayesian optimization. We thus propose a new Diverse Expected Improvement (DEI) method that searches for diverse ''$\epsilon$-optimal'' solutions: locally-optimal solutions within a tolerance level $\epsilon &gt; 0$ from a global optimum. We show that DEI yields a closed-form acquisition function under a Gaussian process surrogate model, which facilitates efficient sequential queries via automatic differentiation. This closed form further reveals a novel exploration-exploitation-diversity trade-off, which incorporates the desired diversity property within the well-known exploration-exploitation trade-off. We demonstrate the improvement of DEI over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments, then explore the DEI in two applications on rover trajectory optimization and engine control for flight propulsion.</description>

      <title>Induced Covariance for Causal Discovery in Linear Sparse Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal models seek to unravel the cause-effect relationships among variables from observed data, as opposed to mere mappings among them, as traditional regression models do. This paper introduces a novel causal discovery algorithm designed for settings in which variables exhibit linearly sparse relationships. In such scenarios, the causal links represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be encapsulated in a structural matrix. The proposed approach leverages the structural matrix's ability to reconstruct data and the statistical properties it imposes on the data to identify the correct structural matrix. This method does not rely on independence tests or graph fitting procedures, making it suitable for scenarios with limited training data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the well-known PC, GES, BIC exact search, and LINGAM-based methods in recovering linearly sparse causal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of POMDPs with Known Observation Model in Average-Reward Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dealing with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes is notably a challenging task. We face an average-reward infinite-horizon POMDP setting with an unknown transition model, where we assume the knowledge of the observation model. Under this assumption, we propose the Observation-Aware Spectral (OAS) estimation technique, which enables the POMDP parameters to be learned from samples collected using a belief-based policy. Then, we propose the OAS-UCRL algorithm that implicitly balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off following the $\textit{optimism in the face of uncertainty}$ principle. The algorithm runs through episodes of increasing length. For each episode, the optimal belief-based policy of the estimated POMDP interacts with the environment and collects samples that will be used in the next episode by the OAS estimation procedure to compute a new estimate of the POMDP parameters. Given the estimated model, an optimization oracle computes the new optimal policy. We show the consistency of the OAS procedure, and we prove a regret guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log(T)})$ for the proposed OAS-UCRL algorithm. We compare against the oracle playing the optimal stochastic belief-based policy and show the efficient scaling of our approach with respect to the dimensionality of the state, action, and observation space. We finally conduct numerical simulations to validate and compare the proposed technique with other baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Newton Meets Marchenko-Pastur: Massively Parallel Second-Order Optimization with Hessian Sketching and Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in serverless cloud computing, in particular the "function as a service" (FaaS) model, we consider the problem of minimizing a convex function in a massively parallel fashion, where communication between workers is limited. Focusing on the case of a twice-differentiable objective subject to an L2 penalty, we propose a scheme where the central node (server) effectively runs a Newton method, offloading its high per-iteration cost -- stemming from the need to invert the Hessian -- to the workers. In our solution, workers produce independently coarse but low-bias estimates of the inverse Hessian, using an adaptive sketching scheme. The server then averages the descent directions produced by the workers, yielding a good approximation for the exact Newton step. The main component of our adaptive sketching scheme is a low-complexity procedure for selecting the sketching dimension, an issue that was left largely unaddressed in the existing literature on Hessian sketching for distributed optimization. Our solution is based on ideas from asymptotic random matrix theory, specifically the Marchenko-Pastur law. For Gaussian sketching matrices, we derive non asymptotic guarantees for our algorithm which are essentially dimension-free. Lastly, when the objective is self-concordant, we provide convergence guarantees for the approximate Newton's method with noisy Hessians, which may be of independent interest beyond the setting considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Overpredictive Signal Analytics in Federated Learning: Algorithms and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge signal processing facilitates distributed learning and inference in the client-server model proposed in federated learning. In traditional machine learning, clients (IoT devices) that acquire raw signal samples can aid a data center (server) learn a global signal model by pooling these distributed samples at a third-party location. Despite the promising capabilities of IoTs, these distributed deployments often face the challenge of sensitive private data and communication rate constraints. This necessitates a learning approach that communicates a processed approximation of the distributed samples instead of the raw signals. Such a decentralized learning approach using signal approximations will be termed distributed signal analytics in this work. Overpredictive signal approximations may be desired for distributed signal analytics, especially in network demand (capacity) planning applications motivated by federated learning. In this work, we propose algorithms that compute an overpredictive signal approximation at the client devices using an efficient convex optimization framework. Tradeoffs between communication cost, sampling rate, and the signal approximation error are quantified using mathematical analysis. We also show the performance of the proposed distributed algorithms on a publicly available residential energy consumption dataset.</description>

      <title>Adaptive teachers for amortized samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amortized inference is the task of training a parametric model, such as a neural network, to approximate a distribution with a given unnormalized density where exact sampling is intractable. When sampling is implemented as a sequential decision-making process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as generative flow networks, can be used to train the sampling policy. Off-policy RL training facilitates the discovery of diverse, high-reward candidates, but existing methods still face challenges in efficient exploration. We propose to use an adaptive training distribution (the Teacher) to guide the training of the primary amortized sampler (the Student) by prioritizing high-loss regions. The Teacher, an auxiliary behavior model, is trained to sample high-error regions of the Student and can generalize across unexplored modes, thereby enhancing mode coverage by providing an efficient training curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in a synthetic environment designed to present an exploration challenge, two diffusion-based sampling tasks, and four biochemical discovery tasks demonstrating its ability to improve sample efficiency and mode coverage.</description>

      <title>Reducing Variance in Meta-Learning via Laplace Approximation for Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of sample points, meta-learning algorithms aim to learn an optimal adaptation strategy for new, unseen tasks. Often, this data can be ambiguous as it might belong to different tasks concurrently. This is particularly the case in meta-regression tasks. In such cases, the estimated adaptation strategy is subject to high variance due to the limited amount of support data for each task, which often leads to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this work, we address the problem of variance reduction in gradient-based meta-learning and formalize the class of problems prone to this, a condition we refer to as \emph{task overlap}. Specifically, we propose a novel approach that reduces the variance of the gradient estimate by weighing each support point individually by the variance of its posterior over the parameters. To estimate the posterior, we utilize the Laplace approximation, which allows us to express the variance in terms of the curvature of the loss landscape of our meta-learner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and highlight the importance of variance reduction in meta-learning.</description>

      <title>Bayes' Power for Explaining In-Context Learning Generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, neural network training has been primarily viewed as an approximation of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This interpretation originated in a time when training for multiple epochs on small datasets was common and performance was data bound; but it falls short in the era of large-scale single-epoch trainings ushered in by large self-supervised setups, like language models. In this new setup, performance is compute-bound, but data is readily available. As models became more powerful, in-context learning (ICL), i.e., learning in a single forward-pass based on the context, emerged as one of the dominant paradigms. In this paper, we argue that a more useful interpretation of neural network behavior in this era is as an approximation of the true posterior, as defined by the data-generating process. We demonstrate this interpretations' power for ICL and its usefulness to predict generalizations to previously unseen tasks. We show how models become robust in-context learners by effectively composing knowledge from their training data. We illustrate this with experiments that reveal surprising generalizations, all explicable through the exact posterior. Finally, we show the inherent constraints of the generalization capabilities of posteriors and the limitations of neural networks in approximating these posteriors.</description>

      <title>On Using Certified Training towards Empirical Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is arguably the most popular way to provide empirical robustness against specific adversarial examples. While variants based on multi-step attacks incur significant computational overhead, single-step variants are vulnerable to a failure mode known as catastrophic overfitting, which hinders their practical utility for large perturbations. A parallel line of work, certified training, has focused on producing networks amenable to formal guarantees of robustness against any possible attack. However, the wide gap between the best-performing empirical and certified defenses has severely limited the applicability of the latter. Inspired by recent developments in certified training, which rely on a combination of adversarial attacks with network over-approximations, and by the connections between local linearity and catastrophic overfitting, we present experimental evidence on the practical utility and limitations of using certified training towards empirical robustness. We show that, when tuned for the purpose, a recent certified training algorithm can prevent catastrophic overfitting on single-step attacks, and that it can bridge the gap to multi-step baselines under appropriate experimental settings. Finally, we present a novel regularizer for network over-approximations that can achieve similar effects while markedly reducing runtime.</description>

      <title>Efficient Statistics With Unknown Truncation, Polynomial Time Algorithms, Beyond Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of distributional parameters when samples are shown only if they fall in some unknown set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. Kontonis, Tzamos, and Zampetakis (FOCS'19) gave a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-accurate parameters for the special case of Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrix. Recently, Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas, and Zarifis (COLT'24) showed that this exponential dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ is necessary even when $S$ belongs to some well-behaved classes. These works leave the following open problems which we address in this work: Can we estimate the parameters of any Gaussian or even extend beyond Gaussians? Can we design $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ time algorithms when $S$ is a simple set such as a halfspace?
  We make progress on both of these questions by providing the following results:
  1. Toward the first question, we give a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(\ell/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for any exponential family that satisfies some structural assumptions and any unknown set $S$ that is $\varepsilon$-approximable by degree-$\ell$ polynomials. This result has two important applications:
  1a) The first algorithm for estimating arbitrary Gaussian distributions from samples truncated to an unknown $S$; and
  1b) The first algorithm for linear regression with unknown truncation and Gaussian features.
  2. To address the second question, we provide an algorithm with runtime $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ that works for a set of exponential families (containing all Gaussians) when $S$ is a halfspace or an axis-aligned rectangle.
  Along the way, we develop tools that may be of independent interest, including, a reduction from PAC learning with positive and unlabeled samples to PAC learning with positive and negative samples that is robust to certain covariate shifts.</description>

      <title>Smaller Confidence Intervals From IPW Estimators via Data-Dependent Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimators are prevalent in causal inference for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies. Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\varepsilon&gt;0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1).
  We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants. Each CIPW estimator is an IPW estimator on a coarsened covariate space, where certain covariates are merged. Under mild assumptions, e.g., Lipschitzness in expected outcomes and sparsity of extreme propensity scores, we give an efficient algorithm to find a robust estimator: given $\varepsilon$-inaccurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, its confidence interval size scales with $\varepsilon+1/\sqrt{n}$. In contrast, under the same assumptions, existing estimators' confidence interval sizes are $\Omega(1)$ irrespective of $\varepsilon$ and $n$. Crucially, our estimator is data-dependent and we show that no data-independent CIPW estimator can be robust to inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Sparse Covariance Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of tabular data and achieve success in a variety of applications. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which the VNNs operate may contain many spurious correlations, making VNNs' performance inconsistent due to these noisy estimates and decreasing their computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix before convolution. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve covariance estimation and reduce computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. We show that S-VNNs are more stable than nominal VNNs as well as sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we provide novel connections between S-VNN stability and data distribution. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on various application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, stability, and computational efficiency of S-VNNs compared with nominal VNNs.</description>

      <title>Trained Transformer Classifiers Generalize and Exhibit Benign Overfitting In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training ("in-context") examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example. A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares. In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks. Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time. We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit "benign overfitting in-context": when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples.</description>

      <title>On metric choice in dimension reduction for Fr\'echet regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet regression is becoming a mainstay in modern data analysis for analyzing non-traditional data types belonging to general metric spaces. This novel regression method utilizes the pairwise distances between the random objects, which makes the choice of metric crucial in the estimation. In this paper, the effect of metric choice on the estimation of the dimension reduction subspace for the regression between random responses and Euclidean predictors is investigated. Extensive numerical studies illustrate how different metrics affect the central and central mean space estimates for regression involving responses belonging to some popular metric spaces versus Euclidean predictors. An analysis of the distributions of glycaemia based on continuous glucose monitoring data demonstrate how metric choice can influence findings in real applications.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bootstrap: New Privacy Analysis and Inference Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms protect individual-level information by introducing randomness into the statistical analysis procedure. Despite the availability of numerous DP tools, there remains a lack of general techniques for conducting statistical inference under DP. We examine a DP bootstrap procedure that releases multiple private bootstrap estimates to infer the sampling distribution and construct confidence intervals (CIs). Our privacy analysis presents new results on the privacy cost of a single DP bootstrap estimate, applicable to any DP mechanism, and identifies some misapplications of the bootstrap in the existing literature. For the composition of the DP bootstrap, we present a numerical method to compute the exact privacy cost of releasing multiple DP bootstrap estimates, and using the Gaussian-DP (GDP) framework (Dong et al., 2022), we show that the release of $B$ DP bootstrap estimates from mechanisms satisfying $(\mu/\sqrt{(2-2/\mathrm{e})B})$-GDP asymptotically satisfies $\mu$-GDP as $B$ goes to infinity. Then, we perform private statistical inference by post-processing the DP bootstrap estimates. We prove that our point estimates are consistent, our standard CIs are asymptotically valid, and both enjoy optimal convergence rates. To further improve the finite performance, we use deconvolution with DP bootstrap estimates to accurately infer the sampling distribution. We derive CIs for tasks such as population mean estimation, logistic regression, and quantile regression, and we compare them to existing methods using simulations and real-world experiments on 2016 Canada Census data. Our private CIs achieve the nominal coverage level and offer the first approach to private inference for quantile regression.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Divergence Loss Function for Neural Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique for capturing relationships between two probability distributions. State-of-the-art DRE methods estimate the density ratio using neural networks trained with loss functions derived from variational representations of $f$-divergence. However, existing methods face optimization challenges, such as overfitting due to lower-unbounded loss functions, biased mini-batch gradients, vanishing training loss gradients, and high sample requirements for Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss functions. To address these issues, we focus on $\alpha$-divergence, which provides a suitable variational representation of $f$-divergence. Subsequently, a novel loss function for DRE, the $\alpha$-divergence loss function ($\alpha$-Div), is derived. $\alpha$-Div is concise but offers stable and effective optimization for DRE. The boundedness of $\alpha$-divergence provides the potential for successful DRE with data exhibiting high KL-divergence. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in optimization using $\alpha$-Div. However, the experiments also show that the proposed loss function offers no significant advantage over the KL-divergence loss function in terms of RMSE for DRE. This indicates that the accuracy of DRE is primarily determined by the amount of KL-divergence in the data and is less dependent on $\alpha$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Sequential transport maps using SoS density estimation and $\alpha$-divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport-based density estimation methods are receiving growing interest because of their ability to efficiently generate samples from the approximated density. We further invertigate the sequential transport maps framework proposed from arXiv:2106.04170 arXiv:2303.02554, which builds on a sequence of composed Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) maps. Each of those maps are built by first estimating an intermediate density of moderate complexity, and then by computing the exact KR map from a reference density to the precomputed approximate density. In our work, we explore the use of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) densities and $\alpha$-divergences for approximating the intermediate densities. Combining SoS densities with $\alpha$-divergence interestingly yields convex optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. The main advantage of $\alpha$-divergences is to enable working with unnormalized densities, which provides benefits both numerically and theoretically. In particular, we provide a new convergence analyses of the sequential transport maps based on information geometric properties of $\alpha$-divergences. The choice of intermediate densities is also crucial for the efficiency of the method. While tempered (or annealed) densities are the state-of-the-art, we introduce diffusion-based intermediate densities which permits to approximate densities known from samples only. Such intermediate densities are well-established in machine learning for generative modeling. Finally we propose low-dimensional maps (or lazy maps) for dealing with high-dimensional problems and numerically demonstrate our methods on Bayesian inference problems and unsupervised learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic approach for generating prediction intervals in datasets with complete or missing data. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, leveraging latent variable modeling for uncertainty estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations across 11 tabular datasets show that SEMF often achieves narrower normalized prediction intervals and higher coverage rates than traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, SEMF can be integrated with machine learning models like gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, highlighting its practical applicability. The results indicate that SEMF enhances uncertainty quantification, particularly in scenarios with complete data.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of density regression through tree flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common objective in the analysis of tabular data is estimating the conditional distribution (in contrast to only producing predictions) of a set of "outcome" variables given a set of "covariates", which is sometimes referred to as the "density regression" problem. Beyond estimation on the conditional distribution, the generative ability of drawing synthetic samples from the learned conditional distribution is also desired as it further widens the range of applications. We propose a flow-based generative model tailored for the density regression task on tabular data. Our flow applies a sequence of tree-based piecewise-linear transforms on initial uniform noise to eventually generate samples from complex conditional densities of (univariate or multivariate) outcomes given the covariates and allows efficient analytical evaluation of the fitted conditional density on any point in the sample space. We introduce a training algorithm for fitting the tree-based transforms using a divide-and-conquer strategy that transforms maximum likelihood training of the tree-flow into training a collection of binary classifiers--one at each tree split--under cross-entropy loss. We assess the performance of our method under out-of-sample likelihood evaluation and compare it with a variety of state-of-the-art conditional density learners on a range of simulated and real benchmark tabular datasets. Our method consistently achieves comparable or superior performance at a fraction of the training and sampling budget. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method's generative ability through an application to generating synthetic longitudinal microbiome compositional data based on training our flow on a publicly available microbiome study.</description>

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for assessing a target policy's impact offline before its deployment. However, achieving accurate OPE in large state spaces remains challenging. This paper studies state abstractions -- originally designed for policy learning -- in the context of OPE. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We define a set of irrelevance conditions central to learning state abstractions for OPE, and derive a backward-model-irrelevance condition for achieving irrelevance in %sequential and (marginalized) importance sampling ratios by constructing a time-reversed Markov decision process (MDP). (ii) We propose a novel iterative procedure that sequentially projects the original state space into a smaller space, resulting in a deeply-abstracted state, which substantially simplifies the sample complexity of OPE arising from high cardinality. (iii) We prove the Fisher consistencies of various OPE estimators when applied to our proposed abstract state spaces.</description>

      <title>Predictive Low Rank Matrix Learning under Partial Observations: Mixed-Projection ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ($k \leq 15$), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average $79\%$ lower objective value and $90.1\%$ lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the best performing benchmark method on synthetic data. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute. On large scale real world data, our algorithm produces solutions that achieve $67\%$ lower out of sample error than benchmark methods in $97\%$ less execution time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) of large language models has proven to be a surprisingly effective method of learning a new task from only a few demonstrative examples. In this paper, we study the efficacy of ICL from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory. We develop approximation and generalization error bounds for a transformer composed of a deep neural network and one linear attention layer, pretrained on nonparametric regression tasks sampled from general function spaces including the Besov space and piecewise $\gamma$-smooth class. We show that sufficiently trained transformers can achieve -- and even improve upon -- the minimax optimal estimation risk in context by encoding the most relevant basis representations during pretraining. Our analysis extends to high-dimensional or sequential data and distinguishes the \emph{pretraining} and \emph{in-context} generalization gaps. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds for meta-learners w.r.t. both the number of tasks and in-context examples. These findings shed light on the roles of task diversity and representation learning for ICL.</description>

      <title>Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06342v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized matrix algorithms have become workhorse tools in scientific computing and machine learning. To use these algorithms safely in applications, they should be coupled with posterior error estimates to assess the quality of the output. To meet this need, this paper proposes two diagnostics: a leave-one-out error estimator for randomized low-rank approximations and a jackknife resampling method to estimate the variance of the output of a randomized matrix computation. Both of these diagnostics are rapid to compute for randomized low-rank approximation algorithms such as the randomized SVD and randomized Nystr\"om approximation, and they provide useful information that can be used to assess the quality of the computed output and guide algorithmic parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Importance is Important: Generalized Markov Chain Importance Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any multiple-try Metropolis algorithm, one can always accept the proposal and evaluate the importance weight that is needed to correct for the bias without extra computational cost. This results in a general, convenient, and rejection-free Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. By further leveraging the importance sampling perspective on Metropolis--Hastings algorithms, we propose an alternative MCMC sampler on discrete spaces that is also outside the Metropolis--Hastings framework, along with a general theory on its complexity. Numerical examples suggest that the proposed algorithms are consistently more efficient than the original Metropolis--Hastings versions.</description>

      <title>Minimax Signal Detection in Sparse Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse additive models are an attractive choice in circumstances calling for modelling flexibility in the face of high dimensionality. We study the signal detection problem and establish the minimax separation rate for the detection of a sparse additive signal. Our result is nonasymptotic and applicable to the general case where the univariate component functions belong to a generic reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike the estimation theory, the minimax separation rate reveals a nontrivial interaction between sparsity and the choice of function space. We also investigate adaptation to sparsity and establish an adaptive testing rate for a generic function space; adaptation is possible in some spaces while others impose an unavoidable cost. Finally, adaptation to both sparsity and smoothness is studied in the setting of Sobolev space, and we correct some existing claims in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fitting an ellipsoid to a quadratic number of random points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\mathrm{P})$ of fitting $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the boundary of a centered ellipsoid, as $n, d \to \infty$. This problem is conjectured to have a sharp feasibility transition: for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, if $n \leq (1 - \varepsilon) d^2 / 4$ then $(\mathrm{P})$ has a solution with high probability, while $(\mathrm{P})$ has no solutions with high probability if $n \geq (1 + \varepsilon) d^2 /4$. So far, only a trivial bound $n \geq d^2 / 2$ is known on the negative side, while the best results on the positive side assume $n \leq d^2 / \mathrm{polylog}(d)$. In this work, we improve over previous approaches using a key result of Bartl &amp; Mendelson (2022) on the concentration of Gram matrices of random vectors under mild assumptions on their tail behavior. This allows us to give a simple proof that $(\mathrm{P})$ is feasible with high probability when $n \leq d^2 / C$, for a (possibly large) constant $C &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Time-Uniform Confidence Spheres for Means of Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and study time-uniform confidence spheres -- confidence sphere sequences (CSSs) -- which contain the mean of random vectors with high probability simultaneously across all sample sizes. Our results include a dimension-free CSS for log-concave random vectors, a dimension-free CSS for sub-Gaussian random vectors, and CSSs for sub-$\psi$ random vectors (which includes sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and sub-exponential distributions). For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid. Our work is based on PAC-Bayesian theory and inspired by an approach of Catoni and Giulini.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <title>Broadening Target Distributions for Accelerated Diffusion Models via a Novel Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerated diffusion models hold the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of standard diffusion processes. Theoretically, these models have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates than the standard $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rate of vanilla diffusion models, where $\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy. However, current theoretical studies have established the acceleration advantage only for restrictive target distribution classes, such as those with smoothness conditions imposed along the entire sampling path or with bounded support. In this work, we significantly broaden the target distribution classes with a novel accelerated stochastic DDPM sampler. In particular, we show that it achieves accelerated performance for three broad distribution classes not considered before. Our first class relies on the smoothness condition posed only to the target density $q_0$, which is far more relaxed than the existing smoothness conditions posed to all $q_t$ along the entire sampling path. Our second class requires only a finite second moment condition, allowing for a much wider class of target distributions than the existing finite-support condition. Our third class is Gaussian mixture, for which our result establishes the first acceleration guarantee. Moreover, among accelerated DDPM type samplers, our results specialized for bounded-support distributions show an improved dependency on the data dimension $d$. Our analysis introduces a novel technique for establishing performance guarantees via constructing a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and utilizing Tweedie's formula to handle Taylor expansion terms. This new analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Observational Scaling Laws and the Predictability of Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~100 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</description>

      <title>Local convergence of simultaneous min-max algorithms to differential equilibrium on Riemannian manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study min-max algorithms to solve zero-sum differential games on Riemannian manifold. Based on the notions of differential Stackelberg equilibrium and differential Nash equilibrium on Riemannian manifold, we analyze the local convergence of two representative deterministic simultaneous algorithms $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA to such equilibrium. Sufficient conditions are obtained to establish their linear convergence rates by Ostrowski theorem on manifold and spectral analysis. The $\tau$-SGA algorithm is extended from the symplectic gradient-adjustment method in Euclidean space to avoid strong rotational dynamics in $\tau$-GDA. In some cases, we obtain a faster convergence rate of $\tau$-SGA through an asymptotic analysis which is valid when the learning rate ratio $\tau$ is big. We show numerically how the insights obtained from the convergence analysis may improve the training of orthogonal Wasserstein GANs using stochastic $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA on simple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HOPE for a Robust Parameterization of Long-memory State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, an SSM often needs a specifically designed initialization, and the training of state matrices is on a logarithmic scale with a very small learning rate. To understand these choices from a unified perspective, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory. Building upon it, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. Our approach helps improve the initialization and training stability, leading to a more robust parameterization. We efficiently implement these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and they require fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, our new parameterization endows the SSM with non-decaying memory within a fixed time window, which is empirically corroborated by a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise.</description>

      <title>Improving Fairness and Mitigating MADness in Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models unfairly penalize data belonging to minority classes, suffer from model autophagy disorder (MADness), and learn biased estimates of the underlying distribution parameters. Our theoretical and empirical results show that training generative models with intentionally designed hypernetworks leads to models that 1) are more fair when generating datapoints belonging to minority classes 2) are more stable in a self-consumed (i.e., MAD) setting, and 3) learn parameters that are less statistically biased. To further mitigate unfairness, MADness, and bias, we introduce a regularization term that penalizes discrepancies between a generative model's estimated weights when trained on real data versus its own synthetic data. To facilitate training existing deep generative models within our framework, we offer a scalable implementation of hypernetworks that automatically generates a hypernetwork architecture for any given generative model.</description>

      <title>MallowsPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization in Time-Varying Networks with Arbitrary Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem for networks affected by communication delays. Examples of such networks include collaborative machine learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent systems. To mimic communication delays, we add virtual non-computing nodes to the network, resulting in directed graphs. This motivates investigating decentralized optimization solutions on directed graphs. Existing solutions assume nodes know their out-degrees, resulting in limited applicability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel gossip-based algorithm, called DT-GO, that does not need to know the out-degrees. The algorithm is applicable in general directed networks, for example networks with delays or limited acknowledgment capabilities. We derive convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives, showing that our algorithm achieves the same complexity order as centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, the effects of the graph topology and delays are confined to higher-order terms. Additionally, we extend our analysis to accommodate time-varying network topologies. Numerical simulations are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Tackling GenAI Copyright Issues: Originality Estimation and Genericization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03341v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While various techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. As a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen, which combines our genericization method with an existing mitigation technique. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt, dramatically improving the performance. Additionally, while generative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the generation of such characters in these cases.</description>

      <title>Crafting Heavy-Tails in Weight Matrix Spectrum without Gradient Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training strategies for modern deep neural networks (NNs) tend to induce a heavy-tailed (HT) empirical spectral density (ESD) in the layer weights. While previous efforts have shown that the HT phenomenon correlates with good generalization in large NNs, a theoretical explanation of its occurrence is still lacking. Especially, understanding the conditions which lead to this phenomenon can shed light on the interplay between generalization and weight spectra. Our work aims to bridge this gap by presenting a simple, rich setting to model the emergence of HT ESD. In particular, we present a theory-informed analysis for 'crafting' heavy tails in the ESD of two-layer NNs without any gradient noise. This is the first work to analyze a noise-free setting and incorporate optimizer (GD/Adam) dependent (large) learning rates into the HT ESD analysis. Our results highlight the role of learning rates on the Bulk+Spike and HT shape of the ESDs in the early phase of training, which can facilitate generalization in the two-layer NN. These observations shed light on the behavior of large-scale NNs, albeit in a much simpler setting. Last but not least, we present a novel perspective on the ESD evolution dynamics by analyzing the singular vectors of weight matrices and optimizer updates.</description>

      <title>Temporal Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</description>

      <title>Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&amp;P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In graph learning the graph and the node features both contain noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to jointly rewire the graph and denoise the features, which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR improves the alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To approximately solve the associated non-convex optimization problem we propose a heuristic that efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and verify the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets. The results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on node classification using GNNs as downstream models.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Optimal Stopping: A Singular Control Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores continuous-time and state-space optimal stopping problems from a reinforcement learning perspective. We begin by formulating the stopping problem using randomized stopping times, where the decision maker's control is represented by the probability of stopping within a given time--specifically, a bounded, non-decreasing, c\`adl\`ag control process. To encourage exploration and facilitate learning, we introduce a regularized version of the problem by penalizing it with the cumulative residual entropy of the randomized stopping time. The regularized problem takes the form of an (n+1)-dimensional degenerate singular stochastic control with finite-fuel. We address this through the dynamic programming principle, which enables us to identify the unique optimal exploratory strategy. For the specific case of a real option problem, we derive a semi-explicit solution to the regularized problem, allowing us to assess the impact of entropy regularization and analyze the vanishing entropy limit. Finally, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy iteration. We show both policy improvement and policy convergence results for our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Parallel Quasi-Quantum Annealing with Gradient-Based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained attention as general-purpose solvers due to their ability to automatically learn problem-specific heuristics, reducing the need for manually crafted heuristics. However, these methods often face scalability challenges. To address these issues, the improved Sampling algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization (iSCO), using discrete Langevin dynamics, has been proposed, demonstrating better performance than several learning-based solvers. This study proposes a different approach that integrates gradient-based update through continuous relaxation, combined with Quasi-Quantum Annealing (QQA). QQA smoothly transitions the objective function, starting from a simple convex function, minimized at half-integral values, to the original objective function, where the relaxed variables are minimized only in the discrete space. Furthermore, we incorporate parallel run communication leveraging GPUs to enhance exploration capabilities and accelerate convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is a competitive general-purpose solver, achieving performance comparable to iSCO and learning-based solvers across various benchmark problems. Notably, our method exhibits superior speed-quality trade-offs for large-scale instances compared to iSCO, learning-based solvers, commercial solvers, and specialized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Average Reward Temporal Difference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular average reward Temporal Difference (TD) learning is perhaps the simplest and the most fundamental policy evaluation algorithm in average reward reinforcement learning. After at least 25 years since its discovery, we are finally able to provide a long-awaited almost sure convergence analysis. Namely, we are the first to prove that, under very mild conditions, tabular average reward TD converges almost surely to a sample path dependent fixed point. Key to this success is a new general stochastic approximation result concerning nonexpansive mappings with Markovian and additive noise, built on recent advances in stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Causal Representations and the Causal Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct representations that simplify parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach in representation learning that compresses random variables while retaining information about a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces representations which are causally interpretable, and which can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned representations accurately capture causality as intended.</description>
