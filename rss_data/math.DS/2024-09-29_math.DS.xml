      <title>Absolute continuity of stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be two volume preserving, Anosov diffeomorphisms on $\mathbb{T}^2$, sharing common stable and unstable cones. In this paper, we find conditions for the existence of (dissipative) neighborhoods of $f$ and $g$, $\mathcal{U}_f$ and $\mathcal{U}_g$, with the following property: for any probability measure $\mu$, supported on the union of these neighborhoods, and verifying certain conditions, the unique $\mu$-stationary SRB measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the ambient Haar measure. Our proof is inspired in the work of Tsujii for partially hyperbolic endomorphisms [Tsu05]. We also obtain some equidistribution results using the main result of [BRH17].</description>

      <title>Quantitative expansivity for ergodic $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expansiveness properties of positive measure subsets of ergodic $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions along two different types of structured subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, namely, cyclic subgroups and images of integer polynomials. We prove quantitative expansiveness properties in both cases and strengthen combinatorial results obtained by Bj\"orklund and Fish in arXiv:2401.03724, and Bulinski and Fish in arXiv:2102.05862. Our methods unify and strengthen earlier approaches used in arXiv:2401.03724 and arXiv:2102.05862 and to our surprise, also yield a counterexample to a certain pinned variant of the polynomial Bogolyubov theorem.</description>

      <title>Wandering Cauliflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine an orbit of simply connected wandering domains for the function ${f(z) = z\cos z+2\pi}$. They are noteworthy in that they are non-congruent but arise from a simple closed form function. Moreover, the shape of the wandering domains, suitably scaled, converges in the Hausdorff metric to the filled-in parabolic basin of the quadratic ${z^2+c}$ with $c=\tfrac{1}{4}$, commonly named the ``cauliflower''. We complete our analysis by classifying the wandering domains within the ninefold framework in \cite{benini+2021}, finding they are contracting and the diameters of the wandering domains tend to zero. To conclude we propose an expansion of the analysis to a wider family of functions and discuss some potential results.</description>

      <title>Pseudometrics for scalable data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown deriving the pseudometrics from unitary transformations is sufficient to recover a value of zero if two systems are topologically conjugate. Therefore the pseudometrics for quantifying deviation from conjugacy are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Finally, geometric considerations for the Pareto optimality problem associated with deviation from conjugacy are used to develop pseudometrics that account for all possible solutions given just two Pareto points based on analytical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we determine the centers of quasi-homogeneous polynomial planar vector fields of degree 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. In addition, in every case we make a study of the reversibility and the analytical integrability of each one of the above centers.Wefind polynomial centers which are neither orbitally reversible nor analytically integrable, this is a new scenario in respect to the one of non-degenerate and nilpotent centers.</description>

      <title>A [Chern] character defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology rings of tiling spaces $\Omega$ given by cubical substitutions. While there have been many calculations before of cohomology groups of such tiling spaces, the innovation here is that we use computer-assisted methods to compute the cup-product structure. This leads to examples of substitution tilings with isomorphic cohomology groups but different cohomology rings. Part of the interest in studying the cup product comes from Bellissard's gap-labeling conjecture, which is known to hold in dimensions $\le 3$, but where a proof is known in dimensions $\ge 4$ only when the Chern character from $K^0(\Omega)$ to $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Q})$ lands in $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Z})$. Computation of the cup product on cohomology often makes it possible to compute the Chern character. We introduce a natural generalization of the gap-labeling conjecture, called the equivariant gap-labeling conjecture, which applies to tilings with a finite symmetry group. Again this holds in dimensions $\le 3$, but we are able to show that it fails in general in dimensions $\ge 4$. This, plus some of our cup product calculations, makes it plausible that the gap-labeling conjecture might fail in high dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension depend on metrics. In this paper, we investigate the continuity of the metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension concerning the metrics for amenable group actions, which extends recent results by Muentes, Becker, Baraviera et al.. Moreover, we give proof of the product formulas for the mean Hausdorff dimension and the metric mean dimension for amenable group actions.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>The Dirac operator for the pair of Ruelle and Koopman operators, and a generalized Boson formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $\mu$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by $\mathcal{L}$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{L}^*$ the Koopman operator, both acting on $L^2(\mu)$. It is natural to call $\mathfrak{a} = \mathcal{L}$ the annihilation operator, and $\mathfrak{a}^\dag = \mathfrak{c} = \mathcal{K}$ the creation operator (see (*)). We call $\mathcal{K} \mathcal{L} = \mathfrak{c} \mathfrak{a}$ the generalized (dynamical) boson Number operator. In our mathematical framework we consider the following complete orthogonal family of functions in $L^2(\mu)$: given a finite word $w = w_1 w_2 \cdots w_l$, $w_j \in \{0,1\}$, denote $e_w \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu([w])}} \left( \mathfrak{1}_{[w1]} - \mathfrak{1}_{[w0]} \right)$, and add $e_{\emptyset}^1 = \sqrt{2}\,\mathfrak{1}_{[1]}, e_{\emptyset}^0 = - \sqrt{2}\,\mathfrak{1}_{[0]}$ to the family. Claim: $\mathfrak{c}(e_w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( e_{0w} + e_{1w} )$ and $\mathfrak{a} (e_{w_1 w_2 \cdots w_n}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} e_{w_2 w_3 \cdots w_n}$ (*), justifying the above terminology. Here the Dirac operator is:
  $$\mathcal{D}= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
  0 &amp; \mathcal{K}
  \mathcal{L} &amp; 0
  \end{array} \right)$$
  Introducing a natural diagonal representation $\pi$ on the set of bounded operators $L$ acting on $L^2(\mu)$, we set a certain natural spectral triple, and we estimate $\|\,\left[\mathcal{D}, \pi(L)\right]\,\|$ in several cases; $\|\,\left[\mathcal{D}, \pi(L)\right]\,\|\leq 1$ corresponds to saying that the Lipchitz constant of $L$ is $\leq1$. We show that $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(\mathcal{K} \mathcal{L})\right] \,\| = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We give an asymptotic formula as $t\to+\infty$ for the number of common perpendiculars of length at most $t$ between two divergent geodesics or a divergent geodesic and a compact locally convex subset in negatively curved locally symmetric spaces with exponentially mixing geodesic flow, presenting a surprising non-purely exponential growth. We apply this result to count ambiguous geodesics in the modular orbifold recovering results of Sarnak, and to confirm and extend a conjecture of Motohashi on the binary additive divisor problem in imaginary quadratic number fields.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems associated with the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(6, \mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New classes of Lie-Hamilton systems are obtained from the six-dimensional fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(6,\mathbb{R})$. The ansatz is based on a recently proposed procedure for constructing higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through the representation theory of Lie algebras. As applications of the procedure, we study a time-dependent electromagnetic field and several types of coupled oscillators. The irreducible embedding of the special unitary Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ into $\mathfrak{sp}(6, \mathbb{R})$ is also considered, yielding Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the sum of the quark and antiquark three-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, which are applied in the construction of t-dependent coupled systems. In addition, t-independent constants of the motion are obtained explicitly for all these Lie-Hamilton systems, which allows the derivation of a nonlinear superposition rule</description>

      <title>Optimum Configuration for Hovering n-Quadrotors carrying a Slung Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a strategy for organising quadrotors around a payload to enable hovering without external stimuli, together with a MATLAB software for modelling the dynamics of a quadrotor-payload system. Based on geometric concepts, the proposed design keeps the payload and system centre of mass aligned. Hovering tests that are successful confirm the method's efficiency. Moreover, the algorithm is improved to take thrust capacities and propeller distances into account, calculating the minimum number of quadrotors needed for hovering. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical examples, which reveal that larger quadrotors may require fewer units while smaller ones give greater flexibility.

      <title>Stationary Soap Film Bridge Subjected to an Electrostatic Force: The Balanced Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study a stationary free boundary problem describing a soap film bridge subjected to an electrostatic force. Starting from a cylinder that the soap film forms if its surface tension and the electrostatic force are perfectly balanced, we construct a local branch of stationary solutions. Then, we prove that there is a sharp threshold value for a characteristic model parameter at which the stability behaviour of this branch switches from stable to unstable. Finally, we show that the soap film deflects monotonically outwards if the strength of the electrostatic force is increased. Besides rigorous results, we also discuss a possible balancing effect of the electrostatic force.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>Ergodic measures for periodic type $\mathbb{Z}^m$-skew-products over Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a special case of the question of classification of invariant Radon measures of $\mathbb{Z}^m$-valued skew-products over interval exchange transformations, which arise as Poincar\'e sections of the linear flow on periodic infinite translation surfaces. In the case of periodic type skew-products, we obtain a full classification of ergodic invariant Radon measures, showing them to be precisely the Maharam measures, a family of measures parametrised by $\mathbb{R}^m$. For the proof we translate Rauzy-Veech renormalisation for skew-products into the symbolic language of the adic coding, and apply a symbolic result of Aaronson, Nakada, Sarig and Solomyak. Further, we use this language and a new extension of the Rauzy-Veech cocycle to find an explicit form for the Maharam measures and deduce the weak*-continuity of the measures depending on the parameter.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Koopman operator via Bernstein polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator approach provides a powerful linear description of nonlinear dynamical systems in terms of the evolution of observables. While the operator is typically infinite-dimensional, it is crucial to develop finite-dimensional approximation methods and characterize the related approximation errors with upper bounds, preferably expressed in the uniform norm. In this paper, we depart from the traditional use of orthogonal projection or truncation, and propose a novel method based on Bernstein polynomial approximation. Considering a basis of Bernstein polynomials, we construct a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator in a computationally effective way. Building on results of approximation theory, we characterize the rates of convergence and the upper bounds of the error in various contexts including the cases of univariate and multivariate systems, and continuous and differentiable observables. The obtained bounds are expressed in the uniform norm in terms of the modulus of continuity of the observables. Finally, the method is extended to a data-driven setting through a proper change of coordinates, where it is shown to demonstrate good performance for trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>The role of spatial dimension in the emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability has been well studied in two and three dimensional settings and predicted for higher spatial dimensions. We prove the existence of localised $(n+1)$-dimensional radial patterns in general two-component reaction-diffusion systems near a Turing instability, where $n&gt;0$ is taken to be a continuous parameter. We determine explicit dependence of each pattern's radial profile on the dimension $n$ through the introduction of $(n+1)$-dimensional Bessel functions, revealing a deep connection between the formation of localised radial patterns in different spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Windings of prime geodesics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The winding of a closed oriented geodesic around the cusp of the modular orbifold is computed by the Rademacher symbol, a classical function from the theory of modular forms. In this article, we introduce a new construction of winding numbers to record the winding of closed oriented geodesics about a prescribed cusp of a general cusped hyperbolic orbifold. For various arithmetic families of surfaces, this winding number can again be expressed by a Rademacher symbol, and access to the spectral theory of automorphic forms yields statistical results on the distribution of closed (primitive) oriented geodesics with respect to their winding.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and symbolic models of computation with advice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems and physical models defined on idealized continuous phase spaces are known to exhibit non-computable phenomena, examples include the wave equation, recurrent neural networks, or Julia sets in holomorphic dynamics. Inspired by the works of Moore and Siegelmann, we show that ideal fluids, modeled by the Euler equations, are capable of simulating poly-time Turing machines with polynomial advice on compact three-dimensional domains. This is precisely the complexity class $P/poly$ considered by Siegelmann in her study of analog recurrent neural networks. In addition, we introduce a new class of symbolic systems, related to countably piecewise linear transformations of the unit square, that is capable of simulating Turing machines with advice in real-time, contrary to previously known models.</description>

      <title>Response solutions for beam equations with nonlocal nonlinear damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response solutions are quasi-periodic ones with the same frequency as the forcing term. The present work is devoted to the construction of response solutions for $d$-dimensional beam equations with nonlocal nonlinear damping, which model frictional mechanisms affecting the bodies based on the average. By considering $\epsilon$ in a domain that does not include the origin and imposing a small quasi-periodic forcing with Diophantine frequency vector, we can show the existence of the response solution for such a model. We present an alternative approach to the contraction mapping principle (cf. [5, 33]) through a combination of reduction together with the Nash--Moser iteration technique. The reason behind this approach lies in the derivative losses caused by the nonlocal nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat (and in some situations non-flat) principal bundles under a suitable ergodicity assumption.
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

      <title>The number of periodic points of surface symplectic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use symplectic tools to establish a smooth variant of Franks theorem for a closed orientable surface of positive genus $g$; it implies that a symplectic diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity with more than $2g-2$ fixed points, counted homologically, has infinitely many periodic points. Furthermore, we present examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms with a prescribed number of periodic points. In particular, we construct symplectic flows on surfaces possessing only one fixed point and no other periodic orbits.</description>
