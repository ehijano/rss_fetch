      <title>Taylor-Model Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters, initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs. These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical systems modeled as ODEs.</description>

      <title>Computing in complete local equicharacteristic Noetherian rings via topological rewriting on commutative formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In commutative algebra, the theory of Gr\"obner bases enables one to compute in any finitely generated algebra over a given computable field. For non-finitely generated algebras however, other methods have to be pursued. For instance, it follows from the Cohen structure theorem that standard bases of formal power series ideals offer a similar prospect but for complete local equicharacteristic rings whose residue field is computable. Using the language of rewriting theory, one can characterise Gr\"obner bases in terms of confluence of the induced rewriting system. It has been shown, so far via purely algebraic tools, that an analogous characterisation holds for standard bases with a generalised notion of confluence. Subsequently, that result is utilised to prove that two generalised confluence properties, where one is actually in general strictly stronger than the other, are actually equivalent in the context of formal power series. In the present paper, we propose alternative proofs making use of tools purely from the new theory of topological rewriting to recover both the characterisation of standard bases and the equivalence between generalised confluence properties. The objective is to extend the analogy between Gr\"obner basis theory together with classical algebraic rewriting theory and standard basis theory with topological rewriting theory.</description>

      <title>Verified Language Processing with Hybrid Explainability: A Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing, for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication, inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from extensive textual data.</description>

      <title>Rational Solutions of Parametric First-Order Algebraic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an algorithm for finding general rational solutions of a given first-order ODE with parametric coefficients that occur rationally. We present an analysis, complete modulo Hilbert's irreducibility problem, of the existence of rational solutions of the differential equation, with parametric coefficients, when the parameters are specialized.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem $R(3, k)$ seeks to determine the smallest value of $n$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on $n$ vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size $k$. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey $R(3, k)$ problem such as $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MathCheck to generate certificates for Ramsey problems $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ (and symmetrically $R(8, 3)$ and $R(9, 3)$) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating an improvement of several orders of magnitude in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves $R(3, 8)$ (resp., $R(8, 3)$) sequentially in 59 hours (resp., in 11 hours), while a SAT-only approach using state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problems $R(3, 9)$ and $R(9, 3)$ we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>
