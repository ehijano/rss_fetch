      <title>Decoding Cellular Temperature via Neural Network-Aided Fluorescent Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature distribution within cells, especially the debates on mitochondrial temperature, has recently attracted widespread attention. Some studies have claimed that the temperature of mitochondria can reach up to 50-53 degrees Celsius. Yet others have questioned that this is due to measurement errors from fluorescent thermometry caused by other factors, like cell viscosity. Here we present a neural network-aided fluorescent thermometry and decouple the effect of cellular viscosity on temperature measurements. We found that cellular viscosity may cause significant deviations in temperature measurements. We investigated the dynamic temperature changes in different organelles within the cell under stimulation and observed a distinct temperature gradient within the cell. Eliminating the influence of viscosity, the upper limit of mitochondrial temperature does not exceed 42-43 degrees Celsius, supporting our knowledge about the inactivation temperature of enzymes. The temperature of mitochondria is closely related to their functions and morphology, such as fission and fusion. Our results help to clarify the question of "how hot are mitochondria?" and promote a better understanding on cellular thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Many Will Enter, Few Will Win: Cost and Sensitivity of Exploratory Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of biomolecular systems rely on exploratory dynamics to reach target locations or states within a cell. Without a mechanism to remotely sense and direct motion towards a target, the system must sample over many paths, often including resetting transitions back to the origin. We explore how exploratory dynamics can confer an important functional benefit: the ability to respond to small changes in parameters with large shifts in the steady-state behavior. However, such enhanced sensitivity comes at a cost: resetting cycles require energy dissipation in order to push the system out of its equilibrium steady state. We focus on two concrete examples: translational proofreading in the ribosome and microtubule length control via dynamic instability to illustrate the trade-offs between energetic cost and sensitivity. In the former, a thermodynamically driven activation step enhances the ability to distinguish between substrates and decoys with small binding energy differences. In the latter, resetting cycles enable catalytic control, with the steady-state length distribution modulated by sub-stoichiometric concentrations of a reusable catalyst. Synthesizing past models of these well-studied systems, we show how path-counting and circuit mapping approaches can be used to address fundamental questions such as the number of futile cycles inherent in translation and the steady-state length distribution of a dynamically unstable polymer. In both cases, a limited amount of thermodynamic driving is sufficient to yield a qualitative transition to a system with enhanced sensitivity, enabling accurate discrimination and catalytic control at a modest energetic cost.</description>

      <title>Maximal response to a mechanical leader at critical group size in ant collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that biological collectives operate near criticality to amplify their capability of collective response. The peak in susceptibility near criticality renders these groups highly responsive to external stimuli. While this phenomenon has been recognized and supported by evidence from theory, a direct experimental demonstration has been elusive. To bridge this gap, here we record the response of a group of Paratrechina longicornis ants to external stimuli as they join efforts to carry food to their nest. Using a robotic system that mimics a transient leader, we apply tactile ant-scale forces and measure the group's response at sub, near, and supercritical regimes. Supported by theory and simulations, we provide direct experimental evidence to demonstrate that at critical group size, the collective response of the ants to an external force is maximally amplified.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamical suspension model for blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete thermodynamical analysis for a blood model, based on mixture theory, is performed. The model is developed considering the blood as a suspension of red blood cells (solid component) in the plasma (fluid component), and taking into account the temperature effects. Furthermore, two independent scalar internal variables are introduced accounting for additional dissipative effects. Using Clausius-Duhem inequality, the general thermodynamic restrictions and residual dissipation inequality are derived. The thermodynamic admissibility with the second law of thermodynamics is assessed by means of the extended Coleman-Noll procedure; in one space dimension we exhibit a solution of all the thermodynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>Advanced Nanostructured Topical Therapeutics for Psoriasis: Strategic Synthesis, Multimodal Characterization, and Preliminary Pharmacodynamic Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psoriasis is a long-term inflammatory skin disease that remains difficult to treat. In this study, we developed a new topical treatment by combining metal oxide nanoparticles: cerium oxide (CeO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver (Ag), with natural plant extracts in a gel made from fish collagen and agar. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showing good stability and a uniform particle size distribution (ZnO averaged 66 nm).
  To enhance therapeutic potential, the gel was enriched with plant-derived antioxidants from bitter melon, ginger, and neem. This formulation was tested on an animal model of psoriasis. The treated group exhibited faster wound healing and reduced inflammation compared to both placebo and untreated groups, with statistically significant results (p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 0.001) observed from Day 3, becoming more pronounced by Day 14.
  These results indicate that the combination of nanoparticles with plant-based components in a topical gel may provide a promising new approach to psoriasis treatment. Further studies are recommended to evaluate long-term safety and therapeutic effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Nanoelectrospray ionization coupled to a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer for single viral particles analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a new charge detection mass spectrometer (CDMS) design that operates in a stand-alone mode, thanks to its integration with nanoelectrospray ionization. More specifically, this innovative CDMS consists of a linear charge detection array ion trap spectrometer that combines an eight-tube detector array with conical electrodes. This configuration allows for recording data in both transmission mode (linear array) and ion trapping mode (ConeArrayTrap), which enables the measurement of time-of-flight (related to the mass-to-charge ratio) along with the charge of individual ions. As a result, this design supports high-throughput metrology of viruses at the single-particle level. The devices and geometry of the instrument have been developed based on ion optics simulations. The performance of the current instrument is demonstrated using human norovirus-like particles (hNoVLP) and Adenovirus Ad(5) (hAdV5).</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining dynamics to maximize irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many far-from-equilibrium biological systems, energy injected by irreversible processes at microscopic scales propagates to larger scales to fulfill important biological functions. But given dissipative dynamics at the microscale, how much irreversibility can persist at the macroscale? Here, we propose a model-free coarse-graining procedure that merges microscopic states to minimize the amount of lost irreversibility. Beginning with dynamical measurements, this procedure produces coarse-grained dynamics that retain as much information as possible about the underlying irreversibility. In synthetic and experimental data spanning molecular motors, biochemical oscillators, and recordings of neural activity, we derive simplified descriptions that capture the essential nonequilibrium processes. These results provide the tools to study the fundamental limits on the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated. In this study, from a functional perspective, we computationally investigate the impact of Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations through parameter variation. Our simulation results reveal that delayed Pi-release can significantly enhance energy efficiency during muscle contraction. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the ionization of protein crystals by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms (Z &gt; 10) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by rapidly seeding electron ionization cascades. In a typical protein crystal, sulfur atoms and solvated salts induce a substantial fraction of light-atom ionization. In further modeling of various targets, global ionization peaks at photon energies roughly 2 keV above inner-shell absorption edges, as sub-2 keV photoelectrons ejected from these shells initiate ionization cascades that are briefer than the XFEL pulse. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in XFEL experiments.</description>

      <title>Prospects for NMR Spectral Prediction on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced atomic magnetometers have made it possible to acquire nuclear magnetic resonance spectra in zero to ultralow magnetic fields. This regime carries the benefit of compact, low-cost instrumentation with reduced spin relaxation effects and the ability to probe phenomena that are inaccessible in conventional high-field experiments. A tradeoff is that the resulting spectra must be interpreted using simulations that are taxing for classical computation. Working by example for small-molecule and protein spectroscopy, we demonstrate that these simulations are a promising target for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our holistic analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits for qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how certain cases might be especially promising for early fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>
