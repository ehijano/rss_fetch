      <title>Complexity of Deciding the Equality of Matching Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching is said to be disconnected if the saturated vertices induce a disconnected subgraph and induced if the saturated vertices induce a 1-regular graph. The disconnected and induced matching numbers are defined as the maximum cardinality of such matchings, respectively, and are known to be NP-hard to compute. In this paper, we study the relationship between these two parameters and the matching number. In particular, we discuss the complexity of two decision problems; first: deciding if the matching number and disconnected matching number are equal; second: deciding if the disconnected matching number and induced matching number are equal. We show that given a bipartite graph with diameter four, deciding if the matching number and disconnected matching number are equal is NP-complete; the same holds for bipartite graphs with maximum degree three. We characterize diameter three graphs with equal matching number and disconnected matching number, which yields a polynomial time recognition algorithm. Afterwards, we show that deciding if the induced and disconnected matching numbers are equal is co-NP-complete for bipartite graphs of diameter 3. When the induced matching number is large enough compared to the maximum degree, we characterize graphs where these parameters are equal, which results in a polynomial time algorithm for bounded degree graphs.</description>

      <title>Adjacency Labeling Schemes for Small Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class admits an implicit representation if, for every positive integer $n$, its $n$-vertex graphs have a $O(\log n)$-bit (adjacency) labeling scheme, i.e., their vertices can be labeled by binary strings of length $O(\log n)$ such that the presence of an edge between any pair of vertices can be deduced solely from their labels. The famous Implicit Graph Conjecture posited that every hereditary (i.e., closed under taking induced subgraphs) factorial (i.e., containing $2^{O(n \log n)}$ $n$-vertex graphs) class admits an implicit representation. The conjecture was recently refuted [Hatami and Hatami, FOCS '22], and does not even hold among monotone (i.e., closed under taking subgraphs) factorial classes [Bonnet et al., ICALP '24]. However, monotone small (i.e., containing at most $n! c^n$ many $n$-vertex graphs for some constant $c$) classes do admit implicit representations.
  This motivates the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture: Every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log n)$-bit labeling scheme. We provide evidence supporting the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture. First, we show that every small weakly sparse (i.e., excluding some fixed bipartite complete graph as a subgraph) class has an implicit representation. This is a consequence of the following fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every weakly sparse small class has bounded expansion (hence, in particular, bounded degeneracy). Second, we show that every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log^3 n)$-bit labeling scheme, which provides a substantial improvement of the best-known polynomial upper bound of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ on the size of adjacency labeling schemes for such classes. This is a consequence of another fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every small class has neighborhood complexity $O(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>A step towards finding the analog of the Four-Color Theorem for $(n,m)$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An \textit{$(n,m)$-graph} $G$ is a graph having both arcs and edges, and its arcs (resp., edges) are labeled using one of the $n$ (resp., $m$) different symbols. An \textit{$(n,m)$-complete graph} $G$ is an $(n,m)$-graph without loops or multiple edges in its underlying graph such that identifying any pair of vertices results in a loop or parallel adjacencies with distinct labels. We show that a planar $(n,m)$-complete graph cannot have more than $3(2n+m)^2+(2n+m)+1$ vertices, for all $(n,m) \neq (0,1)$ and the bound is tight. This answers a naturally fundamental extremal question in the domain of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs and positively settles a recent conjecture by Bensmail \textit{et al.}~[Graphs and Combinatorics 2017]. Essentially, our result finds the clique number for planar $(n,m)$-graphs, which is a difficult problem except when $(n,m)=(0,1)$, answering a sub-question to finding the chromatic number for the family of planar $(n,m)$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Degree-Kirchhoff, Gutman, and Schultz Indices in Pentagonal Cylinders and M\"{o}bius Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-Kirchhoff index of a connected graph is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix, each multiplied by the graph's total degree. Several studies have recently obtained explicit formulations for the degree-Kirchhoff index of various kinds of class graphs. This paper presents closed-form formulas for the degree-Kirchhoff index of pentagonal cylinders and M\"{o}bius chains. Additionally, we calculate the Gutman index and Schultz index for these graphs.</description>

      <title>EPPA numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $G$ is a graph, $A$ and $B$ its induced subgraphs, and $f\colon A\to B$ an isomorphism, we say that $f$ is a \emph{partial automorphism} of $G$. In 1992, Hrushovski proved that graphs have the \emph{extension property for partial automorphisms} (\emph{EPPA}, also called the \emph{Hrushovski property}), that is, for every finite graph $G$ there is a finite graph $H$, an \emph{EPPA-witness} for $G$, such that $G$ is an induced subgraph of $H$ and every partial automorphism of $G$ extends to an automorphism of $H$.
  The EPPA number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(G)$, is the smallest number of vertices of an EPPA-witness for $G$, and we put $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(n) = \max\{\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(G) : \lvert G\rvert = n\}$. In this note we review the state of the area, prove several lower bounds (in particular, we show that $\mathop{\mathrm{eppa}}\nolimits(n)\geq \frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}$, thereby identifying the correct base of the exponential) and pose many open questions. We also briefly discuss EPPA numbers of hypergraphs, directed graphs, and $K_k$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Tight (Double) Exponential Bounds for Identification Problems: Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. We prove the (tight) conditional lower bounds for these problems when parameterized by treewidth and solution as. Formally, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|))$. This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth. Then, we first prove that \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails. To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. Finally, we prove that \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|)$. This is also a rare example of the problem that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.
  We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds.</description>

      <title>An asymptotically optimal algorithm for generating bin cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the balls-into-bins setting, $n$ balls are thrown uniformly at random into $n$ bins. The na\"{i}ve way to generate the final load vector takes $\Theta(n)$ time. However, it is well-known that this load vector has with high probability bin cardinalities of size $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. Here, we present an algorithm in the RAM model that generates the bin cardinalities of the final load vector in the optimal $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ time in expectation and with high probability.
  Further, the algorithm that we present is still optimal for any $m \in [n, n \log n]$ balls and can also be used as a building block to efficiently simulate more involved load balancing algorithms. In particular, for the Two-Choice algorithm, which samples two bins in each step and allocates to the least-loaded of the two, we obtain roughly a quadratic speed-up over the na\"{i}ve simulation.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>
