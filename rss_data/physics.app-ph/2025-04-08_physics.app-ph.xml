      <title>Leaky Mode Generation by means of All-Metal Corrugated Slotted Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leaky-wave antennas support the generation of highly directional beams by means of planar and low-profile structures. Designs based on periodic cells provide frequency scanning both in backward and forward directions. In this letter we propose a new method to generate leaky modes with an all-metal periodic 2-D waveguide (i.e., invariant along the direction normal to the propagation). First, Periodic corrugations within a parallel plate waveguide are introduced to support a slow wave, which is suitably perturbed with periodic slots etched on the top plate. This transforms the slow wave in fast waves: a suitable choice of the two periods lead to a single fast backward-forward spatial harmonic being responsible for well-defined and directional radiation. The proposed method is proved here proposing an original and new unit cell, optimized to suppress the open stop band. The analysis and the design is accomplished with a rigorous periodic method of moments allowing for the computation of complex modes in open 2-D waveguides. The corresponding 1-D leaky-wave antenna is studied and validated by means of full-wave simulations in Ka band. The structure features continuous beam scanning with broadside radiation at 29.6 GHz with an all-metal compact design.</description>

      <title>Landauer-Limited Dissipation in Quantum-Flux-Parametron Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landauer limit is to irreversible logic what the Carnot cycle is to heat engines. This limit is approached in the adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (aQFP) by copying the inputs of standard logic gates to produce reversible logic gates, and disposing of the copied inputs using the "terminate" gate dissipating only the thermal energy, ln2$kT$. This method eliminates the non-adiabatic switching associated with backaction that arises in conventional aQFP logic. Real aQFP devices have parameter mismatch causing proportionate increases in dissipation and bit-error rate. A chip with $10^9$ aQFPs with realistic fabrication spread of 1%-1$\sigma$ control on junction critical current and 5%-1$\sigma$ on inductors would have outlier devices with a bit-error rate of $10^{-31}$, compared to $10^{-71}$ for ideal devices. Power dissipation across all devices on-chip would increase to about 7$\times$ the Landauer limit. An ideal circuit processing correlated bit streams dissipates fractional bit energy per cycle commensurate with the information lost, in accord with Landauer's concept of logical entropy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dislocation Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries, has garnered significant attention in both fundamental physics and emerging applications. Recent theoretical studies unveiled a distinctive dislocation NHSE by disentangling it from the established boundary NHSE, thereby bridging the gap between topological defects and non-Hermitian effects. In this Letter, we report the first experimental observation of the dislocation NHSE, achieved using an ingeniously designed nonreciprocal, torus-like acoustic lattice with two dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors. Our results show that the sound energy density inside the sample dramatically accumulates at one dislocation, while being unusually depleted at the other, a response distinct from all existing NHSE phenomena. This novel non-Hermitian effect not only probes the interplay between nontrivial defects and point-gap topology, but also holds promise for practical applications, such as the design of topological sound vacuum pumps.</description>

      <title>Performances of far and near-field thermophotonic refrigeration devices from the detailed-balance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a near-field thermophotonic (NF-TPX) refrigerating device, consisting of a lightemitting diode and a photovoltaic cell in close proximity. Calculations are performed in the frame of the detailed-balance approach. We study how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect both cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess the impact of bandgap energy and internal quantum efficiency for an artificial material on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs and/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10% reduction of the quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on electroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance prediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling devices.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$~Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or strong spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results lead to several testable hypotheses that can be explored in experiments.</description>

      <title>Vortex transition and thermal mixing by pitching a perforated flexible panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective transport of heat and mass is crucial to both industrial applications and physiological processes. Recent research has evaluated the benefit of using flexible reeds for triggering the vortex induced vibration to enhance mixing, as opposed to traditional techniques like rigid blender or static meshes. Inspired by the soft, porous, and moving fish gill lamellae, we proposed a new concept of thermal dispenser that prescribes active pitching motion to the leading edge of an otherwise passively flapping perforated panel. Experimental measurements revealed drastic differences between the steady leaky flow wake behind a statically deflected perforated panel and the periodic shedding wakes with complex vortex structure transitions behind an actuated perforated panel with or without chord-wise flexibility. A semi-empirical simulation of the thermal convection and diffusion takes the experimentally obtained velocity as input and yields the temperature results. Vortex dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures, and thermal mixing behaviors were analyzed and compared to elucidate the effects of kinematics, perforation, and flexibility on the wake mode transitions, lateral entrainment mixing, and overall heating. Our work provides a foundational understanding of the fluid-structure interactions of perforated bendable panels under active control which has not been described before in the intermediate Reynolds number range. It provides insights for developing an innovative bio-inspired heat or mass dispenser potentially suitable for subtle and small scale applications.</description>

      <title>The asymmetric rotating saddle potential as a mechanical analog to the RF Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under specific conditions, a rotating saddle potential can confine the motion of a particle on its surface. This time-varying hyperbolic potential shares key characteristics with the RF electric quadrupole ion trap (RF Paul trap), making it a valuable mechanical analog. Previous work has primarily focused on symmetric saddles, characterized by equal curvatures along the trapping and anti-trapping directions. However, most applications of RF Paul traps-such as atomic clocks, quantum computing, and quantum simulations-require asymmetry in the quadrupole potential to break the degeneracy of motional modes, which is essential for processes like laser cooling and other quantum manipulations. In this paper, we investigate the motion of trapped particles in asymmetric rotating saddles. We demonstrate that even minor asymmetries, including those arising from manufacturing imperfections, can significantly affect particle trajectories and stability. Our analysis includes both theoretical modeling and experimental measurements. We derive the equations of motion for asymmetric saddles and solve them to explore stability and precession effects. Additionally, we present lifetime measurements of particles in saddles with varying degrees of asymmetry to map key features of the a-q stability diagram, including counterintuitive demonstrations of stability for saddles with negative asymmetry. This study underscores the importance of incorporating asymmetry into mechanical models of ion traps to better reflect real-world implementations. Although motivated primarily by RF Paul traps, these asymmetry-related results are also relevant to emerging gravitational analogs, such as rotating saddle potentials in certain binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Direct density estimation using muon radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muography or muon radiography estimates the density distribution of natural or anthropic structures by measuring the traversing flux of atmospheric muons. Muography has been implemented to image volcanoes, glaciers, tunnels, line-shores, pyramids, and dams. The mass variation of the structure is deduced by the ratio between the open-sky muon flux and the target traversing flux, resulting in a relative measurement of the density. We present a novel method for directly measuring the average density of the target. The methodology uses known muography variables such as open-sky and traversing muon flux, incident zenith angle, and muon path length. We validated the method with muography-simulated data from iron, aluminum, standard rock and water phantoms, as well as real data from the Khufu pyramid, the Eiger Glacier, and the Canfranc Underground Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of semi-cylindrical channels for one-dimensional fiber array edge couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are essential for high-speed and compact optoelectronic applications, yet efficient optical coupling to PIC remains a critical challenge, where minimizing insertion losses is crucial for high-performance applications. Fiber arrays are commonly used as edge couplers for PICs. In this work, we demonstrate the fabrication of semi-cylindrical channels on glass substrates using femtosecond laser micromachining for fiber arrays edge couplers. This method enables the formation of narrow, well-defined grooves in glass substrates with submicron accuracy, facilitating reliable fiber positioning for improved coupling efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for dense fiber arrays, with a narrow separation of \sim 3 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>Three strongly coupled Kerr parametric oscillators forming a Boltzmann machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a promising resource for classical and quantum analog computation, for example to find the ground state of Ising Hamiltonians. Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement. While fully classical, our work is directly relevant for quantum systems operating on coherent states.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N sputtered thin films on n-type Si bottom electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N thin films are grown on highly doped and plasma treated (100) n-type Si. We demonstrate ferroelectricity for x = &lt;0.01, 0.02, 0.06, 0.08, 0.13, and 0.17 where the n-type Si is both the substrate and bottom electrode. Polarization hysteresis reveals remanent polarization values between 130-140 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and coercive field values as low as 4 MV/cm at 1 Hz with low leakage. The highest re-sistivity and most saturating hysteresis occurs with B contents between x = 0.06 and 0.13. We also demonstrate the impact of substrate plasma treatment time on Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N crystallinity and switching. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectra reveal an amorphous 3.5 nm SiNx layer at the Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N interface post-plasma treatment and deposition. The first $\sim 5$ nm of Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N is crystallographically defective. Using the n-type Si substrate we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N thick-ness scaling to 25 nm via low frequency hysteresis and CV. Serving as the bottom electrode and sub-strate, the n-type Si enables a streamlined growth process for Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N for a wide range of Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N compositions and layer thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Design and simulation of GaSe hybrid photonic waveguides on a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of a novel material platform combining Gallium Selenide (GaSe) with a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate and Al2O3 cladding for advanced photonic waveguides. The numerical investigation of the optical performance of GaSe-based waveguides focuses on key parameters such as power confinement factor (PCF), propagation loss, and effective mode index for both of the modes of Transverse Electric (TE) as well as Transverse Magnetic (TM). The results demonstrate that the GaSe/Al2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 waveguide exhibits excellent optical confinement, with PCF values exceeding 96% for both the TE and TM modes at a wavelength of 1.55 {\mu}m. The waveguide also shows low propagation losses, particularly for the TM mode, making it suitable for long-wavelength applications. Furthermore, the study highlights the impact of core dimensions and cladding height on waveguide performance, providing insights into optimizing the design for minimal loss and maximal efficiency that demonstrates the potential of III-VI compound-based waveguides. This treatise also focuses on the bending losses by varying the wavelength and bending radius for both of the TE and TM mode of the GaSe-based waveguide. The waveguide shows the reflecting loss of -25.08 dB and transmission loss of -5.97 dB for the bending radius of 2 {\mu}m and wavelength of 1.55 {\mu}m. This work underscores the potential of GaSe-based waveguides on a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform for next-generation photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Structural Defects and Charge Transport Dynamics in MA and FA Modified CsSnI3 Thin Film Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing high conductivity in microcrystalline thin-films, CsSnI3 perovskite is a promising semiconductor for thermoelectrics and optoelectronics. Rapid oxidation of thin-film and intrinsic lattice strain hinders stabilization of the device performance. Cation engineering of perovskite molecule was considered as an effective strategy to tailor the structural properties and suppress the degradation processes. However, molecular engineering demands a thorough analysis of defect behavior, as it can influence ionic motion, recombination dynamics, and capacitive effects. The effective implementation of CsSnI3 in energy conversion devices requires careful consideration of the specific properties of thin films electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, as well as electronic transients, and charge transport in the device structures. In this work, we performed a complex investigation for modified CsSnI3 through cation substitution with methyl ammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA). Our findings highlight a complex interplay between electrical parameters of the bare thin films and stability of the devices (p-i-n diodes) after thermal stress. FA-CsSnI3 showed beneficial results for stabilization under elevated temperatures with improved non-ideality factor in diode structures, enhanced shunt properties and reduced trapping. The photo-induced voltage relaxation spectroscopy performed for MA-CsSnI3 showed relevant traps concentration of 1016 cm-3 with activation energy of 0.52 eV(210K) likely attributed to Sn atom defect. The obtained results are deeply analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid single shot spin readout is a key ingredient for fault tolerant quantum computing with spin qubits. An RF-SET (radio-frequency single electron transistor) is predominantly used as its the readout timescale is far shorter than the spin decoherence time. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a transmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor assembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium inductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF reflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need for directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the signal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot charge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of RF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is found to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration times are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry set-ups. Furthermore, we study the turn-on properties of the RF-SET to investigate capacitive shifts and RF losses. Understanding these effects are crucial for further optimisations of the impedance transforming network as well as the device design to assist RF read-out. This new RF read-out scheme also shows promise for multiplexing spin-qubit readout and further studies on rapid charge dynamics in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Control and Transient Spectroscopy of Engineered Spin-Cavity Back-Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental arrangement that permits engineering of cavity back-action on a mesoscopic spin ensemble. By coupling a superconducting thin-film Nb microstrip resonator to a Trityl OX63 electron spin sample, we access different regimes of spin-cavity dynamics by designing the ensemble size, effective coupling strength, cavity temperature, and spin saturation. We performed transient spectroscopy measurements under continuous microwave drive in the strong radiation damping regime. These measurements exhibit a long-lived plateau response that distinguishes important features of spin-cavity models, such as the radiation damping Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations. We demonstrate control of the plateau response through adjustment of temperature, microwave drive power, and variable spin saturation. The presented experimental arrangement serves as a robust system to explore the space of spin-cavity dynamics and develop new quantum devices that harness the complexity of mesoscopic spin ensembles coherently interacting with high quality factor cavities.</description>

      <title>A Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS) for Terahertz Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging has emerged as a promising technology in medical diagnostics due to its non-ionizing radiation and high sensitivity to water content. However, conventional THz imaging systems face limitations such as slow mechanical scanning, restricted field of view, and poor telecentricity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS), a novel dual-mirror scanning design optimized for high-speed, distortion-free imaging. The system employs a telecentric f-theta lens and is validated using ray tracing and physical optics simulations. It achieves uniform resolution across a 50 mm x 50 mm field of view without the need for mechanical translation stages. Broadband spectral imaging of a USAF resolution test target across WR-2.2 (325-500 GHz) and WR-1.5 (500-700 GHz) frequency bands demonstrates consistent beam focus and minimal distortion, with a maximum deviation of 2.7 degrees from normal incidence and a beam waist of 2.1 lambda at the field edge in the WR-1.5 band. The system's sensitivity to hydration dynamics is further validated through imaging of wet tissue paper, capturing temporal changes in water content. In vivo imaging of human skin after capsaicin patch application reveals localized hydration variations due to biochemical response and adhesive removal. These findings confirm the system's potential for real-time hydration sensing and dermatological evaluation. TORIS sets a new benchmark in THz imaging, with applications in clinical diagnostics, wound assessment, and material characterization.</description>

      <title>Modal interactions between a linear oscillator and a nonlinear absorber: multiscale energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been given to the use of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) as a nonlinear absorber. The NES is an efficient passive control device, which has been the focus of extensive research. This paper uses the Complexification-Averaging/Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (CX-A/GSPT) to investigate the multiscale energy transfers in a forced two-DOF system coupled to a grounded NES (GNES) with both nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping. Due to the coexistence of fundamental resonance and internal resonance in the system, complex modal interactions occur between the linear oscillator (LO) and the GNES. In addition, the ratio of the mass of the GNES and the LO can be seen as a perturbation. This may lead to the occurrence of multiscale dynamics and energy transfers in the system. By using the CX-A method, the slow flow equations of the system can be obtained. Further application of GSPT can obtain the critical manifold that is equivalent to the so-called slow invariant manifold (SIM). With different values of nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping, the critical manifolds have different structures. These critical manifolds can capture diverse types of system responses. Moreover, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is used to analyze the time-frequency-energy relationship of system response. With different parameters, the instantaneous frequencies of the responses of the LO and GNES show a completely different change. The Hilbert spectrums confirm the occurrence of complex modal interactions and different time-scale energy transfers in the system.</description>

      <title>Toward Carnot efficient high output power heat engines using bubbly two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic gas power cycles achieving Carnot efficiency require isothermal expansion, which is associated with slow processes and results in negligible power output. This study proposes a practical method for rapid near-isothermal gas expansion, facilitating efficient heat engines without sacrificing power. The method involves bubble expansion in a heat transfer liquid, ensuring efficient and near-isothermal heat exchange. The mixture is accelerated through a converging-diverging nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy, thereby rotating a reaction turbine for electricity generation. Nozzle experiments with air and water yielded a polytropic index &lt;1.052, enabling up to 71% more work extraction than adiabatic expansion. Simulations indicate that utilizing these nozzles for thrust generation enables decreasing heat transfer irreversibilities in the heat engine, consequently resulting in up to 22.6% higher power output than an ideal heat engine based on the organic Rankine cycle. This work paves the way for an efficient and high-power heat-to-power solution.</description>

      <title>High Gain and Broadband Metalens Antenna for Terahertz Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) metalens antennas with compact planar structures have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing gain and aperture efficiency through beam convergence. However, research on THz wireless communication systems utilizing metalens antennas remains limited, primarily due to insufficient collaborative enhancement in gain and bandwidth in THz transceiver design. In this paper, we propose a high gain metalens antenna transceiver and demonstrate its application for THz communication. The system employs a horn antenna integrated with a 3D-printed bracket to enhance the metalens gain and operating bandwidth, where the metalens adopts a "sandwich" architecture composed of a V-shaped copper resonator, a dielectric substrate, and a grating. The resonant design inside the metalens facilitates high polarization conversion efficiency and full phase modulation across a 0{\deg} to 360{\deg} range at frequency between 0.20 to 0.30 THz band. Experimental results demonstrate a peak gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture efficiency of 54.45% at 0.244 THz, with a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 33 GHz. A prototype communication system incorporating the metalens transceiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) reduction by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional horn antennas and supports a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps. This proposed metalens offer a high-gain, compact solution for achieving high data rate THz communications, driving advancements in 6G communication network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stirling engine is a type of heat engine known as its high efficiency. It is applied in solar thermal power, cogeneration, space nuclear power, and other fields. Although there are many different types of Stirling engines, their airflow paths are always linear. This article designs two types of Stirling engines with loop airflow path: the O-type engines without regenerator and the 8-type engines with regenerator. The modeling and simulation of the O-type engines show its extremely excellent performance compared with the conventional Stirling engine. Because the regenerator is the main loss and power limitation in Stirling engines, O-type engines do not have this limitation. At the same time, its design without regenerator makes it more practical and has greater potential in terms of power. The 8-type engines use its unique 8-type airflow path to allow gas to enter the regenerator in advance, eliminating the almost useless four heat exchanges, resulting in higher thermal efficiency and better robustness.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The resulting nonsmooth boundary conditions can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. The system is modeled as piecewise linear with different boundary conditions determining different regions of a hybrid phase space. With kick strength as parameter, its bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to estimate the system's intrinsic dimensionality. However, conventional POD's purely statistical analysis of spatial covariance does not guarantee accuracy of reduced order models (ROMs). We therefore augment POD by employing a previously-developed energy closure criterion that selects ROM dimension by ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This physics-based criterion yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated at particular values of the kick strength can nevertheless reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original nonlinear structural system. We thus show that energy closure analysis reliably yields effective dimension estimates and, thereby, ROMs that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Structured Surfaces for Diffractive Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide design is crucial in developing efficient light delivery systems, requiring meticulous material selection, precise manufacturing, and rigorous performance optimization, including dispersion engineering. Here, we introduce universal diffractive waveguide designs that can match the performance of any conventional dielectric waveguide and achieve various functionalities. Optimized using deep learning, our diffractive waveguide designs can be cascaded to each other to form any desired length and are comprised of transmissive diffractive surfaces that permit the propagation of desired guided modes with low loss and high mode purity. In addition to guiding the targeted modes along the propagation direction through cascaded diffractive units, we also developed various waveguide components and introduced bent diffractive waveguides, rotating the direction of mode propagation, as well as spatial and spectral mode filtering and mode splitting diffractive waveguide designs, and mode-specific polarization-maintaining diffractive waveguides, showcasing the versatility of this platform. This diffractive waveguide framework was experimentally validated in the terahertz (THz) spectrum using 3D-printed diffractive layers to selectively pass certain spatial modes while rejecting others. Diffractive waveguides can be scaled to operate at different wavelengths, including visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, without the need for material dispersion engineering, providing an alternative to traditional waveguide components. This advancement will have potential applications in telecommunications, imaging, sensing and spectroscopy, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As an experimental proof of concept, we demonstrate negative refractive function at the terahertz part of the spectrum using a 3D-printed material. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with duplex qubits of silicon vacancy centers in SiC at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between $|m=\pm 3/2\rangle$ and $|m=\pm 1/2\rangle$ states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between $|+1/2\rangle$ and $|-1/2\rangle$ states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., $\left\{|+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ states) leaves the population in the remaining state ($|-1/2\rangle$) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate $\left\{ |+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ and $\left\{ |-1/2\rangle, |-3/2\rangle \right\}$. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are, respectively, driven by disorder and non-reciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian (NH) version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate localization-delocalization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between AL and NHSE can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate quantum jumps between the NH-induced skin states and the AL states to occur in the system. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The localization properties of our model can be studied by analyzing the voltage profile (VP) of the circuit. The VP exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the NHSE, while the phenomenon of AL can be perceived via the localization of the VP in the vicinity of the excitation node where the power supply is connected. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the VP. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the NH AA model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits that should open avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic devices, such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient information transfer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances.

Abstract: Griffin plot relates the peak amplitudes of vortex-induced vibration to structrual mass-damping parameter, known as the Scruton number. Griffin plot serves as a fundamental tool in many engineering fields. This study confirms a general self-similarity in Griffin plots, where plots derived from transient responses at any Scruton number converge to a single, consisten curve. This self-similarity arises from weak aeroelastic nonlinearity in vortex-induced vibration, manifasting as amplitude-dependent aerodynamic damping. Based on this self-similarity property, we propose a numerical method to estimate Griffin plots from transient displacement responses at any Scruton number. The resulting plots align closely with experimental data for both cross-flow and torsional vortex-induced vibrations, highlighting robust self-similar behavior across different Scruton numbers. Furthermore, we observe a consistent trend in Griffin plots for a rectangular cylinder, closed-box, and double-girder bridge deck: the reciprocal of peak amplitudes shows an approximately linear relationship with the Scruton number, especially in torsional vortex-induced vibration. To generate this linearity, we develop a simple empirical model of vortex-induced forces. This model accurately reproduces the Griffin plot for a rectangular cylinder using aeroelastic parameters derived from a single Scruton number, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental measurements.</description>
