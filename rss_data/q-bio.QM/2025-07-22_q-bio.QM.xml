      <title>MP-GCAN: a highly accurate classifier for $\alpha$-helical membrane proteins and $\beta$-barrel proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane protein classification is a fundamental task in structural bioinformatics, critical to understanding protein functions and accelerating drug discovery. In this study, we propose MP-GCAN, a novel graph-based classification model that leverages both spatial and sequential features of proteins. MP-GCAN combines GCN, GAT, and GIN layers to capture hierarchical structural representations from 3D protein graphs, constructed from high-resolution PDB files with $\alpha$-carbon coordinates and residue types. To evaluate performance, we curated a high-quality dataset of 500 membrane and 500 non-membrane proteins, and compared MP-GCAN with two baselines: a structure-confidence-based SGD classifier utilizing AlphaFold's pLDDT scores, and DeepTMHMM, a sequence-based deep learning model. Our experiments demonstrate that MP-GCAN significantly outperforms baselines, achieving an accuracy of 96% and strong F1-scores on both classes. The results highlight the importance of integrating pretrained GNN architectures with domain-specific structural data to enhance membrane protein classification.</description>

      <title>KinForm: Kinetics Informed Feature Optimised Representation Models for Enzyme $k_{cat}$ and $K_{M}$ Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic parameters such as the turnover number ($k_{cat}$) and Michaelis constant ($K_{\mathrm{M}}$) are essential for modelling enzymatic activity but experimental data remains limited in scale and diversity. Previous methods for predicting enzyme kinetics typically use mean-pooled residue embeddings from a single protein language model to represent the protein. We present KinForm, a machine learning framework designed to improve predictive accuracy and generalisation for kinetic parameters by optimising protein feature representations. KinForm combines several residue-level embeddings (Evolutionary Scale Modeling Cambrian, Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2, and ProtT5-XL-UniRef50), taken from empirically selected intermediate transformer layers and applies weighted pooling based on per-residue binding-site probability. To counter the resulting high dimensionality, we apply dimensionality reduction using principal--component analysis (PCA) on concatenated protein features, and rebalance the training data via a similarity-based oversampling strategy. KinForm outperforms baseline methods on two benchmark datasets. Improvements are most pronounced in low sequence similarity bins. We observe improvements from binding-site probability pooling, intermediate-layer selection, PCA, and oversampling of low-identity proteins. We also find that removing sequence overlap between folds provides a more realistic evaluation of generalisation and should be the standard over random splitting when benchmarking kinetic prediction models.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation enables label-specific generation of homologous protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately annotating and controlling protein function from sequence data remains a major challenge, particularly within homologous families where annotated sequences are scarce and structural variation is minimal. We present a two-stage approach for semi-supervised functional annotation and conditional sequence generation in protein families using representation learning. First, we demonstrate that protein language models, pretrained on large and diverse sequence datasets and possibly finetuned via contrastive learning, provide embeddings that robustly capture fine-grained functional specificities, even with limited labeled data. Second, we use the inferred annotations to train a generative probabilistic model, an annotation-aware Restricted Boltzmann Machine, capable of producing synthetic sequences with prescribed functional labels. Across several protein families, we show that this approach achieves highly accurate annotation quality and supports the generation of functionally coherent sequences. Our findings underscore the power of combining self-supervised learning with light supervision to overcome data scarcity in protein function prediction and design.</description>

      <title>DUSTrack: Semi-automated point tracking in ultrasound videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases: cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos.

      <title>Systems-Level Analysis of Multisite Protein Phosphorylation: Mathematical Induction, Geometric Series, and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multisite protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular signaling and decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on the mathematical underpinnings and informational aspects of sequential, distributive phosphorylation systems. We first provide rigorous steady-state solutions derived using geometric series arguments and formal mathematical induction, demonstrating that the distribution of phosphorylation states follows a geometric progression determined by the kinase-to-phosphatase activity ratio. We then extend the analysis with entropy-based insights, quantifying uncertainty in phosphorylation states and examining the mutual information between kinase activity and phosphorylation levels through a truncated Poisson model. These results highlight how phosphorylation dynamics introduce both structured patterns and inherent signal variability. By combining exact mathematical proofs with entropy analysis, this work clarifies key quantitative features of multisite phosphorylation from a systems-level perspective.</description>

      <title>TrajLens: Visual Analysis for Constructing Cell Developmental Trajectories in Cross-Sample Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing cell developmental trajectories is a critical task in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, enabling the inference of potential cellular progression paths. However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Using protein blocks to build custom fragment libraries from protein structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable structural diversity of modern proteins reflects millions of years of evolution, during which sequence space has expanded while many structural features remain conserved. This conservation is evident not only among homologous proteins but also in the recurrence of supersecondary motifs across unrelated proteins, underscoring the abundance and robustness of these structural units. Here, we present a novel pipeline for generating customized protein fragment libraries using protein blocks (PBs) - a structural alphabet that encodes local backbone conformations. Our method efficiently extracts structurally similar fragments from a curated, non-redundant protein structure database by converting three-dimensional structures into one-dimensional PB sequences. By integrating predicted PB sequences with the PB-ALIGN and PB-kPRED tools, our approach identifies relevant fragments independently of sequence homology. Fragment quality is further assessed using a new scoring function that combines secondary structure similarity and PB alignment metrics. The resulting libraries contain fragments of at least seven PBs (11 amino acid residues), covering over 70% of the local backbone structure. Our results demonstrate that PBs enable efficient mining of high-quality structural fragments from diverse protein spaces, including proteins with disordered regions. The pipeline is accessible as an online tool (PB-Frag, https://pbpred-us2b.univ-nantes.fr/pbfrag ).</description>

      <title>Leveraging of the IUPAC Names and Machine Learning for Assisting Drug Discovery and Development, demonstrated on the Case of Human Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assist drug developers, this paper presents three computational approaches demonstrated by a PubChem bioassay focused on human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) inhibition. First, a machine learning (ML) model based on the RandomForestClassifier (RFC) algorithm was developed that predicted whether a compound was a TDP1 inhibitor with 70.9% accuracy, 73.1% precision, 66.1% recall, 69.4% F1, and 70.8% ROC. It was trained on 94,712 samples and tested on 28,200. The second approach involved reordering the feature importance list following the relative proportion of active cases, providing insights into the expected effect of certain functional groups/fragments on TDP1 inhibition. The third approach was to identify the most and least desirable functional groups/fragments with respect to TDP1 inhibition. The dataset used for these three approaches was obtained by splitting the IUPAC name`s samples from the bioassay into basic functional groups/fragments. These tokens were then used to name the features (columns) of the dataset that will be used for the mentioned computational approaches. The values in these columns corresponded to the presence (marked with 1) or absence (marked with 0) of this functional group fragment in the relevant sample. Thus, the dataset used in the study has 5,015 columns (features). The labels of this dataset derived from the initial dataset focused on TDP1 inhibition. In addition to the basic study, the CID_SID ML model was developed, which, using only the compound and substance identifier (CID and SID) data from PubChem, could predict with an accuracy of 85.2%, a precision of 94.2%, a precision of 75%, an F1 of 83.5%, and an ROC of 85.2%.</description>

      <title>RetroDiff: Retrosynthesis as Multi-stage Distribution Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis poses a key challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiding chemists in finding appropriate reactant molecules for given product molecules. With reactants and products represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph (G2G) generative task. Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products, then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly, this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis workflow, \emph{i.e.} from reaction center identification to synthon completion. Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular validity, respectively.

      <title>Validation of contact mechanics models for Atomic Force Microscopy via Finite Elements Analysis and nanoindentation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>
