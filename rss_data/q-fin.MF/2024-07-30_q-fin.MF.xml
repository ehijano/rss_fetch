      <title>Optimal retirement in presence of stochastic labor income: a free boundary approach in presence of an incomplete market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how to solve an optimal retirement problem in presence of a stochastic wage dealing with a free boundary problem. In particular, we show how to deal with an incomplete market case, where the wage cannot be fully hedged investing in the risk-free and the risky asset describing the financial market.</description>

      <title>Generative model for financial time series trained with MMD using a signature kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19848v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic financial time series data that accurately reflects real-world market dynamics holds tremendous potential for various applications, including portfolio optimization, risk management, and large scale machine learning. We present an approach for training generative models for financial time series using the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a signature kernel. Our method leverages the expressive power of the signature transform to capture the complex dependencies and temporal structures inherent in financial data. We employ a moving average model to model the variance of the noise input, enhancing the model's ability to reproduce stylized facts such as volatility clustering. Through empirical experiments on S&amp;P 500 index data, we demonstrate that our model effectively captures key characteristics of financial time series and outperforms a comparable GAN-based approach. In addition, we explore the application of the synthetic data generated to train a reinforcement learning agent for portfolio management, achieving promising results. Finally, we propose a method to add robustness to the generative model by tweaking the noise input so that the generated sequences can be adjusted to different market environments with minimal data.</description>

      <title>Consumption-investment optimization with Epstein-Zin utility in unbounded non-Markovian markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates the consumption-investment problem for an investor with Epstein-Zin utility in an incomplete market. A non-Markovian environment with unbounded parameters is considered, which is more realistic in practical financial scenarios compared to the Markovian setting. The optimal consumption and investment strategies are derived using the martingale optimal principle and quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) whose solutions admit some exponential moment. This integrability property plays a crucial role in establishing a key martingale argument. In addition, the paper also examines the associated dual problem and several models within the specified parameter framework.</description>

      <title>Relative Arbitrage Opportunities with Interactions among $N$ Investors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.15158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative arbitrage portfolio outperforms a benchmark portfolio over a given time-horizon with probability one. With market price of risk processes depending on the market portfolio and investors, this paper analyzes the multi-agent optimization of relative arbitrage opportunities in the coupled system of market and wealth dynamics. We construct a well-posed market dynamical system of McKean-Vlasov type under an empirical measure of investors, where each investor seeks for relative arbitrage with respect to a benchmark dependent on market and all the agents. We show the conditions to guarantee relative arbitrage opportunities among competitive investors through the Fichera drift. Under mild conditions, we derive the optimal strategies for investors and the unique Nash equilibrium that depends on the smallest nonnegative solution of a Cauchy problem.</description>
