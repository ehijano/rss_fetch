      <title>Intrinsic compressibility effects in near-wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of intrinsic compressibility effects -- changes in fluid volume due to pressure variations -- on high-speed wall-bounded turbulence has often been overlooked or incorrectly attributed to mean property variations. To unambiguously quantify these intrinsic compressibility effects, we perform direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulent channel flows with nearly uniform mean properties. Our simulations reveal that intrinsic compressibility effects yield a significant upward shift in the logarithmic mean velocity profile that can be attributed to the reduction in the turbulent shear stress. This reduction stems from the weakening of the near-wall quasi-streamwise vortices. We in turn attribute this weakening to the spontaneous opposition of sweeps and ejections from the near-wall expansions and contractions of the fluid, and provide a theoretical explanation for this mechanism. Our results also demonstrate that intrinsic compressibility effects are responsible for the increase in the inner-scaled streamwise turbulence intensity in compressible flows compared to incompressible flows, previously regarded to be an effect of mean property variations.</description>

      <title>Identification of cross-frequency interactions in compressible cavity flow using harmonic resolvent analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolvent analysis reveals the worst-case disturbances and the most amplified response in a fluid flow that can develop around a stationary base state. The recent work by Padovan et al.(2020) extended the classical resolvent analysis to the harmonic resolvent analysis framework by incorporating the time-varying nature of the base flow. The harmonic resolvent analysis can capture the triadic interactions between perturbations at two different frequencies through a base flow at a particular frequency. The singular values of the harmonic resolvent operator act as a gain between the spatio-temporal forcing and the response provided by the singular vectors. In the current study, we formulate the harmonic resolvent analysis framework for compressible flows based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equation (i.e., operator-based formulation). We validate our approach by applying the technique to the low-mach number flow past an airfoil. We further illustrate the application of this method to compressible cavity flows at Mach numbers of 0.6 and 0.8 with a length-to-depth ratio of $2$. For the cavity flow at Mach number of 0.6, the harmonic resolvent analysis reveals that the nonlinear cross-frequency interactions dominate the amplification of perturbations at frequencies that are harmonics of the leading Rossiter mode in the nonlinear flow. The findings demonstrate a physically consistent representation of an energy transfer from slow-evolving modes toward fast-evolving modes in the flow through cross-frequency interactions. For the cavity flow at Mach number of 0.8, the analysis also sheds light on the nature of cross-frequency interaction in a cavity flow with two coexisting resonances.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Surrogate Modeling for Uncertainty Quantification in Complex Slurry Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slurry transportation via pipelines is essential for global industries, offering efficiency and environmental benefits. Specifically, the precise calibration of physical parameters for transporting raw phosphate material to fertilizer plants is crucial to minimize energy losses and ensure secure operations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is commonly employed to understand solid concentration, velocity distributions, and flow pressure along the pipeline. However, numerical solutions for slurry flows often entail uncertainties from initial and boundary conditions, emphasizing the need for quantification. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a framework that combines proper orthogonal decomposition and polynomial chaos expansions to quantify uncertainties in two-dimensional phosphate slurry flow simulations. The use of surrogate modeling methods, like polynomial chaos expansion, proves effective in reducing computational costs associated with direct stochastic simulations, especially for complex flows with high spatial variability, as observed in phosphate slurries. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the non-intrusive reduction method in reproducing mean and variance distributions. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification analysis shows that the reduced-order model significantly reduces computational costs compared to the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Linear stability theory and molecular simulations of nanofilm dewetting with disjoining pressure, strong liquid-solid slip, and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dewetting of thin nanofilms is significantly impacted by thermal fluctuations, liquid-solid slip, and disjoining pressure, which can be described by lubrication equations augmented by appropriately scaled noise terms, known as stochastic lubrication equations. Here molecular dynamics simulations along with a newly proposed slip-generating method are adopted to study the instability of nanofilms with arbitrary slip. These simulations show that strong-slip dewetting is distinct from weak-slip dewetting by faster growth of perturbations and fewer droplets after dewetting, which can not be predicted by the existing stochastic lubrication equation. A new stochastic lubrication equation considering the strong slip boundary condition is thus derived using a long-wave approximation to the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. The linear stability analysis of this equation, i.e., surface spectrum, agrees well with molecular simulations. Interestingly, strong slip can break down the usual Stokes limits adopted in weak-slip dewetting and bring the inertia into effect. The evolution of the standard deviation of the film height $W^2(t)={\overline{h^2}-{\overline{h}}^2}$ at the initial stage of the strong-slip dewetting is found to be $W\sim t^{1/4}$ in contrast to $W\sim t^{1/8}$ for the weak-slip dewetting.</description>

      <title>Wobbling and Migrating Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active components incorporated in materials generate motion by inducing conformational changes in response to external fields. Magnetic fields are particularly interesting as they can actuate materials remotely. Millimeter-sized ferrofluid droplets placed on a solid surface, surrounded by an ambient gas phase, are shown here to migrate under a rotating magnetic field due to the periodic deformation of the liquid-gas interface. This interface wobbling leads to droplet migration with speeds that increase as the amplitude and frequency of the magnetic field increase. In addition to migrating in a controlled manner, we demonstrate the ability of magnetic droplets to clean surface impurities and transport cargo.</description>

      <title>Instability in strongly stratified plane Couette flow with application to supercritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stability of plane Couette flow in the presence of strong density and viscosity stratifications. It demonstrates the existence of a generalised inflection point that satisfies the generalised Fjortoft's criterion of instability when a minimum of kinematic viscosity is present in the base flow. The characteristic scales associated with this minimum are identified as the primary controlling parameters of the associated instability, regardless of the type of stratification. To support this finding, analytical stability models are derived in the long wave approximation using piecewise linear base flows. Numerical stability calculations are carried out to validate these models and to provide further information on the production of disturbance vorticity. All instabilities are interpreted as arising from the interaction between two vorticity waves. Depending on the type of stratification, these two waves are produced by different physical mechanisms. When both strong density and viscosity stratifications are present, we show that they result from the concurrent action of shear and inertial baroclinic effects. The stability models developed for simple fluid models ultimately shed light on a recently observed unstable mode in supercritical fluids (Ren et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 871, 2019, pp. 831-864), providing a quantitative prediction of the stability diagram and identifying the dominant mechanisms at play. Furthermore, our study suggests that the minimum of kinematic viscosity reached at the Widom line in these fluids is the leading cause of their instability. The existence of similar instabilities in different fluids and flows (e.g., miscible fluids) is finally discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of buoyancy induced arrest of viscous coarsening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of buoyant forces on viscous coarsening is studied numerically. It is shown that at any time buoyant forces induce a vertical flow that scales like the Stokes velocity. This does no induce any noticeable change in the morphology of the coarsening microstructure under a value of the characteristic length of the pattern. Above this threshold the pattern evolves toward a quasi two D pattern and coarsening stops. The characteristic length is shown to scale like $\sqrt{\gamma/(g \Delta\rho)}$ where $\gamma$ is he surface tension and $\Delta\rho$ the mass dnsiy difference between the phases.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modulation in dense liquid-solid channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which inertial solid particles modulate turbulence and alter the fluid mass transport in dense turbulent liquid-solid flows. To this end, we perform Euler-Lagrange simulations at friction Reynolds number 180, particle friction Stokes number 7.9, particle-to-fluid density ratio 8.9, and particle volume fraction ranging from 1% up to 12%. We show that the mechanisms underpinning the flow modulation are two fold: (I) the increase of the suspension's apparent kinematic viscosity with increasing solid volume fraction and (II) turbulence modulation through the particle feedback force. For solid volume fraction below 3%, the increase of the suspension's apparent kinematic viscosity by the disperse particles accounts for most of the flow modification, namely, the reduction of turbulent fluctuations, reduction of the bulk fluid velocity, and increase of friction coefficient. In denser channels, the particle feedback force leads to greater reduction of bulk fluid velocity and increase of friction coefficient than can be accounted for solely based on the increased apparent kinematic viscosity. In these cases, particle stress significantly alters the stress balance, to a point where it exceeds the Reynolds stress at solid volume fraction 12%.</description>

      <title>A face-centred finite volume method for laminar and turbulent incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops, for the first time, a face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver for the simulation of laminar and turbulent viscous incompressible flows. The formulation relies on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the negative Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and three novel convective stabilisations, inspired by Riemann solvers, are derived and compared numerically. The resulting method achieves first-order convergence of the velocity, the velocity-gradient tensor and the pressure. FCFV accurately predicts engineering quantities of interest, such as drag and lift, on unstructured meshes and, by avoiding gradient reconstruction, the method is less sensitive to mesh quality than other FV methods, even in the presence of highly distorted and stretched cells. A monolithic and a staggered solution strategies for the RANS-SA system are derived and compared numerically. Numerical benchmarks, involving laminar and turbulent, steady and transient cases are used to assess the performance, accuracy and robustness of the proposed FCFV method.</description>

      <title>Equatorial blowup and polar caps in drop electrohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illuminate effects of surface-charge convection intrinsic to leaky-dielectric electrohydrodynamics by analyzing the symmetric steady state of a circular drop in an external field at arbitrary electric Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_E$. In formulating the problem, we identify an exact factorization that reduces the number of dimensionless parameters from four -- $\mathrm{Re}_E$ and the conductivity, permittivity and viscosity ratios -- to two: a modified electric Reynolds number $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ and a charging parameter $\varpi$. In the case $\varpi&lt;0$, where charge relaxation in the drop phase is slower than in the suspending phase, and, as a consequence, the interface polarizes antiparallel to the external field, we find that above a critical $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ value the solution exhibits a blowup singularity such that the surface-charge density diverges antisymmetrically with the $-1/3$ power of distance from the equator. We use local analysis to uncover the structure of that blowup singularity, wherein surface charges are convected by a locally induced flow towards the equator where they annihilate. To study the blowup regime, we devise a numerical scheme encoding that local structure where the blowup prefactor is determined by a global charging -- annihilation balance. We also employ asymptotic analysis to construct a universal problem governing the blowup solutions in the regime $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}\gg1$, far beyond the blowup threshold. In the case $\varpi&gt;0$, where charge relaxation is faster in the drop phase and the interface polarizes parallel to the external field, we numerically observe and asymptotically characterize the formation at large $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ of stagnant, perfectly conducting surface-charge caps about the drop poles.</description>

      <title>Detection of Quantized Vortices using Fourth Sound Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium confined to nanofluidic systems is emerging as an important system for studies of two-dimensional turbulence and as the basis for novel quantum technologies. In fully enclosed nanofluidic geometries only the fourth sound can propagate, which we show can be used for probing quantized vortices pinned in well-defined slab geometry. We show that similarly to well-established second sound attenuation, fourth sound attenuation can be used to infer the number of quantized vortices in a unit area. We experimentally verify fourth sound attenuation as a probe of vortex line density by injecting a known number of quantized vortices into a nanofluidic slab using a rotating cryostat.</description>
