Abstract: This study is a continuation of previous work, which highlights the nutrient enhancement by using rice straw (RS) and pressmud (PM) on vermicomposting. Herein, we demonstrate the significant impact of Moringa oleifera derived Cu/Ni/Co oxide nanoparticles (TmONs) in conjunction with these vermicompost on the growth performance of Abelmoschus esculentus. Vermicompost produced under various combinations (T0, cow dung (CD) only; T1, 1CD:1RS; T2, 1CD:1PM, and T3, 1CD:1RS:1PM) were further enriched by blending with biogenic nanoparticles. This strategic combination enhances the nutritional composition of the vermicompost, contributing to its overall effectiveness in promoting plant growth and health. Various analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, XPS, FESEM-EDX, TEM, and ICP-OES, were employed for comprehensive characterization. The synthesized TmONs with sizes ranging from 13 to 54 nm exhibited distinct CuO, NiO, and CoO phases. The vermicompost blended TmONs demonstrated significant improvements (P &lt; 0.05) in seed germination (167%), coefficient velocity (67%), and vigour index (95%), while reducing the mean germination time by 41% for A. esculentus compared to the control group. The plant culture group nT3 (T3 + TmONs) showed the best growth performance. Furthermore, trace element concentrations in both soil and plant leaves were found to be below the maximum permissible limits set by WHO (1996). This investigation extends the understanding of the role played by these nanoparticles in fostering optimal conditions for plant growth and development as these micronutrients are essential components for several plant enzymes.</description>
