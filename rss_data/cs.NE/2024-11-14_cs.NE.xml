      <title>Evolutionary Algorithm with Detection Region Method for Constrained Multi-Objective Problems with Binary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) is a challenging task. While many practical algorithms have been developed to tackle CMOPs, real-world scenarios often present cases where the constraint functions are unknown or unquantifiable, resulting in only binary outcomes (feasible or infeasible). This limitation reduces the effectiveness of constraint violation guidance, which can negatively impact the performance of existing algorithms that rely on this approach. Such challenges are particularly detrimental for algorithms employing the epsilon-based method, as they hinder effective relaxation of the feasible region. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called DRMCMO based on the detection region method. In DRMCMO, detection regions dynamic monitor feasible solutions to enhance convergence, helping the population escape local optima. Additionally, these regions collaborate with the neighbor pairing strategy to improve population diversity within narrow feasible areas. We have modified three existing test suites to serve as benchmark test problems for CMOPs with binary constraints(CMOP/BC) and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms on these test suites and real-world problems. The results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of DRMCMO against state-of-the-art algorithms. Given the limited research on CMOP/BC, our study offers a new perspective for advancing this field.</description>

      <title>New advances in universal approximation with neural networks of minimal width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in diverse applications, prompting the need for a solid theoretical foundation. Recent research has identified the minimal width $\max\{2,d_x,d_y\}$ required for neural networks with input dimensions $d_x$ and output dimension $d_y$ that use leaky ReLU activations to universally approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta. Here, we present an alternative proof for the minimal width of such neural networks, by directly constructing approximating networks using a coding scheme that leverages the properties of leaky ReLUs and standard $L^p$ results. The obtained construction has a minimal interior dimension of $1$, independent of input and output dimensions, which allows us to show that autoencoders with leaky ReLU activations are universal approximators of $L^p$ functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalizing flow LU-Net serves as a distributional universal approximator. We broaden our results to show that smooth invertible neural networks can approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R}^{d})$ on compacta when the dimension $d\geq 2$, which provides a constructive proof of a classical theorem of Brenier and Gangbo. In addition, we use a topological argument to establish that for FNNs with monotone Lipschitz continuous activations, $d_x+1$ is a lower bound on the minimal width required for the uniform universal approximation of continuous functions $C^0(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta when $d_x\geq d_y$.</description>

      <title>Reducing ADC Front-end Costs During Training of On-sensor Printed Multilayer Perceptrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.</description>

      <title>Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models with Gradient Flow: Time Complexity and Directional Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \!=\! \sum_{j=1}^k \! \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for the single-index case ($k\!=\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \! \asymp \! k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T v_j \!=\! \beta \! \geq \! 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c \!=\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.</description>

      <title>An accelerate Prediction Strategy for Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) by introducing novel approaches for accelerating prediction strategies within the evolutionary algorithm framework. Since the objectives of DMOPs evolve over time, both the Pareto optimal set (PS) and the Pareto optimal front (PF) are dynamic. To effectively track the changes in the PS and PF in both decision and objective spaces, we propose an adaptive prediction strategy that incorporates second-order derivatives to predict and adjust the algorithms search behavior. This strategy enhances the algorithm's ability to anticipate changes in the environment, allowing for more efficient population re-initialization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method against four state-of-the-art algorithms using standard DMOPs benchmark problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the other algorithms across most test problems.</description>

      <title>Automated Placement of Analog Integrated Circuits using Priority-based Constructive Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic approach for solving the placement of Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits. Placement is a crucial step in the physical design of integrated circuits. During this step, designers choose the position and variant of each circuit device. We focus on the specific class of analog placement, which requires so-called pockets, their possible merging, and parametrizable minimum distances between devices, which are features mostly omitted in recent research and literature. We formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming and propose a priority-based constructive heuristic inspired by algorithms for the Facility Layout Problem. Our solution minimizes the perimeter of the circuit's bounding box and the approximated wire length. Multiple variants of the devices with different dimensions are considered. Furthermore, we model constraints crucial for the placement problem, such as symmetry groups and blockage areas. Our outlined improvements make the heuristic suitable to handle complex rules of placement. With a search guided either by a Genetic Algorithm or a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we show the quality of the proposed method on both synthetically generated and real-life industrial instances accompanied by manually created designs. Furthermore, we apply reinforcement learning to control the hyper-parameters of the genetic algorithm. Synthetic instances with more than 200 devices demonstrate that our method can tackle problems more complex than typical industry examples. We also compare our method with results achieved by contemporary state-of-the-art methods on the MCNC and GSRC datasets.</description>

      <title>TreeC: a method to generate interpretable energy management systems using a metaheuristic algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy management systems (EMS) have traditionally been implemented using rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) methods. However, recent research has explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising alternative. This paper introduces TreeC, a machine learning method that utilizes the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy metaheuristic algorithm to generate an interpretable EMS modeled as a decision tree. Unlike RBC and MPC approaches, TreeC learns the decision strategy of the EMS based on historical data, adapting the control model to the controlled energy grid. The decision strategy is represented as a decision tree, providing interpretability compared to RL methods that often rely on black-box models like neural networks. TreeC is evaluated against MPC with perfect forecast and RL EMSs in two case studies taken from literature: an electric grid case and a household heating case. In the electric grid case, TreeC achieves an average energy loss and constraint violation score of 19.2, which is close to MPC and RL EMSs that achieve scores of 14.4 and 16.2 respectively. All three methods control the electric grid well especially when compared to the random EMS, which obtains an average score of 12 875. In the household heating case, TreeC performs similarly to MPC on the adjusted and averaged electricity cost and total discomfort (0.033 EUR/m$^2$ and 0.42 Kh for TreeC compared to 0.037 EUR/m$^2$ and 2.91 kH for MPC), while outperforming RL (0.266 EUR/m$^2$ and 24.41 Kh).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in inverse problems, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. Our results establish that our proposed GradNet (and mGradNet) universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of potential functions, including transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results demonstrate that these architectures provide efficient parameterizations and outperform existing methods by up to 15 dB in gradient field tasks and by up to 11 dB in Hamiltonian dynamics learning tasks.</description>
