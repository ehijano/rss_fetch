      <title>Phase Matching of Orbital Angular Momentum in Rare Earth Ion Doped Solid State Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the generation of stimulated photon echos carrying unique topological charge that results from the temporal phase matching conditions of three independent beams spatially and spectrally overlapped in a cryogenically cooled rare earth ion doped solid state system. A sample of $Tm^{3+}:YAG$ was used to generalize the momentum phase matching condition to include the orbital angular momentum of the input fields. The input fields and corresponding photon echo were characterized via astigmatic transform, with results mapping directly to the expected behavior of traditional stimulated photon echos. These results demonstrate that rare earth ion doped systems are capable of spatial multiplexing, spatial filtering, and the generation of structured light, opening pathways towards real time optical multi-modal signal processing.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Wave Scattering via Coincidences of Complex Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a theoretical framework for coherent control of multichannel scattering of linear waves to route waves through complex geometries with multiple scattering. We show that steady-state perfect routing solutions are achievable at any frequency via tuning geometric param- eters so that multiple complex eigenfrequencies coincide on the real axis. The relevant complex spectra describe critically constrained scattering processes (CCONs), where a specific number of generically accessible outgoing channels are not excited due to destructive interference. Focusing on electromagnetic waves, we demonstrate in simulations high discrimination routing and demulti- plexing of signals in a multiport chaotic cavity with a number of tunable scatterers which can be predicted from theory. A similar approach can be used to implement other interesting functional- ities, such as filtering, power division and directional lasing. The method can be applied to other classical waves and also to quantum matter waves.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Nonlinear Optical Tomography: Unbiased Characterization of Off- and On-Chip Coupling Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Perfect Heat Rectification and Circulation with Nonreciprocal Radiative Surfaces in the Far Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling photon mediated energy flow is central to the future of communications, thermal management, and energy harvesting technologies. Recent breakthroughs have revealed that many body systems violating Lorentz reciprocity can sustain persistent photon heat current at thermal equilibrium, hinting at a new paradigm of heat flow akin to superconductivity. Yet, the behavior of such systems far from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. In this work, we uncover the rich physics of radiative heat transfer in nonequilibrium, far field many body systems composed of thermal emitters that break Lorentz reciprocity. We show that the total heat flow naturally decomposes into two distinct components: an equilibrium term, which generates a persistent circulating heat current within the system, and a nonequilibrium term, which governs energy exchange with the environment. Remarkably, while the internal persistent heat current is ever present, the nonequilibrium contribution can be precisely engineered to achieve perfect heat rectification and circulation. Our results open a new route toward designing thermal systems with unprecedented control unlocking the potential for lossless heat circulation and one way thermal devices. This fundamentally shifts the landscape for next generation thermal logic, energy conversion, and photonic heat engines.</description>

      <title>Scalable Generalized Meta-Spanners Enabling Parallel Multitasking Optical Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical manipulation techniques offer exceptional contactless control but are fundamentally limited in their ability to perform parallel multitasking. To achieve high-density, versatile manipulation with subwavelength photonic devices, it is essential to sculpt light fields in multiple dimensions. Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing generalized optical meta-spanners (GOMSs) based on metasurfaces. Relying on complex-amplitude modulation, this platform generates lens-free, customizable optical fields that suppress diffractive losses. As a result, several advanced functionalities are simultaneously achieved, including longitudinally varying manipulation and in-plane spanner arrays, which outperforms the same operations realized by conventional donut-shaped orbital flows. Furthermore, the particle dynamics is reconfigurable simply by switching the input and output polarizations, facilitating robust multi-channel control. We experimentally validate the proposed approach by demonstrating single-particle dynamics and the parallel manipulation of particle ensembles, revealing exceptional stability for multitasking operations. These results demonstrate an ultracompact platform scalable to a much larger number of optical spanners, advancing metadevices from wavefront sculptors to particle manipulators. We envision that the GOMS will catalyze innovations in cross-disciplinary fields such as targeted drug delivery and cell-level biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Phase stabilization for long baseline interferometry of incoherent optical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum baseline, and therefore resolution, of optical astronomical interferometers is limited by attenuation and phase noise within the optical path between the apertures and beam combiner, as well as the practical challenges of constructing optical delay lines more than a few hundred meters in length. We implement off-band phase stabilization on two fiber optic links of 85 km, creating a total baseline of 170 km. We show that the system is able to effectively phase stabilize signals from an incoherent pseudo-thermal source with a bandwidth of 11.2 nm. We are able to reduce the phase noise of a fiber based interferometer with two 85 km arms by 4-5 orders of magnitude between 1 and 100 Hz such that we could resolve an applied phase shift sweep of 0.16 cycles per second with continuous measurement. We show that, with phase stabilization active, the interferometer is able to recover both first-order and second-order photon correlations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for long-baseline optical and quantum astronomical interferometers. The present results are limited by chromatic dispersion within the fiber, which can be mitigated using dispersion compensating modules.</description>

      <title>Generative model for information metamaterial design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models such as AlphaFold and MatterGen can directly generate novel material structures with desired properties, accelerating the new materials discovery and revolutionizing the material design paradigm from traditional trial-and-error approach to intelligent on-demand generation. AlphaFold is focused on protein prediction with specific aperiodic structures; while MatterGen is focused on predicting periodic and stable crystal structures. The universal design of metamaterials is much more complicated, since it involves to design meta-atoms (similar to the periodic structures) and their arbitrarily inhomogeneous distributions in space. Here, we propose InfoMetaGen, a universal generative model for information metamaterial design, which combines a pre-trained foundation model with lightweight functional adapters to intelligently generate artificial structures on-demand spanning from meta-atoms to arbitrary space coding patterns. In contrast to conventional intelligent metamaterial design methods that require training dedicated models for specific functionalities, InfoMetaGen enables a single universal generative model capable of switching across diverse functionalities by fine-tuning the lightweight adapters, significantly improving both efficiency and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that InfoMetaGen can not only accelerate the diverse discovery of new metamaterials, but also achieve breakthroughs in metamaterial performance. This work fills the gap of universal generative framework in designing artificial materials, and opens up unprecedented opportunities to expand the capability of generative models from the passive discovery of microscopic natural material to the active creation of macroscopic artificial materials.</description>

      <title>Strong- vs weak-coupling lasing in polymer-film microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are particularly attractive for polaritonics due to their large exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths. Among them, the ladder-type conjugated polymer poly(paraphenylene) (MeLPPP) is distinguished by its rigid backbone, narrow exciton linewidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced photostability, which makes it an excellent candidate for organic polariton devices. While polariton lasing has been reported in various organic systems, systematic studies of the transition from polariton lasing to conventional photon lasing within a single, well-controlled material platform remain limited. Understanding this crossover is crucial for distinguishing polariton-specific signatures from conventional lasing. Here, we present planar organic microcavities incorporating MeLPPP as the active medium that supports polariton lasing. By tuning the effective cavity length, we track the transition from strong to weak coupling and identify its impact on the lasing behaviour. Our results reveal a many fold increase in the lasing threshold when moving from polariton to photon lasing, emission energy pulling towards the polymer gain maximum for either regimes, and an important role of vibron mediated exciton relaxation evidenced by the reduction in lasing thresholds near vibron energy resonances with respect to the S10 exciton. These findings provide fundamental insight into light-matter coupling in organics and highlight MeLPPP microcavities as a versatile platform for future applications in low-threshold lasers.</description>

      <title>High Bandwidth and Ultra-low Dark Current Ge Photodetector Enabled by Frequency Domain Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High bandwidth and low dark current germanium (Ge) photodetectors are crucial in silicon photonic integrated circuits. The bandwidth of Ge photodetectors is restricted by carrier transit time and parasitic parameters. And thermal generation of carriers within the Ge P-N junction results in an inherent dark current, typically in nA-{\mu}A range. Here, we propose an equalization photodetector (EqPD) utilizing the frequency response of a high-bandwidth photodetector PDA to subtract the frequency response of a low-bandwidth photodetector PDB. With the response of PDB attenuating more severely than PDA at high frequency, the differential response (the response of EqPD) can get higher values at high-frequency than at low-frequency. The dark current of EqPD can also be significantly reduced with PDB balancing the dark current of PDA. Experimental results show that the bandwidth of our proposed photodetector can be expanded to over 110 GHz with a dark current of 1 pA simultaneously, and its Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) transmission speed can reach 100 Gbaud without digital signal processing. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest bandwidth and lowest dark current in a vertical Ge photodetector. The high-performance EqPD provides a promising solution for high-speed and ultra-low noise photodetection in next-generation optical communication.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Holographic Agglutination Assay for Immunoglobulin A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a Holographic Agglutination Assay for quantifying levels of the immunoglobulin protein IgA in biological samples. This is the first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective agglutination.
  By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 {\mu}M) to high (320 mg/dL, 20 {\mu}M) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing IgA from samples containing IgG.
  More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.</description>

      <title>Unveiling spin-orbital angular momentum locking in photonic Dirac vortex cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac vortices, originally studied in quantum field theories to predict localized zero-energy modes, were recently realized in photonics, leading to Dirac vortex cavities. With topological protection, Dirac vortex cavities offer robust single-mode large-area localized modes appealing for high-performance micro-lasers and other applications. As a spectrally-isolated single mode, the radiation of a Dirac vortex cavity mode was believed as having vanishing orbital angular momentum due to time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the direct observation of orbital angular momentum radiation of a Dirac vortex cavity through spin-resolved measurements. Remarkably, we confirm the spin-orbital angular momentum locking in such radiation due to the spin-valley locking and inter-valley couplings. We demonstrate that the spin-orbital angular momentum locking is controlled by the chirality of the Kekul\'e modulation and propose design schemes for arbitrary-order single-mode OAM radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the measurement of thermal photon statistics from a semiconductor photon Bose-Einstein condensate operating just above the condensation threshold. We identify a regime where coherent, single mode emission occurs while still demonstrating significant photon bunching. Taking advantage of the photon bunching, along with the continuous-wave operation and high photon flux, we demonstrate optical range sensing using a photon Bose-Einstein condensate. We characterise the precision of the range measurement and analyse the dependence on the condensate's pump power and resulting coherence properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic-Photonic Interface for Multiuser Optical Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an electronic-photonic (EP) interface for multiuser optical wireless communication (OWC), consisting of a multibeam optical phased array (MBOPA) along with co-integrated electro-optic (EO) modulators and high-speed CMOS drivers. The MBOPA leverages a path-length difference in the optical phased array (OPA) along with wavelength-division multiplexing technology for spatial carrier aggregation and multiplexing. To generate two and four pulsed amplitude modulation signals, and transmit them to multiple users, we employ an optical digital-to-analog converter technique by using two traveling-wave electrode Mach-Zehnder modulators, which are monolithically integrated with high-speed, wide-output-swing CMOS drivers. The MBOPA and monolithic EO modulator are implemented by silica wafer through planar lightwave circuit fabrication process and a 45-nm monolithic silicon photonics technology, respectively. We measured and analyzed two-channel parallel communication at a data rate of 54 Gbps per user over the wireless distance of 1 m. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system level demonstration of the multi-user OWC using the in-house-designed photonic and monolithically integrated chips. Finally, we suggest best modulation format for different data rate and the number of multibeams, considering effects of the proposed OPA and the monolithic modulator.</description>

      <title>Coupled electric dipole model for a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of optically resonant coreshell nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coreshell nanoparticles can combine optical features of different materials in a single nanostructure, which makes them interesting for many applications from biomedicine to energy harvesting. On the other hand, periodic arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles can exhibit topological phenomena such as topological edge states. Here we study periodic chains of Si@Ag coreshell nanoparticles. For this task, we combine the hybridization of surface plasmonic modes in complex nanostructures with the coupled electric dipole formalism employed for modelling the scattering of light by periodic arrays of small plasmonic nanoparticles. We propose treating coreshell nanoparticle as several coupled electric dipoles instead of just one and show how this is a more appropriate framework to study arrays of coreshell nanoparticles, which allows to build a one-to-one connection between the resonant modes of the nanoparticles and the dispersion bands of the system. Within this formalism, we show that a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of coreshell Si@Ag nanoparticles host multiple topological edge states pinned at the resonant frequencies of the coreshell nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Coherent absorption reveals colors hidden in a grey Fabry-P\'erot cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin dielectric films are known to show distinct colors, responsible for the iridescence of various natural and artificial objects such as insect wings and soap bubbles. In the present article we show that a specialized thin film Fabry-P\'erot resonator, that we name conductor-dielectric-conductor (CDC) matched cavity, appears instead completely grey when observed under ordinary conditions (i.e. by analyzing the transmitted or reflected incoherent white light). Nonetheless, the matched CDC cavity still retains spectral information, that clearly appear when the cavity is analyzed by the coherent absorption technique. The CDC system is simply a dielectric thin film sandwiched by two conducting interfaces, whose conductivity shall be appropriately matched depending upon the dielectric refractive index. In practical applications, the ideal conducting interfaces can be safely replaced by thin metal films, making the system easily applicable in particular for cryptographic purposes. We indeed demonstrated experimentally that a visually recognizable thin-film color pattern can be concealed to an ordinary observer, and finally recovered through a dedicated coherent absorption decoding apparatus.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator in a non-closed waveguide path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are foundational for versatile applications, where high-performance traveling-wave optical resonators are critical. Conventional whispering-gallery mode microresonators (WGMRs) confine light in closed-loop waveguide paths, thus inevitably occupy large footprints. Here, we report an ultracompact high loaded Q silicon photonic WGMR in an open curved path instead. By leveraging spatial mode multiplexing, low-loss mode converter-based photonic routers enable reentrant photon recycling in a single non-closed waveguide. The fabricated device achieves a measured loaded Q-factor of 1.78*10^5 at 1554.3 nm with a 1.05 nm free spectral range in a ultracompact footprint of 0.00137 mm^2-6*smaller than standard WGMRs while delivering 100*higher Q-factor than photonic crystal counterparts. This work pioneers dense integration of high-performance WGMR arrays through open-path mode recirculation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution in the Iberian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising use of quantum networking is quantum key distribution (QKD), which can provide information-theoretic security unattainable by classical means. While optical fiber-based QKD networks suffer from exponential loss, satellite-assisted quantum communication offers a scalable solution for long-distance secure key exchange. In this work, we propose and evaluate a satellite-based QKD setup covering the Iberian Peninsula, linking Madrid with Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Our proposed setup uses a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) state-of-the-art satellite equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source to distribute entangled photon pairs to ground stations. Considering vibrations in the satellite, we optimize the beam waist to enhance the transmission probability and improve the secret key rate (SKR). Our results show that key rates sufficient for real-world applications, such as secure communication between hospitals, using hybrid classical-quantum protocols are feasible with existing protocols. Our results highlight the viability of near-term satellite-based QKD networks for national-scale secure communications.</description>

      <title>Angular Emission Properties of Strained Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides have shown that uniaxial strain changes both the photoluminescence emission energy and intensity. The changes are attributed to the band-structure evolution under tensile strain where both the bandgap decreases and a direct-to-indirect transition occurs. This was shown for relatively high strains, whereas this is not the case at low strain values $&lt;1\%$ in which in this work, we observe the erratic dependency of the photoluminescence intensity at low strain values as a function of strain. We find that the dominant physical property is the dependence of the optical-dipole emission on the curvature of the substrate. We validate the behavior of the photoluminescence intensity with experimental angular emission spectroscopy (k-space imaging). These findings are supported by Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, in agreement with the experimental data. Our findings present the importance of choosing the right substrate for flexible devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Aperture Masking Interferometric Imaging: Demonstration with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\mu$m and 3.8~$\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\%.</description>

      <title>Exact dynamics and qubit inversion of non-Hermitian driven two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersymmetric structure of a generalized non-Hermitian driven two-level system is demonstrated. A unitary rotation turns the Hamiltonian into a more convenient form. After decoupling a set of differential equations, the supersymmetric structure of the problem can be unequivocally ap- appreciated. Performing a spectral analysis of an auxiliary stationary Schr\"odinger-like equation, complex time-dependent driving functions are obtained for which the corresponding (time-dependent) Schr\"odinger equation can be straightforwardly solved. Such complex drivings are seen to produce transitions in the qubit state in different, however interesting, manners. We believe that the results reported here will be of interest for designing and carrying out various experiments in laboratories specializing in nuclear magnetic resonance or in optics with gain and loss materials.</description>

      <title>Robust Superradiance and Spontaneous Spin Ordering in Disordered Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective emission of a disordered array of $N$ excited two-level atoms into a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. In the perfectly ordered case, where atoms are spaced by exact integer multiples of the wavelength, the system exhibits the characteristic superradiant burst with a peak emission rate scaling as $N^2$. Using large-scale semiclassical simulations, we find that this key signature of superradiance remains asymptotically robust under strong spatial and spectral disorder, but also exhibits subtle finite-size scaling toward this limit. To explain our observations, we provide an analytical variational estimate for the maximal decay rate, which tightly bounds the numerical results and reveals how disorder shapes the collective decay. Specifically, we find that even in the presence of strong disorder, the spins tend to self-organize spontaneously according to their locations, which overall optimizes constructive interference effects and explains the emergence of mirror-asymmetric correlations in superradiant decay. These findings resolve important open questions regarding the existence and nature of superradiance in strongly disordered arrays and offer valuable insights for understanding collective quantum optical phenomena in realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Response of Graphene Quantum Dots in the Visible Spectrum: A Combined DFT-QED Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) to study the dynamical characteristics of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). We assume the GQD edges are saturated with hydrogen atoms, effectively making it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as coronene. By combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with the dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main optical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the dipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the population dynamics of the molecular levels. Owing to the close match between the calculated spectrum and experimental results, our results represent a significant contribution to research on quantum treatments of light-matter interactions in realistic 2D nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric chirp transfer in high-energy ultraviolet via four-wave mixing in gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customizing the pulse shaping of femtosecond pulses remains a key challenge in ultrafast optics. Programmable shaping for high-power ultraviolet (UV) pulses is constrained by the transmission properties and damage threshold of the dielectric materials used. As a stepping stone toward overcoming this broad challenge, we demonstrate an anti-symmetric dispersion transfer from near-infrared (NIR) pulses to UV pulses through chirped-four-wave-mixing (CFWM) in argon gas. Nagatively chirped NIR pulses map quasi-linearly to positively chirped UV in a gas-filled hollow capillary fiber (HCF), achieving a conversion efficiency exceeding 13% at 0.61 bar. This approach expands the foundations of UV pulse shaping, enabling broadband frequency conversion by leveraging the large acceptance angle and intrinsically low dispersion of noble gases, rather than relying on conventional nonlinear crystals. Spectro-temporally customizing high-energy, ultrashort UV pulses is a pivotal technique for applications in ultrafast dynamics, high-precision spectroscopy, strong field physics, charged-particle and radiation sources, and industrial microfabrication.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Non-destructive sub-surface inspection of multi-layer wind turbine blade coatings by mid-infrared Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-destructive inspection (NDI) is useful in the industrial sector to ensure that manufacturing follows defined specifications, reducing the quantity of waste and thereby the cost of production. In response to climate change and the need to reduce carbon footprints, there is a growing demand for NDI solutions that are primarily non-contact, as well as non-destructive, fast, and easily integrated. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a well-known diagnostic technique in medical and biological research, is increasingly being used for industrial NDI. In the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, OCT can be used to characterise parts and defects not possible by other industry-ready scanners, and enables better penetration than conventional near-infrared OCT.
  In this article, we demonstrate NDI of wind turbine blade (WTB) coatings using an MIR OCT scanner employing light around 4 $\mu$m from a supercontinuum source. We inspected the top two layers of the coating (topcoat and primer) in two different samples. The first is to determine the maximum penetration depth, and the second one is to emulate defect identification. The results of our study confirm that MIR OCT scanners are highly suitable for coating inspection and quality control in the production of WTBs, with performance parameters not achievable by other technologies.</description>

Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

      <title>Light coupling to photonic integrated circuits using optimized lensed fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable light coupling between optical fibers and photonic integrated circuits has arguably been the most essential issue in integrated photonics for optical interconnects, nonlinear signal conversion, neuromorphic computing, and quantum information processing. A commonly used approach is to use inverse tapers interfacing with lensed fibers, particularly for waveguides of relatively low refractive index, such as silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxynitride, and lithium niobate. This approach simultaneously enables broad operation bandwidth, high coupling efficiency, and simplified fabrication. Although diverse taper designs have been invented and characterized to date, lensed fibers play equally important roles here, yet their optimization has long been underexplored. Here, we fill this gap and introduce a comprehensive co-optimization strategy that synergistically refines the geometries of the taper and the lensed fiber. By incorporating the genuine lensed fiber's shape into the simulation, we accurately capture its non-Gaussian emission profile, thereby nullifying the widely accepted approximation based on a paraxial Gaussian mode. We further characterize many lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers of varying shapes using different fabrication processes. Our experimental and simulation results show remarkable agreement, both achieving maximum coupling efficiencies exceeding 80% per facet. Finally, we summarize the optimal choices of lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers that can be directly deployed in modern CMOS foundries for scalable manufacturing of Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. Our study not only contributes to light-coupling solutions but is also critical for photonic packaging and optoelectronic assemblies that are currently revolutionizing data centers and AI.</description>

      <title>Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>
