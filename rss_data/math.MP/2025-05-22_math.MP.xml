      <title>Exact spin helix eigenstates in anisotropic spin-$s$ Heisenberg model in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-helix states are exact eigenstates of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ Heisenberg chain characterized by spatially modulated spin textures appearing under special parameter conditions. In this work, we generalize this framework and construct exact spin helix eigenstates in the fully anisotropic XYZ Heisenberg model, extending to higher spatial dimensions and spin representations, which reveals new stabilization mechanisms beyond integrability. The XXZ and XY limits are also analyzed to clarify the properties and constraints of these spin helix eigenstates. Our results broaden the class of analytically tractable exact eigenstates in quantum spin systems and deepen understanding of spatially inhomogeneous states in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Gap modes in Arnold tongues and their topological origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gap modes in a modified Mathieu equation, perturbed by a Dirac delta potential, are investigated. It is proved that the modified Mathieu equation admits stable isolated gap modes with topological origins in the unstable regions of the Mathieu equation, which are known as Arnold tongues. The modes may be identified as localized electron wavefunctions in a 1D chain or as toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes. A generalization of this argument shows that gap modes can be induced in regimes of instability by localized potential perturbations for a large class of periodic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian reductions, scalings, and effective wave models in stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Poisson reduction techniques to describe asymptotic fully nonlinear models of fluid wave motion in the Hamiltonian setting. We start by considering Zakharov and Benjamin Hamiltonian settings for a stably stratified $2D$ Euler fluid. We use a Marsden-Ratiu reduction scheme for sharply stratified fluids to obtain a canonical formulation of the stratified effective model in one space variable. The long-wave Serre-Green Naghdi (SGN) equations is then recovered by means of a suitable double scaling limit in the Hamiltonian function. We also consider the opposite double-scaling limit, which leads to a local model in the "large-lower layer" regime. Furthermore, applying the previous results on the canonical structure of the SGN equations, we provide the Miyata-Choi Camassa (CC) equations for fully non-linear waves in sharply stratified fluids with a natural Hamiltonian structure. We also study the reduced Hamiltonian system obtained taking the natural constraints of the CC equations into account. To this end, we perform a Dirac-type reduction on a suitable constrained submanifold of fluid field configurations.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on large deviations in non-equilibrium diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are a written version of lectures given in the 2024 Les Houches Summer School on {\it Large deviations and applications}. They are are based on a series of works published over the last 25 years on steady properties of non-equilibrium systems in contact with several heat baths at different temperatures or several reservoirs of particles at different densities. After recalling some classical tools to study non-equilibrium steady states, such as the use of tilted matrices, the Fluctuation theorem, the determination of transport coefficients, the Einstein relations or fluctuating hydrodynamics, they describe some of the basic ideas of the macroscopic fluctuation theory allowing to determine the large deviation functions of the density and of the current of diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Explicit isomorphisms for the symmetry algebras of continuous and discrete isotropic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of a parametric Lie algebra encompassing the symmetry algebras of the isotropic oscillator (for positive, purely imaginary and zero frequency) and one of its possible deformations. We show that such a Lie algebra appears naturally also within the context of maximally superintegrable discretizations of the isotropic harmonic oscillator. After an in-depth analysis of the properties characterizing the Lie algebra in the purely abstract setting, we construct explicit isomorphism maps to the $\mathfrak{u}_N$, $\mathfrak{gl}_N(\mathbb{R})$, and a semidirect sum of $\mathfrak{so}_N (\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathbb{R}^{N(N+1)/2}$ in $N$ dimensions, respectively. Additionally, we also show that the isotropic harmonic oscillator and one of its discretizations admits a Nambu-Hamiltonian structure.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Sutherland system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this first of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply-connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$. As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative. When the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$. Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns. For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

      <title>On quantitative linear gravitational relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay rates for the linearised Vlasov-Poisson system around compactly supported equilibria. More precisely, we prove decay of the gravitational potential induced by the radial dynamics of this system in the presence of a point mass source. Our result can be interpreted as the gravitational version of linear Landau damping in the radial setting and hence the first linear asymptotic stability result around such equilibria. We face fundamental obstacles to decay caused by the presence of stable trapping in the problem. To overcome these issues we introduce several new ideas. We use different tools, including the Birkhoff-Poincar\'e normal form, action-angle type variables, and delicate resolvent bounds to prove a suitable version of the limiting absorption principle and obtain the decay-in-time.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <title>Stability of Riemann Shocks for isothermal Euler by Inviscid limits of global-in-time large Navier-Stokes flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the isothermal gas dynamics. We first establish the global existence of strong solutions to the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes system for smooth initial data without any smallness conditions, assuming that the initial density has strictly positive lower bound. The existence result allows for possibly degenerate viscosity coefficients and admits different asymptotic states at the far fields. We then prove a contraction property for the strong solutions perturbed from viscous shocks, yielding uniform estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficients. This covers any large perturbations, and consequently, we establish the inviscid limits and their stability estimate. In other words, we demonstrate the stability of Riemann shocks to the one-dimensional isothermal Euler system in the class of vanishing viscosity limits of the associated Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Measuring inequality in society-oriented Lotka--Volterra-type kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a possible approach to measuring inequality in a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations that describe the evolution of distribution densities for two populations interacting pairwise due to social and/or economic factors. The macroscopic dynamics of their mean values follow a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations. Unlike classical models of wealth and opinion formation, which tend to converge toward a steady-state profile, the oscillatory behavior of these densities only leads to the formation of local equilibria within the Fokker-Planck system. This makes tracking the evolution of most inequality measures challenging. However, an insightful perspective on the problem is obtained by using the coefficient of variation, a simple inequality measure closely linked to the Gini index. Numerical experiments confirm that, despite the system's oscillatory nature, inequality initially tends to decrease.</description>

Abstract: The well-known Bielinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario for the universe near the cosmological singularity is supplemented with a few exact results following from the BKL asymptotic of the Einstein equations: (1) The cosmological singularity is proved to be an inevitable beginning or end of the universe as described by these equations. (2) Attaining the singularity from shrinking initial conditions requires infinite time parameter $\tau$; no singularity of any kind may occur in a finite $\tau$. (3) The previously found exact solution [P.G. and W. Piechocki, Eur. Phys. J. C 82:216 (2022)] is the only asymptotic with well-defined proportions between the directional scale factors which have been appropriately compensated against indefinite growth of anisotropy. In all other cases, the universe undergoes oscillations of Kasner type, which reduce the length scales to nearly zero in some directions, while largely extending it in the others. Together with instability of the exact solution [op. cit.], it makes the approach to the singularity inevitably chaotic. (4) Reduced equations are proposed and explicitly solved to describe these oscillations near their turning points. In logarithmic variables, the oscillations are found to have sawtooth shapes. A by-product is a quadric of kinetic energy, a simple geometric tool for all this analysis.</description>

      <title>On braided Hopf structures on exterior algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the exterior algebra of a vector space $V$ of dimension greater than one admits a one-parameter family of braided Hopf algebra structures, arising from its identification with a Nichols algebra. We explicitly compute the structure constants with respect to a natural set-theoretic basis.
  A one-parameter family of diagonal automorphisms exists, which we use to construct solutions to the (constant) Yang--Baxter equation. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$. We support this conjecture through computations for small values of $N$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>Simple Sufficient Criteria for Optimality of Entanglement Witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement witness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning property. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often satisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently structured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via entanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of some bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it is a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies to almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second criterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation value of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps.</description>

      <title>Permutons from Demazure Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze several new families of permutons arising from random processes involving the Demazure product on the symmetric group. First, we consider Demazure products associated to random pipe dreams, generalizing the Grothendieck permutons introduced by Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov by replacing staircase shapes with arbitrary order-convex shapes. Using the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with geometric jumps, we prove precise scaling limit and fluctuation results for the associated height functions, showing that these models belong to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We then consider permutons obtained by applying deterministic sequences of bubble-sort operators to random initial permutations. We again provide precise descriptions of the limiting permutons. In a special case, we deduce the exact forms of the standard bubble-sort permutons, the supports of which were computed by DiFranco.
  A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of the Demazure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical semiring. This allows us to define a Demazure product on the set of permutons. We discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the number of inversions of the Demazure product of two independent uniformly random permutations of size $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$.</description>

      <title>Relative phase and dynamical phase sensing in a Hamiltonian model of the optical SU(1,1) interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SU(1,1) interferometer introduced by Yurke, McCall, Klauder is reformulated starting from the Hamiltonian of two identical optical downconversion processes with opposite pump phases. From the four optical modes, two are singled out up to a relative phase by the assumption of exact alignment of the interferometer (i.e., mode indistinguishability). The state of the two resulting modes is parametrized by the nonlinearity $g$, the relative phase $\phi$, and a dynamical phase $\theta$ resulting from the interaction time. The optimal operating point for sensing the relative phase (dynamical phase) is found to be $\phi = \pi$ ($\theta=0$) with quantum Fisher information exhibiting Heisenberg scaling $E^{2}$ (logarithmically modified Heisenberg scaling $\left({E\over \ln E}\right)^{2}$). Compared to the predictions of the circuit-based model, we find in that in the Hamiltonian model: 1. the optimal operating points occur for a non-vacuum state inside the interferometer, and 2. measurement of the total photon number operator does not provide an estimate of the relative or dynamical phase with precision that saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, whereas an observable based on weighted shift operators becomes optimal as $g$ increases. The results indicate a first-principles approach for describing general optical quantum sensors containing multiple optical downconversion processes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an $n\times k$ matrix of i.i.d. Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Rapid phase ordering for Ising and Potts dynamics on random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising, and more generally, $q$-state Potts Glauber dynamics on random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices at low temperatures $\beta \gtrsim \frac{\log d}{d}$. The mixing time is exponential in $n$ due to a bottleneck between $q$ dominant phases consisting of configurations in which the majority of vertices are in the same state. We prove that for any $d\ge 7$, from biased initializations with $\epsilon_d n$ more vertices in state-$1$ than in other states, the Glauber dynamics quasi-equilibrates to the stationary distribution conditioned on having plurality in state-$1$ in optimal $O(\log n)$ time. Moreover, the requisite initial bias $\epsilon_d$ can be taken to zero as $d \to \infty$. Even for the $q=2$ Ising case, where the states are naturally identified with $\pm 1$, proving such a result requires a new approach in order to control negative information spread in spacetime despite the model being in low temperature and exhibiting strong local correlations. For this purpose, we introduce a coupled non-Markovian rigid dynamics for which a delicate temporal recursion on probability mass functions of minus spacetime cluster sizes establishes their subcriticality.</description>

Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the massive Dirac equation is studied in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry in horizon-penetrating Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates. We derive an integral representation for the Dirac propagator involving the solutions of the ordinary differential equations which arise in the separation of variables. Our integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac particles outside and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon.</description>

Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $sl(2, R)$ algebra, $sl_{\nu}(2,R)$ and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems, the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed based on the isomorphy of $so(3)$ and $su(2)$. Related applications are discussed as well.</description>

Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability associated to Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is briefly discussed. We then present the theory of the universal algebras associated to rack and general set-theoretic solutions. We show that these are quasi-triangular Hopf algebras and we derive the universal set-theoretic Drinfel'd twist. It is shown that this is an admissible twist allowing the derivation of the universal set-theoretic R-matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.</description>

Abstract: Energy-Based Models have emerged as a powerful framework in the realm of generative modeling, offering a unique perspective that aligns closely with principles of statistical mechanics. This review aims to provide physicists with a comprehensive understanding of EBMs, delineating their connection to other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and Normalizing Flows. We explore the sampling techniques crucial for EBMs, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and draw parallels between EBM concepts and statistical mechanics, highlighting the significance of energy functions and partition functions. Furthermore, we delve into recent training methodologies for EBMs, covering recent advancements and their implications for enhanced model performance and efficiency. This review is designed to clarify the often complex interconnections between these models, which can be challenging due to the diverse communities working on the topic.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Initially developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Drawing inspiration from these quantum methods, specifically the Matrix Product States (MPS), we apply them in a classical machine learning setting. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them effective in a supervised learning framework. Here, we present an MPS model, in which the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. In addition, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <title>Orthodiagonal Maps, Tilings of Rectangles, and their Convergence to Conformal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic result of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte associates to any finite planar network with distinguished source and sink vertices, a tiling of a rectangle by smaller subrectangles whose aspect ratios are given by the conductances of corresponding edges in the network. This tiling can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the uniformizing conformal map that maps a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends to a rectangle, so that the four prime ends are mapped to the four corners of the rectangle. \\ \\ We make this intuition precise by showing that if $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends $A,B,C,D$ in counterclockwise order and $(\Omega_{n})_{n\geq{1}}$ is a sequence of orthodiagonal maps with distinguished boundary vertices $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ in counterclockwise order, that are finer and finer approximations of $\Omega$ with its distinguished boundary points $A,B,C,D$, then the corresponding ``rectangle tiling maps" converge uniformly on compacts to the aforementioned conformal map on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>How to Construct Random Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space over the plane with the maximum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $p$-Wasserstein spaces over the branching spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $[-1,1]^2$ equipped with the maximum norm metric. We show that these spaces are isometrically rigid for all $p\geq1,$ meaning that all isometries of these spaces are induced by isometries of the underlying space via the push-forward operation. This is in contrast to the case of the Euclidean metric since with that distance the $2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not rigid. Also, we highlight that the $1$-Wasserstein space is not rigid over the closed interval $[-1,1]$, while according to our result, its two-dimensional analog, the closed unit ball $[-1,1]^2$ with the more complicated geodesic structure is rigid.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \frak c} $ for any $ {\frak c} &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics holds, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a new pre-Lie algebra in the framework of symplectic groupoids and, in turn, introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>
