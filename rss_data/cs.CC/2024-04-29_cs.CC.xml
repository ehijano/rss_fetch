      <title>Limits of Sequential Local Algorithms on the Random $k$-XORSAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random $k$-XORSAT problem is a random constraint satisfaction problem of $n$ Boolean variables and $m=rn$ clauses, which a random instance can be expressed as a $G\mathbb{F}(2)$ linear system of the form $Ax=b$, where $A$ is a random $m \times n$ matrix with $k$ ones per row, and $b$ is a random vector. It is known that there exist two distinct thresholds $r_{core}(k) &lt; r_{sat}(k)$ such that as $n \rightarrow \infty$ for $r &lt; r_{sat}(k)$ the random instance has solutions with high probability, while for $r_{core} &lt; r &lt; r_{sat}(k)$ the solution space shatters into an exponential number of clusters. Sequential local algorithms are a natural class of algorithms which assign values to variables one by one iteratively. In each iteration, the algorithm runs some heuristics, called local rules, to decide the value assigned, based on the local neighborhood of the selected variables under the factor graph representation of the instance.
  We prove that for any $r &gt; r_{core}(k)$ the sequential local algorithms with certain local rules fail to solve the random $k$-XORSAT with high probability. They include (1) the algorithm using the Unit Clause Propagation as local rule for $k \ge 9$, and (2) the algorithms using any local rule that can calculate the exact marginal probabilities of variables in instances with factor graphs that are trees, for $k\ge 13$. The well-known Belief Propagation and Survey Propagation are included in (2). Meanwhile, the best known linear-time algorithm succeeds with high probability for $r &lt; r_{core}(k)$. Our results support the intuition that $r_{core}(k)$ is the sharp threshold for the existence of a linear-time algorithm for random $k$-XORSAT.</description>

      <title>The power of shallow-depth Toffoli and qudit quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relevance of shallow-depth quantum circuits has recently increased, mainly due to their applicability to near-term devices. In this context, one of the main goals of quantum circuit complexity is to find problems that can be solved by quantum shallow circuits but require more computational resources classically.
  Our first contribution in this work is to prove new separations between classical and quantum constant-depth circuits. Firstly, we show a separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with quantum advice $\mathsf{QNC}^0/\mathsf{qpoly}$, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$, which is the class of classical constant-depth circuits with unbounded-fan in and $\pmod{p}$ gates. In addition, we show a separation between $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, which additionally has Toffoli gates with unbounded control, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$. This establishes the first such separation for a shallow-depth quantum class that does not involve quantum fan-out gates.
  Secondly, we consider $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with infinite-size gate sets. We show that these circuits, along with (classical or quantum) prime modular gates, can implement threshold gates, showing that $\mathsf{QNC}^0[p]=\mathsf{QTC}^0$. Finally, we also show that in the infinite-size gateset case, these quantum circuit classes for higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces do not offer any advantage to standard qubit implementations.</description>

      <title>Graph Search Trees and the Intermezzo Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last in-tree recognition problem asks whether a given spanning tree can be derived by connecting each vertex with its rightmost left neighbor of some search ordering. In this study, we demonstrate that the last-in-tree recognition problem for Generic Search is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. We utilize this finding to strengthen a complexity result from order theory. Given partial order $\pi$ and a set of triples, the $\mathsf{NP}$-complete intermezzo problem asks for a linear extension of $\pi$ where each first element of a triple is not between the other two. We show that this problem remains $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even when the Hasse diagram of the partial order forms a tree of bounded height. In contrast, we give an $\mathsf{XP}$ algorithm for the problem when parameterized by the width of the partial order. Furthermore, we show that $\unicode{x2013}$ under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ the running time of this algorithm is asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Tensor cumulants for statistical inference on invariant distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems in high-dimensional statistics appear to have a statistical-computational gap: a range of values of the signal-to-noise ratio where inference is information-theoretically possible, but (conjecturally) computationally intractable. A canonical such problem is Tensor PCA, where we observe a tensor $Y$ consisting of a rank-one signal plus Gaussian noise. Multiple lines of work suggest that Tensor PCA becomes computationally hard at a critical value of the signal's magnitude. In particular, below this transition, no low-degree polynomial algorithm can detect the signal with high probability; conversely, various spectral algorithms are known to succeed above this transition. We unify and extend this work by considering tensor networks, orthogonally invariant polynomials where multiple copies of $Y$ are "contracted" to produce scalars, vectors, matrices, or other tensors. We define a new set of objects, tensor cumulants, which provide an explicit, near-orthogonal basis for invariant polynomials of a given degree. This basis lets us unify and strengthen previous results on low-degree hardness, giving a combinatorial explanation of the hardness transition and of a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms that work below it, and proving tight lower bounds against low-degree polynomials for recovering rather than just detecting the signal. It also lets us analyze a new problem of distinguishing between different tensor ensembles, such as Wigner and Wishart tensors, establishing a sharp computational threshold and giving evidence of a new statistical-computational gap in the Central Limit Theorem for random tensors. Finally, we believe these cumulants are valuable mathematical objects in their own right: they generalize the free cumulants of free probability theory from matrices to tensors, and share many of their properties, including additivity under additive free convolution.</description>

      <title>Learning Quantum Processes with Quantum Statistical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning complex quantum processes is a central challenge in many areas of quantum computing and quantum machine learning, with applications in quantum benchmarking, cryptanalysis, and variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces the first learning framework for studying quantum process learning within the Quantum Statistical Query (QSQ) model, providing the first formal definition of statistical queries to quantum processes (QPSQs). The framework allows us to propose an efficient QPSQ learner for arbitrary quantum processes accompanied by a provable performance guarantee. We also provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm. In our new framework, we prove exponential query complexity lower bounds for learning unitary 2-designs, and a doubly exponential lower bound for learning haar-random unitaries. The practical relevance of this framework is exemplified through application in cryptography, highlighting vulnerabilities of a large class of Classical-Readout Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (CR-QPUFs), addressing an important open question in the field of quantum hardware security. This work marks a significant step towards understanding the learnability of quantum processes and shedding light on their security implications.</description>

      <title>$C_{2k+1}$-coloring of bounded-diameter graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the graph homomorphism problem, denoted by $Hom(H)$, we are given a graph $G$ and we have to determine whether there exists an edge-preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G) \to V(H)$. Note that $Hom(C_3)$, where $C_3$ is the cycle of length $3$, is equivalent to $3$-Coloring. The question whether $3$-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs is a well-known open problem. In this paper we study the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem on bounded-diameter graphs for $k\geq 2$, so we consider all other odd cycles than $C_3$. We prove that for $k\geq 2$, the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$(k+1)$ graphs -- note that such a result for $k=1$ would be precisely a polynomial-time algorithm for $3$-Coloring of diameter-$2$ graphs.
  Furthermore, we give subexponential-time algorithms for diameter-$(k+2)$ and -$(k+3)$ graphs.
  We complement these results with a lower bound for diameter-$(2k+2)$ graphs -- in this class of graphs the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in subexponential-time, unless the ETH fails.
  Finally, we consider another direction of generalizing $3$-Coloring on diameter-$2$ graphs. We consider other target graphs $H$ than odd cycles but we restrict ourselves to diameter $2$. We show that if $H$ is triangle-free, then $Hom(H)$ is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs.</description>

      <title>Unified Projection-Free Algorithms for Adversarial DR-Submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces unified projection-free Frank-Wolfe type algorithms for adversarial continuous DR-submodular optimization, spanning scenarios such as full information and (semi-)bandit feedback, monotone and non-monotone functions, different constraints, and types of stochastic queries. For every problem considered in the non-monotone setting, the proposed algorithms are either the first with proven sub-linear $\alpha$-regret bounds or have better $\alpha$-regret bounds than the state of the art, where $\alpha$ is a corresponding approximation bound in the offline setting. In the monotone setting, the proposed approach gives state-of-the-art sub-linear $\alpha$-regret bounds among projection-free algorithms in 7 of the 8 considered cases while matching the result of the remaining case. Additionally, this paper addresses semi-bandit and bandit feedback for adversarial DR-submodular optimization, advancing the understanding of this optimization area.</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we show new sample lower bounds, e.g.:
  - The first general lower bound $\Omega(r/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite state is at most $r$ or $\epsilon$-far, settling an open question raised in Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016).
  - A lower bound $\Omega((\sqrt n+\sqrt r)\cdot\sqrt r/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether an $n$-partite state is a matrix product state of bond dimension $r$ or $\epsilon$-far, improving the prior lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt n/\epsilon^2)$ by Soleimanifar and Wright (SODA 2022) and $\Omega(\sqrt r)$ by Aaronson et al. (ITCS 2024). Further, when perfect completeness is required, we provide a matching lower bound $\Omega(r^2/\epsilon^2)$ with respect to $r$ and $\epsilon$.
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite state is maximally entangled or $\epsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015) is optimal for this task.
  Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new query lower bounds:
  - A query lower bound $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{d/\Delta})$ for the $d$-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, improving the prior best $\Omega(\sqrt[4]{d})$ by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023) and $\tilde\Omega(1/\sqrt\Delta)$ by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024).
  Further, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>

      <title>Computing the $D$-base and $D$-relation in finite closure systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the $D$-base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the $D$-relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The $D$-base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the $D$-relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the $D$-base and the $D$-relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the $D$-base and $D$-relation. Specifically, we establish the $NP$-completeness of finding the $D$-relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the $D$-base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the $D$-base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the $D$-base and $D$-relation of a closure system.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Near-Optimal Noise Generation for Streaming Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the task of differentially private (DP) continual counting, we receive a stream of increments and our goal is to output an approximate running total of these increments, without revealing too much about any specific increment. Despite its simplicity, differentially private continual counting has attracted significant attention both in theory and in practice. Existing algorithms for differentially private continual counting are either inefficient in terms of their space usage or add an excessive amount of noise, inducing suboptimal utility.
  The most practical DP continual counting algorithms add carefully correlated Gaussian noise to the values. The task of choosing the covariance for this noise can be expressed in terms of factoring the lower-triangular matrix of ones (which computes prefix sums). We present two approaches from this class (for different parameter regimes) that achieve near-optimal utility for DP continual counting and only require logarithmic or polylogarithmic space (and time).
  Our first approach is based on a space-efficient streaming matrix multiplication algorithm for a class of Toeplitz matrices. We show that to instantiate this algorithm for DP continual counting, it is sufficient to find a low-degree rational function that approximates the square root on a circle in the complex plane. We then apply and extend tools from approximation theory to achieve this. We also derive efficient closed-forms for the objective function for arbitrarily many steps, and show direct numerical optimization yields a highly practical solution to the problem. Our second approach combines our first approach with a recursive construction similar to the binary tree mechanism.</description>
