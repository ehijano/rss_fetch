      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <title>Factorization of the Hilbert space of eternal black holes in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize recent results in two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity to study factorization of the Hilbert space of eternal black holes in quantum gravity with a negative cosmological constant in any dimension. We approach the problem by computing the trace of two-sided observables as a sum over a recently constructed family of semiclassically well-controlled black hole microstates. These microstates, which contain heavy matter shells behind the horizon and form an overcomplete basis of the Hilbert space, exist in any theory of gravity with general relativity as its low energy limit. Using this representation of the microstates, we show that the trace of operators dual to functions of the Hamiltonians of the left and right holographic CFTs factorizes into a product over left and right factors to leading order in the semiclassical limit. Under certain conditions this implies factorization of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Holography for Confined and Deformed Theories: TsT-Generated Solutions in type IIB Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of solutions of type IIB Supergravity, obtained through the TsT deformation of a seed background that is holographically dual to ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory compactified on a circle (with a twist). We explore various holographic observables, focusing on disentangling the contributions of confinement, marginal deformations, and their interplay. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of how certain observables are influenced by the dynamics of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes arising from the circle compactification. Our results offer an improved understanding of the connections between the type IIB deformed backgrounds and the dual QFTs.</description>

      <title>Back to the origins of brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new framework for brane-antibrane inflation where moduli stabilisation relies purely on perturbative corrections to the effective action. This guarantees that the model does not suffer from the eta-problem. The inflationary potential has two contributions: the tension of an antibrane at the tip of a warped throat, and its Coulomb interaction with a mobile brane. This represents the first realisation of the original idea of brane-antibrane inflation, as opposed to inflection point inflation which arises when the moduli are fixed with non-perturbative effects. Moreover, we formulate the brane-antibrane dynamics as an F-term potential of a nilpotent superfield in a manifestly supersymmetric effective theory. We impose compatibility with data and consistency conditions on control over the approximations and find that slow-roll inflation can occur in a large region of the underlying parameter space. The scalar spectral index is in agreement with data and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is beyond current observational reach. Interestingly, after the end of inflation the volume mode can, but does not need to, evolve towards a late-time minimum at larger values.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>A Note on Seiberg Duality for $N_{f} &lt; N_{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider SQCD for $N_{f}&lt;N_{c}$. We use a brane configuration in type IIA string theory to propose a Seiberg dual. The brane configuration that realises the magnetic theory contains $N_{f}$ branes and $N_{c}-N_{f}$ \textit{anti}-branes, leading to an $SU(N_{c}-N_{f})$ gauge theory with $N_{f}$ flavours. The potential between the branes triggers a RG flow and we argue that the IR theory realises the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. We use both field theory arguments, in particular anomaly matching, and a lift of the type IIA brane configuration to M-theory, in order to support our proposal.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: A Timeless History of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By directly probing the initial conditions of our universe, cosmological surveys offer us a unique observational handle on quantum field theory in curved spacetime with dynamical gravity and might even allow us to glean information about a full theory of quantum gravity. Here we report on recent progress to study the natural observables in the problem, namely cosmological correlators. After setting the stage, we review results from three different approaches. First, we present the in-out formalism as an interesting alternative to the well-known in-in formalism and stress some of its advantages, such as the derivation of recursion relations, correlators cutting rules and a proposal for a de Sitter scattering matrix. Second, we tackle the important open problem of constructing effective theories in curved spacetime, which generally requires an open quantum system approach. Third, we provide an executive summary of general properties of the field-theoretic wavefunction that follow from symmetries, unitarity, causality and locality. We describe how these properties can be leveraged to bootstrap all tree-level results and we discuss loop contributions.
  These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric KdV and mKdV flows based on $sl(2,1)$ algebra and its solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic construction for supersymmetric negative (non-local) flows for mKdV and KdV based on $sl(2,1)$ with a principal gradation is proposed in this paper. We show that smKdV and sKdV can be mapped onto each other through a gauge super Miura transformation, together with an additional condition for the negative flows, which ensure the supersymmetry of the negative sKdV flow. In addition, we classify both smKdV and sKdV flows with respect to the vacuum (boundary) solutions accepted for each flow, whether zero or non-zero. Each vacuum is used to derive both soliton solutions and the Heisenberg subalgebra for the smKdV hierarchy, where we present novel vertex operators and solutions for non-zero bosonic and fermionic vacuum. Finally, the gauge Miura transformation is used to obtain the sKdV solutions, which exhibit a rich degeneracy due to both multiple gauge super Miura transformations and multiple vacuum possibilities.</description>

      <title>Fermion bound states from Yukawa coupling with periodic bosonic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yukawa coupling of fermions with a periodic bosonic background is shown to give rise to several bound states to the fermionic spectrum, with some bound states gluing together around specific energy eingenvalues as the Yukawa coupling increases. This effect induces the presence of degenerate energy states inside the fermionic gap and may be of current interest.</description>

      <title>A note on the holographic time-like entanglement entropy in Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the holographic time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) in the boundary theory of three-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime. There have been various holographic proposals for TEE in recent years and we test those proposals in the Lifshitz background. We obtain the analytic result for TEE in each proposal, compare the results, and analyze how the anisotropic scaling affects the TEE. We find that different holographic proposals give the same result for TEE in the Lifshitz background. Our analysis further suggests that the TEE of the Lifshitz system contains real and imaginary parts, both of which depend on the anisotropic parameter.</description>

      <title>From Relativistic Gravity to the Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the non-relativistic limit of general relativity coupled to a $(p+1)$-form gauge field and a scalar field in arbitrary dimensions and investigate under which conditions this gives rise to a Poisson equation for a Newton potential describing Newton-Cartan gravity outside a massive $p$-dimensional extended object, a so-called $p$-brane. Given our Ansatz, we show that not all the $p$-branes satisfy the required conditions. We study theories whose dynamics is defined by a Lagrangian as well as systems that are defined by a set of equations of motion not related to a Lagrangian. We show that, within the Lagrangian approach, a Poisson equation can be obtained provided that the coupling of the scalar field is fine-tuned such that the non-relativistic Lagrangian is invariant under an emerging local dilatation symmetry. On the other hand, we demonstrate that in the absence of a Lagrangian a Poisson equation can be obtained from a set of equations of motion that is not dilatation invariant. We discuss how our Ansatz could be generalized such as to include more $p$-branes giving rise to a Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Factorization at the Quantum Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a horizon-skimming limit under which wave equations around large classes of black holes allow a determination of their low-lying (quasi-)degenerate normal modes. Building on our recent work, we use these ``quantum horizon" normal modes to study the thermodynamics of the parent black holes. A key observation is that the UV inputs (the location of the UV regulator, the number of species, and the cut-off in the angular Casimir quantum number) can all be combined into the freedom in a single real parameter. Remarkably, this parameter has an interpretation as the central charge of a holomorphically factorized 2D CFT, and choosing it to be the Kerr-CFT value reproduces the black hole's detailed thermodynamics from the statistical mechanics of normal modes. This perspective provides a heuristic understanding for why the Kerr-CFT central charge is related to the angular momentum of the black hole. The black holes we consider include Kerr-Newman in 3+1 dimensions and Cvetic-Youm in 4+1 dimensions (with all six charges), and they need not be BPS or extremal. Our results show that a refined version of the 't Hooftian quantum gas can be made fully consistent with the thermodynamics of very general black holes. This ``mechanical" approach to the central charge is not directly reliant on asymptotic symmetries in the extremal limit, where the black hole is often unstable.</description>

      <title>Non-Simply Laced Class-S Vertex Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.01577 the VOAs associated to 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class-S theories were constructed in addition to a generalization for non-simply laced Lie algebras. However, 6d (2,0) theories have an ADE classification, and therefore class-S theories which are engineered by them come in ADE types. Thus, these non-simply laced VOAs are not thought to correspond to 4d physical theories. Regardless, we analyze these VOAs and their Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions in an effort to determine their properties. We find that many of these reduced VOAs appear to correspond to actual 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. Additionally, we find what appear to be $F_4$ instanton VOAs, and hence from the proposal of arXiv:2201.13435 these correspond to 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge theories whose Coulomb branches are $F_4$ instanton moduli spaces. Using a construction of twisted class-S VOAs from non-simply laced ones, we find additional evidence that the $F_4$ instanton VOAs do not correspond to four-dimensional field theories and outline an analogous argument for the $G_2$ instanton case. Our method appears to be quite general and may be a promising technique for ruling out 4d origins of VOAs that are similar to those of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs, in addition to constructing VOAs of actual 4d theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy of a color flux tube in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), defined as the excess entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum of a region of color flux stretching between a heavy quark-anti-quark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. We show that FTE$^2$ can be expressed in terms of correlators of Polyakov loops, is manifestly gauge-invariant, and therefore free of the ambiguities in computations of the entanglement entropy in gauge theories related to the choice of the center algebra. Employing the replica trick, we compute FTE$^2$ for $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D and demonstrate that it is finite in the continuum limit. We explore the properties of FTE$^2$ for a half-slab geometry, which allows us to vary the width and location of the slab, and the extent to which the slab cross-cuts the color flux tube. Following the intuition provided by computations of FTE$^2$ in (1+1)D, and in a thin string model, we examine the extent to which our FTE$^2$ results can be interpreted as the sum of an internal color entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of the string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the enumerative geometry of stable maps to Calabi-Yau 5-folds $Z$ with a group action preserving the Calabi-Yau form. In the central case $Z=X \times \mathbb{C}^2$, where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 3-fold with a group action scaling the holomorphic volume form non-trivially, we conjecture that the disconnected equivariant Gromov-Witten generating series of $Z$ returns the Nekrasov-Okounkov equivariant K-theoretic PT partition function of $X$ and, under suitable rigidity conditions, its refined BPS index. We show that in the unrefined limit the conjecture reproduces known statements about the higher genus Gromov-Witten theory of $X$; we prove it for $X$ the resolved conifold; and we establish a refined cycle-level local/relative correspondence for local del Pezzo surfaces, implying the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the conjecture when $X$ is the local projective plane. We further establish B-model physics predictions of Huang-Klemm for refined higher genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$. In particular, we prove that our refined Gromov-Witten generating series obey extended holomorphic anomaly equations, are quasi-modular functions of $\Gamma_1(3)$, have leading asymptotics at the conifold point given by the logarithm of the Barnes double-Gamma function, and satisfy a version of the higher genus Crepant Resolution Correspondence with the refined orbifold Gromov-Witten theory of $[\mathbb{C}^3/\mu_3]$. This refines results, and partially proves conjectures, of Lho-Pandharipande, Coates-Iritani, and Bousseau-Fan-Guo-Wu.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of the Electroweak Scale with Dyson-Schwinger: Fermionic Mass Gap and Higher-order Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interaction of a fermion field $\psi$ with a scalar field $\phi$ and analyze the spectrum of the theory obtained in this way. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden fermion sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the fermion sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of fermion mass and the $\phi$ self-quartic. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated .</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Infrared Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-temperature behavior of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in Rindler vacuum, focusing on the relation between acceleration and thermality in quantum field theory. We illustrate how uniformly accelerated observers perceive the vacuum as a thermal state via Unruh effect, shedding light on the thermal properties of Rindler horizon. Through numerical simulations of the heat kernel, Unruh temperature, Planck distribution, and detector response, we demonstrate that acceleration enhances the thermal characteristics of quantum fields. These results provide important insights into horizon-induced thermality, with significant implications for black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theory called Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has significant implications for Cosmology. We derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein-Gordon equation using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss-Bonnet term, and logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss-Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive black hole shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.491$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Defrosting frozen stars: spectrum of non-radial oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frozen star model describes a type of black hole mimicker; that is, a regular, horizonless, ultracompact object that behaves just like a Schwarzschild black hole from an external-observer's perspective. In particular, the frozen star is bald, meaning that it cannot be excited. To mimic the possible excitations of the frozen star, it needs to be "defrosted" by allowing deviations from the maximally negative radial pressure and vanishing tangential pressure of the fluid sourcing the star. Here, we extend a previous study on non-radial oscillations of the defrosted star by considering, in addition to the fluid modes, the even-parity metric perturbations and their coupling to the fluid modes. At first, general equations are obtained for the perturbations of the energy density and pressure along with the even-parity perturbations of the metric for a static, spherically symmetric but otherwise generic background with an anisotropic fluid. This formal framework is then applied to the case of a defrosted star. The spectrum of non-radial oscillations is obtained to leading order in an expansion in terms of $\gamma$, which is the small relative deviation away from maximally negative radial pressure. We find that the sound velocity of the modes is non-relativistic, and proportional to $\gamma$, while their lifetime is parametrically long, proportional to $1/\gamma^2$. This result was anticipated by previous discussions on the collapsed polymer model, whose strongly non-classical interior is argued to provide a microscopic description of the frozen and defrosted star geometries. Our results will serve as a starting point for calculating the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves from an excited frozen star.</description>

      <title>Residual flavour (anti)symmetries at the modular self-dual point and constraints on neutrino masses and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of symmetries that remain unbroken at the self-dual point $\tau=i$ in modular invariant theories. Assuming that (a) the three generations of lepton doublets transform as an irreducible representation of a finite modular group $\Gamma_N$, and (b) the light neutrino masses arise from the Weinberg operator and are in modular form, we demonstrate that this setup yields a unique residual flavor symmetry or antisymmetry for the neutrinos, depending on the modular weight. In the antisymmetric case, one neutrino is always massless, and the other two can be degenerate if the mass matrix is real. These findings are independent of the level $N$. If the charged leptons are arranged to exhibit an appropriate residual symmetry from the same $\Gamma_N$, they determine a column of the leptonic mixing matrix, leading to specific correlations between the mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase. The presence of residual (anti)symmetries enables the application of standard flavor symmetry techniques to derive these predictions, and we scan all possible $\Gamma_N$ satisfying condition (a). Most solutions yield ${\cal O}(1)$ entries in the fixed column, favouring relatively large lepton mixing.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Shadows of Black Holes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00606v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two $f(R,T)$ gravity models and derive black hole solutions within these models. We focus on investigating how the $f(R,T)$ model influences the thermodynamic characteristics of black holes by studying their thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry. We consider five specific values of the thermodynamic parameter $\omega$, which signify five different classes of black hole solutions in general relativity (GR). We observe significant changes in the local topological properties of these black holes compared to GR, depending on the model parameters. Notably, we identify an additional topological class $W=0$ for some values of $\omega$ that is absent in the GR framework. We also study the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole using the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that the singular point, where the GTD scalar curvature diverges, corresponds exactly to the point where the heat capacity changes sign. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters of both models considered by utilizing black hole shadow data from the Sgr A* black hole, measured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <title>Viability of loop quantum cosmology at the level of bispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations by Planck indicate that CMB anisotropies are consistent with predictions of nearly Gaussian primordial perturbations as the one generated in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, loop quantum cosmology (LQC) generates a non-Gaussian bispectrum. In particular, calculations of primordial bispectrum generated in LQC shows that the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,\, k_2,\, k_3)$ is highly scale-dependent and oscillatory at long wavelengths and is nearly scale-invariant as in slow-roll at small scales. We discuss the viability of such a non-Gaussian bispectrum in the light of observations by Planck. More specifically, we model the bispectrum generated in LQC and compute its imprints on the CMB bispectrum. We then show that the CMB bispectrum generated in LQC though non-Gaussian, due to its highly oscillatory nature, is similar to that generated in slow-roll inflation and hence consistent with the observations by Planck.</description>

Abstract: We apply the linked cluster expansion as well as the quench action approach to study the time evolution of one-point functions after a quantum quench in integrable field theories. We argue that the relaxation towards the stationary value fundamentally differs depending on the locality properties of the considered observable: while for local operators both exponential and power-law decaying terms are present in the dynamics, for semi-local operators the latter are absent. We explicitly confirm this for the Ising field theory, the sinh-Gordon model, and the repulsive sine-Gordon model.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamics of black holes offers a promising avenue for exploring the quantum nature of black holes and quantum gravity. In this Letter, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of dyonic black holes in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, obtained from IIB supergravity. We demonstrate that the standard form of the first law of thermodynamics is inconsistent with the quantum statistical relation widely adopted in black hole physics. By employing the on-shell variation of the Euclidean action and the Iyer-Wald formalism, we resolve this discrepancy and derive both the standard form of the first law and Smarr formula for the dyonic black holes. Furthermore, our findings are corroborated by numerical tests and are consistent with general hydrodynamic expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework of $f(R,Q,P)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the curvature scalar, while $Q=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ and $P=R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}R^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin $1/2$ fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a pointed vertex operator algebra (VOA) we mean one whose modules are all simple currents (i.e. invertible), e.g. lattice VOAs. This paper systematically explores the interplay between their orbifolds and tensor category theory. We begin by supplying an elementary proof of the Dijkgraaf-Witten conjecture, which predicts the representation theory of holomorphic VOA orbifolds. We then apply that argument more generally to the situation where the automorphism subgroup fixes all VOA modules, and relate the result to recent work of Mason-Ng and Naidu. Here our results are complete. We then turn to the other extreme, where the automorphisms act fixed-point freely on the modules, and realize any possible nilpotent group as lattice VOA automorphisms. This affords a considerable generalization of the Tambara-Yamagami categories. We conclude by considering some hybrid actions. In this way we use tensor category theory to organize and generalize systematically several isolated examples and special cases scattered in the literature. Conversely, we show how VOA orbifolds can be used to construct broad classes of braided crossed fusion categories and modular tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Invariant Hamiltonian Bootstrap for Quantum Many-body Ground States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian bootstrap methods use semidefinite relaxation to find certifiable lower bounds to the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, along with approximations of ground state correlation functions. We give a thorough treatment of the role of symmetry in finite-dimensional Hamiltonian bootstrap, and show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce the required computational resources. We additionally incorporate arbitrary Hermitian linear constraints in our analysis, which allows one to find properties of the ground state within a specified subspace. We demonstrate our approach using the 1D Hubbard model. We find quantitative agreement with exact diagonalization on $10$ sites at both half-filling and quarter-filling. Additionally, we apply our method on $100$ sites at half-filling and find quantitative agreement with the exact ground state energy density in thermodynamic limit derived from the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect and the thermofield double state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.09869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this review is to provide a pedagogical development of the Unruh effect and the thermofield double state. In Section 2, we construct Rindler spacetime and analyze the perspective of an observer undergoing constant acceleration in Minkowski spacetime, which motivates the establishment of the relationship between the Fourier modes in both geometries using the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation. In Section 3, we explore the underlying physics leading to the Unruh effect and draw an analogy to the thermal radiation observed around a Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, in Section 4, we derive the thermofield double state by conducting a Euclidean analysis of the field and geometry.</description>

      <title>Geometrodynamics of a 2D Curved Surface due to a Constrained Quantum Particle via its Gravitational Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unique and novel extension of da Costa's calculation of a quantum mechanically constrained particle. This is achieved by analyzing the perturbative back reaction of the quantum confined particle's eigenstates and spectra upon the geometry of the curved surface itself, thereby addressing the problem of shape optimization in this scenario. We do this by first formulating a two dimensional action principle of the quantum constrained particle, which upon wave function variation reproduces Schr\"odinger's equation including da Costa's surface curvature induced potentials. We further demonstrate that our derived action principle is dual to a two dimensional dilation gravity theory and we vary its functional with respect to the embedded two dimensional inverse-metric to obtain the respective geometrodynamical Einstein equation. We solve this resulting Einstein equation perturbatively by first solving the da Costa's Schr\"odinger equation to obtain an initial eigensystem, which is used as initial-input data for a perturbed metric inserted into the derived Einstein equation. As a proof of concept, we perform this calculation on a two-sphere and show its first iterative perturbed shape evolution. We also turn on external electromagnetic fields, which manifest themselves via a surface induced, pulled-back $U(1)$ coupling in our two dimensional dual gravity theory, thereby revealing interesting and rich new surface physics in this specific paradigm.</description>

      <title>Superconformal indices and localization in $N=2B$ quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconformal `type B' quantum mechanical sigma models arise in a variety of interesting contexts, such as the description of D-brane bound states in an AdS$_2$ decoupling limit. Focusing on $N=2B$ models, we study superconformal indices which count short multiplets and provide an alternative to the standard Witten index, as the latter suffers from infrared issues. We show that the basic index receives contributions from lowest Landau level states in an effective magnetic field and that, due to the noncompactness of the target space, it is typically divergent. Fortunately, the models of interest possess an additional target space isometry which allows for the definition of a well-behaved refined index. We compute this index using localization of the functional integral and find that the result agrees with a naive application of the Atiyah-Bott fixed point formula outside of it's starting assumptions. In the simplest examples, this formula can also be directly verified by explicitly computing the short multiplet spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a classical open string representing a meson in the hard-wall geometry and consider the $S^5$ compact space. The existence of a confining region leads to a discrete set of string configurations parameterized by the number $n$ of complete turnarounds $S^5$ great circles. Unlike the conformal case, the string in the bulk can explore $S^5$ even in the case of equal boundary conditions on its endpoints. The string solutions are parameterized by an internal dimensionless conserved charge $l_n$. The $q\bar{q}$ potential is linear for large separations, and the string tension is sensitive to $l_n$.</description>

Abstract: Sen's formalism is a mechanism for eliminating constraints on the dynamical fields that are imposed independently from equations of motion by employing spurious free fields. In this note a cyclic homotopy associative algebra underlying Sen's formalism is developed. The novelty lies in the construction of a symplectic form and cyclic $A_\infty$ maps on an extended algebra that combines the dynamical and spurious fields. This algebraic presentation makes the gauge invariance of theories using Sen's formulation manifest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we test and extend a proposal of Gu, Pei, and Zhang for an application of decomposition to three-dimensional theories with one-form symmetries and to quantum K theory. The theories themselves do not decompose, but, OPEs of parallel one-dimensional objects (such as Wilson lines) and dimensional reductions to two dimensions do decompose, sometimes in two independent ways. We apply this to extend conjectures for quantum K theory rings of gerbes (realized by three-dimensional gauge theories with one-form symmetries) via both orbifold partition functions and gauged linear sigma models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the asymptotic symmetries of electromagnetism non-minimally coupled to scalar fields, with non-minimal couplings of the Fermi type that occur in extended supergravity models. Our study is carried out at spatial infinity where minimal and non-minimal couplings exhibit very different asymptotic properties: while the former generically cannot be neglected at infinity, the latter can. Electromagnetic non-minimal couplings are in that respect similar to gravitational minimal couplings, which are also asymptotically subdominant. Because the non-minimally interacting model is asymptotic to the free one, its asymptotic symmetries are the same as the ones of the free theory, i.e., described by angle-dependent $u(1)$ gauge transformations. We also analyse the duality symmetry and show that it is broken to its compact subgroup by the asymptotic conditions. Finally, we consider logarithmic gauge transformations and use them to simplify the symmetry algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <title>Notes on peculiarities of Schwinger--DeWitt technique: one-loop double poles, total-derivative terms and determinant anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss peculiarities of the Schwinger--DeWitt technique for quantum effective action, associated with the origin of dimensionally regularized double-pole divergences of the one-loop functional determinant for massive Proca model in a curved spacetime. These divergences have the form of the total-derivative term generated by integration by parts in the functional trace of the heat kernel for the Proca vector field operator. Because of the nonminimal structure of second-order derivatives in this operator, its vector field heat kernel has a nontrivial form, involving the convolution of the scalar d'Alembertian Green's function with its heat kernel. Moreover, its asymptotic expansion is very different from the universal predictions of Gilkey-Seeley heat kernel theory because the Proca operator violates one of the basic assumptions of this theory -- the nondegeneracy of the principal symbol of an elliptic operator. This modification of the asymptotic expansion explains the origin of double-pole total-derivative terms. Another hypostasis of such terms is in the problem of multiplicative determinant anomalies -- lack of factorization of the functional determinant of a product of differential operators into the product of their individual determinants. We demonstrate that this anomaly should have the form of total-derivative terms and check this statement by calculating divergent parts of functional determinants for products of minimal and nonminimal second-order differential operators in curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the holographic duality between $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theory (CFT) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with finite radial truncation has received significant attention. The study of $T\bar{T}$ deformation within the framework of de Sitter (dS)/CFT duality has also progressed. This paper shows that the trace flow equation in dS spacetime can be analytically extended from its AdS counterpart through double Wick rotations. Additionally, we generalize the replica sphere method in both AdS and dS holography to derive a general expression for the entanglement entropy of arbitrary single spatial intervals. For both finite size and finite temperature systems, we obtain the entanglement entropy corrections due to $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Finally, using strong subadditivity and boosted strong subadditivity, we show that the dual field theory on the timelike boundary is non-local in dS holography.</description>

Abstract: We review recent results for heterotic moduli and the Hull--Strominger system. In particular, we discuss mathematical properties of the recently derived deformation operator $\bar D$ associated to the deformation complex of heterotic $SU(3)$ solutions. We review results on Serre duality, showing that the operator has a vanishing index, and discuss a notion of \v{C}ech cohomology and a particular instance of a Dolbeault theorem for $\bar D$. Specifically, the cohomology parametrising infinitesimal deformations is isomorphic to the first \v{C}ech cohomology of an associated cochain complex. This will be useful for future research, as it provides a more algebraic handle on the heterotic moduli problem, which is useful for understanding notions of stability, geometric invariants, and enumerative geometry for the Hull--Strominger system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss known maximal D-dimensional supergravities of two types: type I with G/H coset spaces and type II derived by compactification from higher dimensions without dualization, these have less manifest symmetries. In 4D and 6D in type I models we perform explicit gauge-fixing of local H symmetries in unitary gauges: symmetric, Iwasawa, and partial Iwasawa. In 4D supergravity I in symmetric gauge global H-invariance and nonlinearly realized G-symmetry are valid on shell, classically. The global H-symmetry and G-symmetry in Iwasawa-type gauges in type I and type II supergravities are not manifest, if at all present. This fact raises the issue of the gauge equivalence of the S-matrix of various gauge-fixed D-dimensional supergravities and its relation to the ones computable using superamplitude methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the reactions $\pi p \to \pi p$ and $\pi p \to \pi p \gamma$ from a general quantum field theory (QFT) point of view, describing these reactions in QCD and lowest relevant order of electromagnetism. We consider the pion-proton elastic scattering both off shell and on shell. The on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ scattering are described by two invariant amplitudes, while the off-shell amplitudes contain eight invariant amplitudes. We study the photon emission amplitudes in the soft-photon limit where the c.m. photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes is considered and the terms of the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. These terms can be expressed by the on-shell invariant amplitudes and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and~$t$. The pole term $\propto \omega^{-1}$ in the amplitudes corresponds to Weinberg's soft-photon theorem and is well known from the literature. We derive the next-to-leading term $\propto \omega^{0}$ using only rigorous methods of QFT. We give the relation of the Laurent series for $\pi^{0} p \to \pi^{0} p \gamma$ and Low's soft-photon theorem. Our formulas for the amplitudes in the limit $\omega \to 0$ are valid for photon momentum $k$ satisfying $k^{2} \geqslant 0$, $k^{0} = \omega \geqslant 0$, that is, for both real and virtual photons. Here we consider a limit where with $\omega \to 0$ we have also $k^{2} \to 0$. We discuss the behavior of the corresponding cross-sections for $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{-} p \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$. We consider cross sections for unpolarized as well as polarized protons in the initial and final states.</description>

We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic lattices and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices are a new type of synthetic quantum matter emulated in circuit quantum electrodynamics and electric-circuit networks, where particles coherently hop on a discrete tessellation of two-dimensional negatively curved space. While real-space methods and a reciprocal-space hyperbolic band theory have been recently proposed to analyze the energy spectra of those systems, discrepancies between the two sets of approaches remain. In this work, we reconcile those approaches by first establishing an equivalence between hyperbolic band theory and $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills theory on higher-genus Riemann surfaces. We then show that moments of the density of states of hyperbolic tight-binding models correspond to expectation values of Wilson loops in the quantum gauge theory and become exact in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to the existence of M{\o}ller maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M{\o}ller maps are identifications between the observables of a perturbatively interacting physical system and the observables of its underlying free (i.e. non-interacting) system. This work studies and characterizes obstructions to the existence of such identifications. The main results are existence and importantly also non-existence theorems, which in particular imply that M{\o}ller maps do not exist for non-Abelian Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theories on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Josephson current through the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model fully contacted by two BCS superconductors, such that all modes of the dot contribute to the coupling, which encodes hopping and spin-flip processes. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting gap. At finite temperature, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the interaction self-energy and the tunneling matrix for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <title>The Common Solution Space of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the solution space for the field equations of Einstein's General Relativity for various static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We consider the vacuum case, represented by the Schwarzschild black hole; the de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry, which includes a cosmological constant; the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometry, which accounts for the presence of charge. Additionally we consider the homogenenous and anisotropic locally rotational Bianchi II spacetime in the vacuum. Our analysis reveals that the field equations for these scenarios share a common three-dimensional group of point transformations, with the generators being the elements of the $D\otimes_{s}T_{2}$ Lie algebra, known as the semidirect product of dilations and translations in the plane. Due to this algebraic property the field equations for the aforementioned gravitational models can be expressed in the equivalent form of the null geodesic equations for conformally flat geometries. Consequently, the solution space for the field equations is common, and it is the solution space for the free particle in a flat space. This appoach open new directions on the construction of analytic solutions in gravitational physics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Natural anomalous cyclotron response in a hydrodynamic local quantum critical metal in a periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study DC magnetotransport in a quantum critical metal in the presence of a lattice. In the regime where the transport is hydrodynamical the interplay of the Lorentz force and the lattice gives rise to a natural anomalous contribution to the cyclotron frequency that changes it from its canonical charge-to-mass ratio. The size of this effect is universal as it is determined only by thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably the Drude weight changes in such a way that to first subleading order in the lattice strength the Hall resistivity and Hall coefficient do not change, though the Hall angle does change. We confirm our results with numerical simulations in a holographic model of a strange metal. For weak lattice strength these hydrodynamic effects are shown to be present. The numerical simulations also suggest that strong lattice effects beyond a hydrodynamic regime may provide a resolution to the experimentally observed anomalous Hall response of cuprate strange metals.</description>
