      <title>H3PIMAP: A Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Objective DNN Mapping Framework on Electronic-Photonic Processing-in-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration demands a paradigm shift beyond the limitations of purely electronic or photonic architectures. Photonic analog computing delivers unmatched speed and parallelism but struggles with data movement, robustness, and precision. Electronic processing-in-memory (PIM) enables energy-efficient computing by co-locating storage and computation but suffers from endurance and reconfiguration constraints, limiting it to static weight mapping. Neither approach alone achieves the balance needed for adaptive, efficient AI. To break this impasse, we study a hybrid electronic-photonic-PIM computing architecture and introduce H3PIMAP, a heterogeneity-aware mapping framework that seamlessly orchestrates workloads across electronic and optical tiers. By optimizing workload partitioning through a two-stage multi-objective exploration method, H3PIMAP harnesses light speed for high-throughput operations and PIM efficiency for memory-bound tasks. System-level evaluations on language and vision models show H3PIMAP achieves a 2.74x energy efficiency improvement and a 3.47x latency reduction compared to homogeneous architectures and naive mapping strategies. This proposed framework lays the foundation for hybrid AI accelerators, bridging the gap between electronic and photonic computation for next-generation efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Holistic Optimization Framework for FPGA Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized accelerators have transformed modern computing by enhancing energy efficiency and performance through specialization. Field Programmable Gate Arrays play a pivotal role in this domain due to their flexibility and high-performance potential. High-Level Synthesis and source-to-source compilers simplify hardware design by converting high-level code into hardware descriptions enriched with directives. However, achieving high Quality of Results in FPGA designs remains challenging, requiring complex transformations, strategic directive use, and efficient data management. While existing approaches like Design Space Exploration (DSE) and source-to-source compilers have made strides in improving performance, they often address isolated aspects of the design process. This paper introduces Prometheus, a holistic framework that integrates task fusion, tiling, loop permutation, computation-communication overlap, and concurrent task execution into a unified design space. Leveraging Non-Linear Problem methodologies, Prometheus explores this space to find solutions under resource constraints, enabling bitstream generation.</description>
