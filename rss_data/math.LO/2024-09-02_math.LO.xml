      <title>Relational Companions of Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variable inclusion companions of logics have lately been thoroughly studied by multiple authors. There are broadly two types of these companions: the left and the right variable inclusion companions. Another type of companions of logics induced by Hilbert-style presentations (Hilbert-style logics) were introduced in a recent paper. A sufficient condition for the restricted rules companion of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide with its left variable inclusion companion was proved there, while a necessary condition remained elusive. The present article has two parts. In the first part, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the left variable inclusion and the restricted rules companions of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide. In the rest of the paper, we recognize that the variable inclusion restrictions used to define variable inclusion companions of a logic $\langle\mathcal{L},\vdash\rangle$ are relations from $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{L})$ to $\mathcal{L}$. This leads to a more general idea of a relational companion of a logical structure, a framework that we borrow from the field of universal logic. We end by showing that even Hilbert-style logics and the restricted rules companions of these can be brought under the umbrella of the general notions of logical structures and their relational companions that are discussed here.</description>

      <title>Strong reducibilities and set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Medvedev reducibility in the context of set theory -- specifically, forcing and large cardinal hypotheses. Answering a question of Hamkins and Li \cite{HaLi}, we show that the Medvedev degrees of countable ordinals are far from linearly ordered in multiple ways, our main result here being that there is a club of ordinals which is an antichain with respect to Medvedev reducibility. We then generalize these results to arbitrary ``reasonably-definable" reducibilities, under appropriate set-theoretic hypotheses.
  We then turn from ordinals to general structures. We show that some of the results above yield characterizations of counterexamples to Vaught's conjecture; another applies to all situations, assigning an ordinal to any reasonable class of structures and ``measure" on that class. We end by discussing some directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structure theory and interpolation failures in semilinear logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study integral residuated chains, and we solve some open problems related to the study of the amalgamation property in varieties of residuated lattices, or equivalently, about the deductive interpolation property in substructural logics. More precisely, we find a V-formation consisting of 2-potent finite commutative integral chains that does not have an amalgam, nor a one-amalgam, in residuated chains; as most relevant consequences, this entails that the following varieties do not have the amalgamation property: semilinear commutative (integral) residuated lattices, MTL-algebras, involutive and pseudocomplemented MTL-algebras, and all of their n-potent subvarieties for n strictly larger than 1. These results entail the failure of the deductive interpolation property for the corresponding substructural logics.</description>

      <title>Computably totally disconnected locally compact groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study totally disconnected, locally compact (t.d.l.c.) groups from an algorithmic perspective. We give various approaches to defining computable presentations of t.d.l.c.\ groups, and show their equivalence. In the process, we obtain an algorithmic Stone-type duality between t.d.l.c.~groups and certain countable ordered groupoids given by the compact open cosets. We exploit the flexibility given by these different approaches to show that several natural groups, such as $\Aut(T_d)$ and $\SL_n(\QQ_p)$, have computable presentations. We show that many construction leading from t.d.l.c.\ groups to new t.d.l.c.\ groups have algorithmic versions that stay within the class of computably presented t.d.l.c.\ groups. This leads to further examples, such as $\PGL_n(\QQ_p)$. We study whether objects associated with computably t.d.l.c.\ groups are computable: the modular function, the scale function, and Cayley-Abels graphs in the compactly generated case. We give a criterion when computable presentations of t.d.l.c.~groups are unique up to computable isomorphism, and apply it to $\QQ_p$ as an additive group, and the semidirect product $\ZZ\ltimes \QQ_p$. We give (joint with Willis) an example of a computably t.d.l.c. group with noncomputable scale function.</description>

      <title>On collection schemes and Gaifman's splitting theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study model theoretic characterizations of various collection schemes over $\mathbf{PA}^-$ from the viewpoint of Gaifman's splitting theorem. Among other things, we prove that for any $n \geq 0$ and $M \models \mathbf{PA}^-$, the following are equivalent:
  1. $M$ satisfies the collection scheme for $\Sigma_{n+1}$ formulas.
  2. For any $K, N \models \mathbf{PA}^-$, if $M \subseteq_{\mathrm{cof}} K$, $M \prec_{\Delta_0} K$ and $M \prec N$, then $M \prec_{\Sigma_{n+2}} K$ and $\sup_N(M) \prec_{\Sigma_n} N$.
  3. For any $N \models \mathbf{PA}^-$, if $M \prec N$, then $M \prec_{\Sigma_{n+2}} \sup_N(M) \prec_{\Sigma_{n}} N$.
  Here, $\sup_N(M)$ is the unique $K$ satisfying $M \subseteq_{\mathrm{cof}} K \subseteq_{\mathrm{end}} N$. We also investigate strong collection schemes and parameter-free collection schemes from the similar perspective.</description>

      <title>Definability of band structures on posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idempotent semigroups (bands) that give rise to partial orders by defining $a \leq b \iff a \cdot b = a$ are the "right-regular" bands (RRB), which are axiomatized by $x\cdot y \cdot x = y \cdot x$. In this work we consider the class of "associative posets", which comprises all partial orders underlying right-regular bands, and study to what extent the ordering determines the possible "compatible" band structures and their canonicity.
  We show that the class of associative posets in the signature $\{ \leq \}$ is not first-order axiomatizable. We also show that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent over $\mathit{ZF}$ to the fact that every tree with finite branches is associative.
  We study the smaller class of "normal" posets (corresponding to right-normal bands) and give a structural characterization.</description>

      <title>Lyndon interpolation property for extensions of $\mathbf{S4}$ and intermediate propositional logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and the uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) for extensions of $\mathbf{S4}$ and intermediate propositional logics. We prove that among the 18 consistent normal modal logics of finite height extending $\mathbf{S4}$ known to have CIP, 11 logics have LIP and 7 logics do not. We also prove that for intermediate propositional logics, the Craig interpolation property, LIP, and ULIP are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Many subalgebras of $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathit{fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In answer to a question on Mathoverflow we show that the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathit{fin}$ contains a family $\{\mathcal{B}_X:X\subseteq\mathfrak{c}\}$ of subalgebras with the property that $X\subseteq Y$ implies $\mathcal{B}_Y$ is a subalgebra of $\mathcal{B}_X$ and if $X\not\subseteq Y$ then $\mathcal{B}_Y$ is not embeddable into~$\mathcal{B}_X$. The proof proceeds by Stone duality and the construction of a suitable family of separable zero-dimensional compact spaces.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Tournaments and the Orientation Completion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed finite set of finite tournaments ${\mathcal F}$, the ${\mathcal F}$-free orientation problem asks whether a given finite undirected graph $G$ has an $\mathcal F$-free orientation, i.e., whether the edges of $G$ can be oriented so that the resulting digraph does not embed any of the tournaments from ${\mathcal F}$. We prove that for every ${\mathcal F}$, this problem is in P or NP-complete. Our proof reduces the classification task to a complete complexity classification of the orientation completion problem for ${\mathcal F}$, which is the variant of the problem above where the input is a directed graph instead of an undirected graph, introduced by Bang-Jensen, Huang, and Zhu (2017). Our proof uses results from the theory of constraint satisfaction, and a result of Agarwal and Kompatscher (2018) about infinite permutation groups and transformation monoids.</description>
