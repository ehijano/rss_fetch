      <title>Algebras, Entanglement Islands, and Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent work has postulated the existence of an "observer" for a consistent definition of subregion algebras in gravitational universes. The subregion algebras consist of operators dressed to this "observer" and are typically Type II von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless, as opposed to standard physical systems, such an "observer" was postulated to have a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\text{obs}}$ linear in phase space variable. This linear form suggests that the complete dynamics of such an "observer" should also be controlled by an external system or some underlying degrees of freedom within the system. In this paper, we show that this is exactly the case in the island model. In the island model, we have a gravitational asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime coupled with a non-gravitational bath, and the diffeomorphism symmetries in the gravitational AdS are spontaneously broken due to the bath coupling. In this setup, the "observer" is constructed using the Goldstone vector field associated with the spontaneously broken diffeomorphism symmetry, and the external system that also controls the dynamics of the "observer" is the non-gravitational bath. The basic consistency of the entanglement wedge reconstruction requires operators in the entanglement island to be dressed to this "observer". Thus, we establish the result that entanglement islands correspond to emergent Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebras from the holographic dual perspective. This result relies on assuming the geometric modular flow conjecture. Our study also raises a question for earlier constructions of Type II$_{1}$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Compton amplitude and Contact term(s) in the Spinor Helicity formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gauge theories, contact terms play an important role in ensuring gauge invariance. In the spinor helicity formalism, the choice of a gauge-fixing condition manifests itself in the form of the choice of reference vector to write the massless polarization vector(s). However, this choice must be irrelevant in any gauge-invariant observable. We use this principle to determine contact term for Electromagnetic Compton amplitude. We considered three-point function between two massive particles \&amp; a photon to be one which is responsible for soft photon theorem/Coulomb and demonstrate that it is possible to use the above-mentioned principle to find the contact term for the tree-level Compton amplitude of two bosonic massive spinning particles and two photons. The final result does not suffer from any spurious poles.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Relativistic Strings Propagate Without Geometric Baggage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal and dynamically consistent formulation of non-relativistic bosonic string theory in a Newton-Cartan (NC) background. Starting from a reparametrization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, we develop the Hamiltonian framework and perform a complete Dirac constraint analysis. The resulting structure exhibits first-class constraints that generate worldsheet diffeomorphisms, confirming the internal gauge consistency of the model. Using an interpolating Lagrangian, we derive a Polyakov-type action that enables a direct comparison with symmetry-based constructions known as gauging the algebra (GTA) approaches, which promote non-relativistic symmetry algebras to local symmetries. In contrast to GTA formulations, which require additional background fields to achieve algebraic closure, our model derives all necessary geometric data dynamically from the string evolution itself. This establishes that standard Newton-Cartan geometry is sufficient to support consistent non-relativistic string dynamics. Our results provide a conceptually transparent and technically robust foundation for future studies of non-relativistic string theory in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalization Group flow of distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization Group flows relate the values of couplings at different scales. Here, we go beyond the Renormalization Group flow of individual trajectories and derive an evolution equation for a distribution on the space of couplings. This shift in perspective can provide new insights, even in theories for which the Renormalization Group flow of individual couplings is well understood. As a first application, we propagate errors under the Renormalization Group flow. Characteristic properties of an error distribution, such as its maximum or highest density region, cannot be propagated at the level of individual couplings, but require our evolution equation for the distribution on the space of couplings. We demonstrate this by calculating the most probable value for the metastability scale in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. Our second application is the emergence of structure in sets of couplings. We discover that infrared-attractive fixed points do not necessarily attract the maximum of the distribution when the Renormalization Group is evolved over a finite range of scales. Instead, sharply peaked maxima can build up at coupling values that cannot be inferred from individual trajectories. We demonstrate this emergence of structure for the Standard Model, starting from a broad distribution at the Planck scale. The Renormalization Group flow favors the phenomenological ordering of third-generation Yukawa couplings and, strikingly, we find that the most probable values for the Abelian hypercharge and Higgs quartic coupling lie close to their observed values.</description>

      <title>Non-conformal Line Defect (Shell Operator) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$: Spinning and Higher Point Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a special type of non-conformal line defect, known as thin-shell operator, has played a key role in demonstrating the chaotic nature of the high energy sector in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. The chaotic nature was revealed concretely through a matching among the vacuum Virasoro block in holographic CFT$_2$, ETH analysis, and gravitational on-shell partition function in AdS$_3$ with nontrivial backreaction. In this work, we generalize this matching in two ways. First, we compute two-point correlator of the spinning defects, in contrast to previous scalar defect correlator, in both the microcanonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble. Holographically, these spinning defects correspond to bulk domain walls composed of dust particles with angular momentum. Using the first order formalism of gravity, it is shown that the junction condition deviates from Israel's junction condition, resulting in a discontinuous metric across the domain wall. Second, we calculate general higher point correlators involving multiple scalar defects and provide a detailed example with four defects. We see explicitly that, because line operators in CFT$_2$ are codimension one objects, the correlators depend on the order in which these nonlocal defects are inserted, unlike the Euclidean correlators of local operators. In both generalizations, we achieve a precise matching between field theory solutions, ETH analysis and gravitational on-shell actions.</description>

      <title>Operators of Dirac's theory with mass and axial chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac equation with mass and axial chemical potential is solved analytically obtaining the mode spinors and corresponding projection operators giving the spectral representations of the principal conserved operators. In this framework, the odd partner of the Pryce spin operator is defined for the first time showing how these operators may be combined for defining the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators of Dirac's theory of massive fermions either in the free case or in the presence of the axial chemical potential. The quantization procedure is applied in both these cases obtaining two distinct operator algebras in which the particle and antiparticle spin and polarization operators take canonical forms. In this approach statistical operators with independent particle and antiparticle vortical chemical potentials may be constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of matrix models such that their partition functions are tau functions of the universal character (UC) hierarchy. This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Flavor Symmetries and Winding Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular flavor symmetries have been proposed as a new way to address the flavor problem. It is known that they can emerge from string compactifications. We discuss this connection in detail, and show how the congruence subgroups of SL(2,Z), which underlie many modular flavor symmetries, emerge from stringy duality symmetries by orbifolding. This requires an analysis of massive states, which reveals a picture that is more intricate than the well-known situation on the torus. It involves towers of states of different quantum numbers, related by modular transformations. Members of different towers become massless at different points in moduli space. We also show that, at least in the Z_3 orbifold, the string selection rules can be understood as discrete remnants of continuous gauge symmetries. Non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries arise as relics of various, relatively misaligned, continuous Abelian gauge symmetries. The generators of these U(1) symmetries give rise to CP-violating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. If the modulus settles close to a critical point, the corresponding gauge bosons may be light enough to be searched for at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Bulk Spacetime Encoding via Boundary Ambiguities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct the exterior of a static, planar-symmetric black hole from an infinite set of discrete momentum-space locations, known as pole-skipping points, where the boundary Green's function becomes ambiguous. The reconstruction is fully analytical and involves solving only linear equations. It further enables a reinterpretation of any pure gravitational field equation in pole-skipping data. Moreover, our method reveals that the pole-skipping points are redundant: only a subset is independent, while the rest are fixed by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial constraints. These identities are universal, independent of the details of the bulk geometry, including its dimensionality, asymptotic behavior, or the existence of a holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning problems in type IIA string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a unified resolution to the strong CP, hierarchy, and cosmological constant problems in type IIA flux compactifications, via 4-form fluxes and KL stabilization. We show that the strong CP problem can be effectively "solved" in type IIA orientifold constructions, particularly in the type IIA $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ model. Building on this, we explore whether the remaining two fine-tuning problems can also be resolved within the same setup. To obtain a small cosmological constant, we adopt the KL scenario and find that, in order to avoid conflicts with the swampland distance conjecture and to eliminate the need for fine-tuning, the perturbative superpotential $\Delta W$ must take the form $f_0 U^3$. Additionally, we compute the gravitino mass. This allows for a resolution of the hierarchy problem without introducing fine-tuning if gravitino mass lies below 100 TeV. Taken together, these results suggest that the type IIA $T^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold model provides a promising framework in which all three fine-tuning problems may be addressed simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality in a relativistic Yukawa theory with Luttinger fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a Yukawa model featuring a dynamical scalar field coupled to relativistic Luttinger fermions. Using the functional renormalization group (RG) as well as large-$N_{\text{f}}$ or perturbative expansions, we observe the emergence of an infrared attractive partial fixed point in all interactions at which all couplings become RG irrelevant. At the partial fixed point, the scalar mass parameter is RG marginal, featuring a slow logarithmic running towards the regime of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The long-range behavior of the model is characterized by mass gap formation in the scalar and the fermionic sector independently of the initial conditions. Most importantly, a large scale separation between the low-energy scales and the microscopic scales, e.g., a high-energy cutoff scale, is naturally obtained for generic initial conditions without the need for any fine-tuning. We interpret the properties of our model as a relativistic version of self-organized criticality, a phenomenon observed in specific statistical or dynamical systems. This entails natural scale separation and universal long-range observables. We determine nonperturbative estimates for the latter including the scalar and fermionic mass gaps.</description>

      <title>The Holography of Spread Complexity: A Story of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic description of spread complexity and its rate in 2D CFTs, building on the pioneering work \cite{Caputa:2024sux}. By exploiting the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry, we construct the Krylov basis and demonstrate that its non-uniqueness gives rise to ambiguities analogous to those in quantum complexity. Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify the spread complexity as the energy measured by a bulk observer, with its rate corresponding to the radial momentum. These results suggest a novel holographic interpretation of complexity ambiguity: rather than arising from infinitely many gravitational observables, it may reflect the existence of infinitely many observers, each measuring complexity from their own perspective.</description>

      <title>An integrable deformed Landau-Lifshitz model with particle production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the continuum limit of a non-Hermitian deformation of the Heisenberg XXX spin chain. This model appeared in the classification of $4\times4$ solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation and it has the particular feature that the transfer matrix is non-diagonalisable. We show that the model is given by a Drinfeld twist of the XXX spin chain and its continuum limit is a non-unitary deformation of the Landau-Lifshitz model. We compute the tower of conserved charges for this deformed Landau-Lifshitz model and show that they are generated by a boost operator. We furthermore show that it gives a non-vanishing $1\to 2$ S-matrix, where one of the outgoing particles has vanishing energy and momentum, and thus it does not fulfil the usual "no particle production" condition of integrability. We argue that this result is natural when looked from the point of view of the non-diagonalisability of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur partition functions and RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a double-scaled limit of the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) which generalizes the Schur index. The resulting partition function, $\hat {\cal Z}(q,\alpha)$, has a standard $q$-expansion with coefficients depending on a continuous parameter $\alpha$. The Schur index is a special case with $\alpha=1$. Through explicit computations we argue that this partition function is an invariant of certain mass deformations and vacuum expectation value (vev) deformations of the SCFT. In particular, two SCFTs residing in different corners of the same Coulomb branch, satisfying certain restrictive conditions, have the same partition function with a non-trivial map of the parameters, $\hat {\cal Z}_1(q,\alpha_1)=\hat {\cal Z}_2(q,\alpha_2(\alpha_1))$. For example, we show that the Schur index of all the SCFTs in the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c series is given by special values of $\alpha$ of the partition function of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Four-Loop Renormalisation of Chiral Gauge Theories with Non-Anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in the BMHV Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the complete 4-loop renormalisation of an Abelian chiral gauge theory in the Breitenlohner-Maison / `t Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) scheme. Employing a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularisation, we determine the full set of symmetry restoring counterterms from the quantum action principle. Our calculation represents the highest-order application of the BMHV framework so far, pushing the limits of a self-consistent treatment of $\gamma_5$ at the multi-loop level. We describe the computational setup that we developed to perform the computations and discuss key implementation aspects, such as the BMHV algebra and tensor reduction. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying the BMHV scheme at high loop orders and establishes a solid foundation for future studies of high-precision electroweak physics.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ are independent of the model parameters that leads to unresolved degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Implications of DESI for Dark Matter &amp; Cosmic Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Regular Spacetimes in the Effective Metric Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, significant effort has been directed towards developing various regularized models for compact objects. Recently, a new observable-based parametrization was introduced to account for black hole deformations in a model-independent fashion, referred to as the Effective Metric Description (EMD) \cite{Binetti:2022xdi, DelPiano:2023fiw, DelPiano:2024gvw, DelPiano:2024nrl}. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation of the regularity of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes by extending the EMD. We derive the conditions under which curvature scalars remain finite everywhere and the associated spacetime is geodesically complete. Our results are then used to classify the cores of regular spacetimes based on their asymptotic behavior near the origin. To illustrate our findings, we apply our regularity conditions to known black hole examples.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fisher information for a rotating BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Imprint of $\alpha$-clustering on nucleon-nucleon correlations in relativistic light ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of $\alpha$-cluster structures in relativistic light nuclear collisions. Using a cluster framework, the characteristics of the nucleonic configurations of $^{16}$ O and $^{20}$ Ne are extracted as predicted by various \textit{ab initio} models, including Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT), Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). Additionally, I analyze configurations derived from a three-parameter Fermi (3pF) density function. The investigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point correlators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne). The cluster parameters are determined by minimizing the \textit{chi-square} statistic to align the nucleon distributions with those predicted by the mentioned theories. The results reveal that perturbative calculations effectively capture the structural features of these nuclei, while comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations validate these findings. Furthermore, The analysis reveals distinct cluster geometries: VMC suggests tetrahedral shapes, while NLEFT, PGCM, and 3pF indicate irregular triangular pyramids. Notably, NLEFT shows a bowling pin-like $\alpha$ cluster structure for $^{20}$Ne. The study also identifies constraints on cluster parameters in the ground and excited oxygen states, with a gradual increase in $\varepsilon_2\{2\}$ for excited states. Accurate modeling of asymmetric collisions requires a range of nucleons from heavy spherical nuclei, leading to weighted correlators in perturbative calculations. I demonstrate consistency between perturbative calculations and Monte Carlo models, with analytical calculations providing more insights into asymmetric than symmetric collisions.</description>

      <title>Tri-hypercharge versus tri-darkcharge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, ultraviolet-complete, and renormalizable extension of the Standard Model, in which the three generations of ordinary fermions are distinguished by family-dependent hypercharges, while three right-handed neutrinos are separated by a dark gauge symmetry that is trivial for all Standard Model fields. This setup yields a fully flipped inert doublet model. The model naturally realizes a hybrid scotoseesaw mechanism that accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses and the largeness of lepton mixing. Simultaneously, it explains the stability and relic abundance of dark matter through a residual dark parity and addresses the hierarchies of charged fermion masses and the suppression of quark mixing via higher-dimensional operators involving high-scale scalar singlets and vector-like fermions. We explore the phenomenological implications of the model and derive constraints from electroweak precision tests, collider searches, flavor-changing processes, and observations of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Casimir eigenvalues on $ad^{\otimes k}$ of SU(N) are linear on N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalues of the Casimir operator on the naturally defined \textit{stable sequences} of representations of $su(N)$ algebra and prove that eigenvalues are linear over $N$ iff $\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+...+k\lambda_k=\lambda_{N-1}+2\lambda_{N-2}+...+k\lambda_{N-k}$, where $\lambda_i$ are Dynkin labels, and $\lambda_i=0$ for $k&lt;i&lt;N-k$, with fixed $k$. These representations are exactly those which appear in the decomposition of $ad(su(N))^{\otimes k}$, therefore this linearity admits the presentation of eigenvalues in the universal, in Vogel's sense, form, and supports the hypothesis of universal decomposition of $ad^{\otimes k}$ into Casimir eigenspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we study the evolution of energy density fluctuations in the presence of a static and uniform magnetic field. By numerically solving the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation within the relaxation time approximation and performing the momentum mode analysis of different wavelength fluctuations, we show that the magnetic field increases the damping of mode oscillations. This causes a qualitative change in the fluctuations present in the system at the timescale required to achieve a local equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic and Strong Coupling Models in Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the cosmological implications of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a modified gravitational theory formulated from Weyl geometry. The nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is coupled to the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. We analyze two models based on the logarithmic and strong coupling form of the function $f(Q,T)$. The corresponding field equations are then solved numerically after reformulating the system in terms of redshift. We used combined dataset from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon$^+$ supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the model parameters. Using the constrained parameters, the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the models are analyzed. The results successfully describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion for both the models. The models mostly exhibit quintessence-like behavior and asymptotically approach the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at late times. The calculated age of the Universe from each model aligns with constraints from Planck and stellar age data. The violation of the strong energy condition and the satisfaction of null energy condition and dominant energy conditions are shown.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to study integrable deformations of chiral conformal field theories on elliptic curves from the viewpoint of contact algebra. We introduce the relevant integrable condition within the framework of conformal vertex algebra, and derive the contact term relations among certain local operators. We investigate three versions of genus one partition functions and derive the contact equations. This leads to a rigorous formulation of Dijkgraaf's master equation \cite{Dijk1996master} for chiral deformations.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory talks at Moriond QCD and High-Energy Interactions 2025 covered the full range of scales from BSM, top, Higgs, EW, and hard QCD physics, through resummation, factorisation, and PDFs, to hadronic, heavy-ion, nonperturbative, and lattice QCD. A few talks also touched on methodologies. We here summarise main points of most of these contributions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation signatures in the low-energy sector of Ho\v{r}ava gravity from black hole shadow observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Ho\v{r}ava gravity model and EHT observations of supermassive black holes (BHs) to investigate signatures of Lorentz violation in real astrophysical environments. The Lorentz violation in the rotating Ho\v{r}ava BH spacetime are confined to the strong gravitational field region, being induced by the BH's rotation. Due to the non-separability of the photon motion equations in this spacetime, we employed a numerical backward ray-tracing method to generate shadow images for various BH parameters. Subsequently, we extracted coordinate positions characterizing the shadow shape from high-pixel images to evaluate the parameter space of the BH. When evaluating M87*, Lorentz violation can occur with arbitrary strength. However, for Sgr A*, we can impose certain parameter constraints on Lorentz violation. These constraints depend on the BH's spin. If future observations confirm Sgr A*'s spin parameter less than 0.81 at maximum inclination, current EHT results would challenge general relativity and support Lorentz violation in low-energy regimes.</description>

      <title>CALICO: Computing Annihilators from Linear Identities Constraining (differential) Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the method of parametric annihilators for deriving integral relations. Parametric annihilators are differential operators that annihilate multivalued integration kernels appearing in suitable integral representations of special functions. We illustrate this approach in a way that applies to a broad variety of integral representations. We describe a method for computing parametric annihilators based on efficient linear solvers and use them to derive relations between a wide class of special functions related to important problems in high-energy physics. We also formulate a similar method for deriving differential equations satisfied by the independent integrals within an integral family. We show applications to several classes of special functions, including hypergeometric functions, loop integrals in various representations (including Baikov, loop-by-loop Baikov, Lee-Pomeransky and Schwinger representations) and duals of loop integrals. We finally present the public Mathematica package CALICO for computing parametric annihilators and its usage in several examples of high relevance in theoretical particle physics.</description>

Abstract: We provide closed analytic expressions for the Uehling and Serber contributions of the vacuum fluctuations in QED using Meijer G-functions. Our work extends recently found results by offering a novel formulation for the Uehling and Serber potentials and explores their properties in more detail. The form of these potentials is analyzed, and their relevance for precision measurements in experiments is investigated. For the Uehling potential, we connect the solution with the propagation of photons through atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>A guide to frames, $2\pi$'s, scales and corrections in string compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is intended to serve as a reference for conventions used in the literature on string compactifications, and how to move between them, collected in a single and easy-to-find place, using type IIB as an illustrative example. We hope it may be useful to beginners in the field and busy experts. E.g. string constructions proposed to address the moduli stabilisation problem are generically in regions of parameter space at the boundaries of control, so that consistent use of $2\pi$'s and frame conventions can be pivotal when computing their potentially dangerous corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha'$ corrections to near-horizon dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole in a large number of spacetime dimensions $D$ are governed by the worldsheet theory composed of the cigar CFT and the classical sigma model on the sphere at the horizon, along with a timelike-Liouville theory of central charge $26-D$. At leading order in weak string coupling, blackhole thermodynamics is insensitive to the details of timelike Liouville theory. In this limit, we use Lewkowycz-Maldacena-trick motivated infinitesimally off-shell closed string worldsheet formalism in [arxiv: 2310.02313] to calculate thermal entropy exactly in $\alpha'$. The leading term in $\alpha'\to 0$ limit and the first stringy correction of our result are in precise agreement with the target space Callan-Myers-Perry formula.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In JT gravity coupled to a CFT, I argue without using the path integral that the entanglement wedge of a boundary region is bounded by a quantum extremal surface (QES). For any candidate not bounded by a QES, a unitary in the complement can make reconstruction within the candidate inconsistent with boundary causality. The case without islands is a direct consequence of subregion duality, and the case with islands can also be dealt with with a stronger assumption.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of the properties of a holographic superconductor from an anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically an $s$-wave holographic superconductor from an anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with backreaction in the context of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. By introducing a parameter $G$ to tune the effects of the backreaction, we can study non-perturbatively how the condensation and conductivity of the superconductor change as the backreaction increases. We find that for small values of $G$, increasing the nonlinearity of the Born-Infeld model makes the formation of the condensate harder -- consistent with previous results reported in the literature -- while for values of $G$ close to one, the opposite effect occurs; increasing the nonlinearity slightly facilitates its formation. This result is confirmed by making similar studies for the electrical conductivity of the superconductor and the penetration depth of the Meissner effect. Moreover, we analize in detail the superfluid density in these systems. We also determine how the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ varies for different intensities of nonlinearity and backreaction, showing in particular that large deviations from the so-called universal value arise as backreaction becomes stronger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine $1/N$ corrections to a notion of generalized entanglement entropy known as entwinement dual to the length of a winding geodesic in asymptotically AdS$_3$ geometries. We explain how $1/N$ corrections can be computed formally via the FLM formula by relating entwinement to an ordinary entanglement entropy in a fictitious covering space. Moreover, we explicitly compute $1/N$ corrections to entwinement for thermal states and small winding numbers using a monodromy method to determine the corrections to the dominant conformal block for the replica partition function. We also determine a set of universal corrections at finite temperature for large winding numbers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the "entanglement builds geometry" proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

Abstract: We study if and when mod-2 anomalies can be canceled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism with the introduction of an antisymmetric tensor field $B_{\mu\nu}$. As explicit examples, we examine $SU(2)$ and more general $Sp(n)$ gauge theories in four and eight dimensions. We find that the mod-2 anomalies of 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(n)$ gauge theory can be canceled, as expected from it having a string theory realization, while the mod-2 Witten anomaly of 4d $SU(2)$ and $Sp(n)$ gauge theory cannot be canceled in this manner.</description>

      <title>EFT &amp; Species Scale: Friends or foes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the notion that quantum gravity effects could manifest at scales much lower than the Planck scale has seen an intense Swamplandish revival. Dozens of works have explored how the so-called species scale -- at which an effective description of gravity must break down -- relates to String Theory and the Swampland conjectures. In particular, the interplay between this scale and the abundant towers of states becoming lighter in asymptotic regions of moduli spaces has proved to be key in understanding the real scale of quantum gravity. Nevertheless concerns have been raised regarding the validity of using infinite towers of states when estimating this scale within Effective Field Theory and, more precisely, the consistency of cutting the tower part way through in a framework that relies on a clear separation of scales. In this work we take an EFT point-of-view and provide a detailed perturbative derivation of the species scale -- by computing the 1-loop graviton propagator in the presence of many fields -- thereby clarifying common sources of confusion in the literature. Not only do we clarify the setup, assumptions and regimes of validity of the result, but more importantly apply the same methods to an infinite tower of states. We show how each state in the tower contributes to the species scale and how the procedure of counting only ''light fields'' can be compatible with not cutting the tower, thereby maintaining the harmony between infinite towers and EFTs even in the context of the species scale.</description>

      <title>Running EFT-hedron with null constraints at loop level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implications of general properties of quantum field theory, such as causality, unitarity, and locality include constraints on the couplings of the effective field theory (EFT) coefficients. These constraints follow from the connections between the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) theory imposed by dispersion relations for four-particle amplitudes which formally allow us to express EFT couplings through the moments of positive-definite functions (imaginary parts of partial wave amplitudes) forming the EFT-hedron geometry. Previous studies of these positivity bounds were mainly focused on the weakly coupled EFTs, limiting the analysis to tree-level amplitudes of the IR theory. In this work, we extend the scope of positivity bounds including one-loop amplitudes, which is essential especially for the loops of massless particles. Examining a single scalar theory we found that the presence of massless loops cannot be reduced only to the running of EFT couplings because loops modify the crossing symmetry relations (null constraints). Our results demonstrate that while for small coupling constants, the one-loop bounds are in good agreement with the tree-level results, the allowed EFT parameter ranges can be significantly modified if a weak coupling assumption is not additionally imposed. We present the unitarity bounds on dimension-8 and dimension-10 EFT couplings beyond the weak coupling assumption in five and six spacetime dimensions. We discuss the difficulties of obtaining the constraints in forward limit in four dimensions related to the infrared singularities and show how to overcome these problems by constructing finite combinations of null constraints.</description>

Abstract: In the AdS/CFT context, the entanglement of purification (EoP, denoted as $E_{P}$) of CFT is conjectured to be dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) in bulk. However, another quantity called reflected entropy $S_{R}$ is also supposed to be dual to two times the EWCS. A natural question is whether they are the same in holographic CFTs even though they are different in general. Previous studies have shown $E_{P} \ge \frac{1}{2} S_{R}^{(n)}, n \ge2$ for random tensor networks. In this paper, we study this inequality beyond $n \ge 2$, and we focus on the range $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$. However, the calculations of EoP are notoriously difficult in general. Thus, our calculations mainly focus on the free scalar theory which is close to the holographic CFTs. We generalized the previous strategy for EoP in \cite{Takayanagi:2018sbw} to the R\'enyi case. And we have also presented two methods for R\'enyi reflected entropy, one is using correlators, the other one is Gaussian wavefunction ansatz. Our calculations show that the inequality still holds for $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$, and it may give us some insights into the equivalence of EoP and half reflected entropy in holographic CFTs. As byproducts of our research, we have also demonstrated the positivity of the R\'enyi Markov gap and the monotonicity of the R\'enyi reflected entropy in the free scalar theory.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary entanglement correspondence and the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in an $AdS_2/CFT_1$ setup</title>

Abstract: Using recent developments in expressing one-loop partition functions in Euclidean $AdS_2$ space-times in terms of character integrals, we relate the one-loop effective action for a free field theory in $AdS_2$ (comprised of a massless scalar field and a massless Majorana fermion field) to the partition function of the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan (DFF) conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) models on the two global $AdS_2$ boundaries. The equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees in the field theory guarantee that the one-loop calculation is free of all UV divergences except a logarithmic one consistent with the expected entanglement entropy behaviour in a CQM. Via a thermofield double representation, we compute the entanglement entropy between two copies of the $CFT_1$ (CQM), each living near one of the two boundaries of global $AdS_2$, in a state at global time $\tau \rightarrow - \infty$. This entanglement entropy is expressed in terms of the logarithm of the regularised length of a closed particle trajectory infinitesimally near the rim of the Euclidean $AdS_2$ disc. We view this relation between boundary quantum entanglement and a bulk geometrical quantity as the $AdS_2/CFT_1$ version of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture in our setup. The boundary entanglement entropy is equal to 4 times the thermodynamic entropy read off from the regularised one-loop effective action in $AdS_2$. Further, we compute the bulk entanglement entropy associated with black hole horizons in Lorentzian $AdS_2$ and show that it precisely matches the boundary entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $\sigma$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $\sigma$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense.</description>

      <title>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scattering of a graviton on a gravitational atom. By gravitational atom we mean a quantum mechanical system of a gravitational (bound) state of two massive particles, with possibly some boundary conditions (such as bouncing on a table or hanging as a pendulum). We demonstrate the unexpected fact, that the total absorption cross section is universal, it is independent of both the mass of the gravitationally bound particle or of the mass providing the binding potential. We find that the total absorption cross-section is simply proportional to the Planck area, multiplied by a dimensionless, numerical factor. We speculate about the potential for detection of relic gravitons shot noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories-one Lovelock-Horndeski type and one Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet-obtained via a unified mechanism for Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional heterotic string effective action. In the Lovelock-Horndeski case, we also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles and establish a holographic a-theorem. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms, and show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic explorations of regular black holes in pure gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently established in \textit{Phys.Lett.B 861 (2025) 139260} that regular, asymptotically flat black holes exist in pure gravity theories in dimension greater than four. We extend this result to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes and perform bottom-up holographic explorations: Hawking-Page phase transitions, quasinormal modes of black holes providing decay times of excitations in the finite temperature conformal field theory and U-shaped string probes leading to the quark-antiquark potential in the dual field theory. The gravitational action contains a bared, negative cosmological constant and an Einstein-Hilbert term, supplemented by an infinite series of higher-curvature terms of the family known as Quasi-topological (QT) Lagrangians, leading to a lapse function in terms of infinite series which can be resumed to an analytic function for different coupling choices. The QT terms are defined as those satisfying a Birkhoff's theorem and possessing a holographic c-function, and exist at all orders in the curvature, for arbitrary dimension greater than four. Besides presenting the general formulae, we explore the physics of three specific cases leading to Hayward, Dymnikova and Bardeen-like regular black holes. We also found the field redefinition that permits recasting the $\alpha'^3 W^4$ correction of Type IIB supergravity on $\mathcal{A}_5\times S^5$ as a series of QT terms. Before finishing, beyond holography, we also provide an extended thermodynamic setup, that via variations of the dimensionful $\alpha$ and $L$, allow obtaining the Euler relation between finite thermodynamical quantities for the black hole of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We explore the reconstruction of bulk local states in three-dimensional flat spacetime (Flat$_3$) using states from two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT$_2$), proposed as dual field theories in one lower dimension. For massive scalar-type bulk excitations, reconstruction is achieved through states in the induced representation. This method successfully reproduces the bulk massive scalar spectrum and the bulk-to-bulk propagator. Additionally, we identify a new flat limit from AdS$_3$ and dS$_3$ spacetimes, further validating our proposal for scalar reconstruction in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Quantum Gravity in a Closed Lorentzian Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how meaningful physical predictions can arise in nonperturbative quantum gravity in a closed Lorentzian universe. In such settings, recent developments suggest that the quantum gravitational Hilbert space is one-dimensional and real for each $\alpha$-sector, as induced by spacetime wormholes. This appears to obstruct the conventional quantum-mechanical prescription of assigning probabilities via projection onto a basis of states. While previous approaches have introduced external observers or augmented the theory to resolve this issue, we argue that quantum gravity itself contains all the necessary ingredients to make physical predictions. We demonstrate that the emergence of classical observables and probabilistic outcomes can be understood as a consequence of partial observability: physical observers access only a subsystem of the universe. Tracing out the inaccessible degrees of freedom yields reduced density matrices that encode classical information, with uncertainties exponentially suppressed by the environment's entropy. We develop this perspective using both the Lorentzian path integral and operator formalisms and support it with a simple microscopic model. Our results show that quantum gravity in a closed universe naturally gives rise to meaningful, robust predictions without recourse to external constructs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons in the spectrum of propagating particle states, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the computation of $2$-point correlation functions of $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS operators in the $6$d, $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory in the presence of a surface defect. We focus on the protected sector described by the chiral algebra and reproduce its correlators using a bootstrap approach. A unique feature of this calculation is that we can completely determine the answer by using bulk-channel data only. We, also, perform the operator expansion in the defect channel which provide new predictions for the theory.</description>

Abstract: A topological A-model constructed from $CP^{3|4}$ supertwistor variables is proposed for the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring. At zero $AdS$ radius, free N=4 d=4 super-Yang-Mills amplitudes are reproduced by topological amplitudes of the corresponding gauged linear sigma model where the closed superstring vertex operator for a trace of $k$ super-Yang-Mills fields is described by a boundary state with $k$ edges. After turning on a Fayet-Iliopoulis term in the sigma model with coefficient $R^2 =\sqrt{g_{YM}^2 N}$, the topological amplitudes are claimed to reproduce the 't Hooft expansion of perturbative super-Yang-Mills amplitudes. Finally, this topological A-model is related to the usual $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring in the pure spinor formalism.</description>

Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

      <title>Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter\textendash dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and, for the first time, numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions, improving upon earlier works that relied on approximations. We perform a comprehensive MCMC analysis using a combination of datasets including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results show a clear preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling, overcoming previous upper-bound-only constraints due to improved numerical accuracy and data precision. This preference is primarily driven by the late-time ISW effect. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$_0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields strong statistical support over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta{\rm AIC} = -0.75, -2.41$ respectively. If future data further supports a fifth force in the dark sector, non-linear structure formation could offer additional observational tests of such long-range interactions. This work also remains consistent with recent DESI observations of evolving dark energy, with the effective dark energy equation of state crossing the phantom divide around redshift $z \sim 0.5$, a feature that emerges naturally in our framework due to the scalar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schr\"odinger wavefunction representation which we argue to be less appealing. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity, plausibly with a quantum Einstein equation suggested.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity effects on particle creation and evaporation in a non-commutative black hole via mass deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a gravitational non-commutative black hole by gauging the de Sitter SO(4,1) group and employing the Seiberg-Witten map. Specifically, we examine modifications of non-commutativity represented through mass deformation. Initially, we address modifications to Hawking radiation for bosonic particle modes by analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetimes. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, showing how $\Theta$ introduces a correction to the amplitude associated with particle creation. Additionally, we derive the power spectrum and the Hawking temperature within this framework. We also derive Hawking radiation from a tunneling perspective, leading to expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density. A similar analysis is performed for fermion particles. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical expression for black hole evaporation lifetime and compare our results with recent estimates of non-commutativity in the literature.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <title>Reduction to master integrals and transverse integration identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduction of Feynman integrals to a basis of linearly independent master integrals is a pivotal step in loop calculations, but also one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we assess the impact of using transverse integration identities for the reduction to master integrals. Given an integral family, some of its sectors correspond to diagrams with fewer external legs or to diagrams that can be factorized as products of lower-loop integrals. Using transverse integration identities, i.e. a tensor decomposition in the subspace that is transverse to the external momenta of the diagrams, one can map integrals belonging to such sectors and their subsectors to (products of) integrals belonging to new and simpler integral families, characterized by either fewer generalized denominators, fewer external invariants, fewer loops or combinations thereof. Integral reduction is thus drastically simpler for these new families. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the application of transverse integration identities in the context of integral reduction. We include some applications to cutting-edge integral families, showing significant improvements over traditional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In general relativity, gravitational memory describes the lasting change in the separation and relative velocity of freely falling detectors after the passage of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we elucidate the relation between Bondi-Metzner-Sachs transformations at future null infinity and the description of gravitational memory in local synchronous coordinates, commonly used in GW detectors like LISA. We show that gravitational memory corresponds to large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, such as volume-preserving spatial rescalings. We reproduce the associated soft theorems for scattering amplitudes. Finally, we derive novel soft theorems for equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, which are recognized as the flat space analogues of inflationary consistency relations with a soft tensor mode. These relations provide a pathway toward uncovering deeper connections between gravitational memory and cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical approaches to QED scattering in strong fields typically treat the field as a fixed background with simple spacetime dependence, such as a plane wave. Two major challenges are therefore the inclusion of backreaction (e.g. depletion of the field) and spatial geometry (e.g. focussing). We show here that a solution to one problem can solve the other: even if particle wavefunctions in a chosen focussed background are not known, we show they can be constructed once depletion is accounted for. We demonstrate this by giving the exact wavefunctions in a flying focus beam for which all energy is absorbed by particles scattering on it. In addition we use the wavefunctions to obtain a simple expression for the nonlinear Compton scattering amplitude, comparing with the plane wave case. Our methods thus open a new avenue of investigation in which two previously challenging effects are simultaneously brought under analytic control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects make the potential bias between the true and false vacua dependent on the temperature and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Dyonic regular black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We present a new exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations which represents a rotating black hole with both electric and magnetic charges immersed in a universe which itself is also rotating and magnetized, i.e. the dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe. We show that the solution is completely regular and free of any type of singularity; then we analyze its physical properties, such as the ergoregions and the shape of the event horizons. Finally we present the extremal near horizon geometry of the metric and study its entropy via the Kerr/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>The impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurements with the SMOG2 program at LHCb on the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the potential impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurement within the SMOG2 fixed-target program at the LHCb experiment on nuclear parton distribution functions. Following~\cite{Bursche:2018orf}, we assume that SMOG2 will collect data for five nuclear targets: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and hydrogen which will provide a baseline for constructing nuclear ratios. The analysis is performed by using the PDF reweighting method. We demonstrate that such a measurement will allow to considerably reduce the current uncertainties of the nuclear gluon distribution and, to some extent, even the uncertainties of the light sea-quark distributions. Furthermore, it will provide the first possibility to systematically study the current assumptions on the $A$-dependence of the nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A note on the calculation of the Komar integral in the Lorentzian Taub-NUT spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that one can derive consistent thermodynamical expressions in the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime keeping the Misner-string singularities and taking into account their contributions in the Komar integrals. We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure because, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaces which are used in the Komar integrals. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical aspects of fermions in external electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated. As a byproduct, we find an explicit formula for the relative entropy of gauge invariant quasi-free states.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian equations of motion of quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute explicitly the equations of motion of the Hamiltonian formulation of quadratic gravity. This is the theory with the most general Lagrangian with terms of quadratic order in the curvature tensor. We employ the symbolic computational tool Cadabra. We present the linearized version of the equations of motion, performing the longitudinal-transverse decomposition. We compare the linear equations with the covariant field equations, finding that, if general-relativity terms are active, the linear Hamiltonian formulation is valid only if the perturbative spatial metric is traceless, a condition that can be freely imposed by recurring to an arbitrary function. We apply the equations of motion on homogeneous and isotropic configurations, finding explicit solutions.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild perturbations in higher derivative gravity theories in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kerr-Schild perturbations of the ghost-free generic non-local gravity theory constructed infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we present, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for group manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is a reliable and versatile algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It resolves the ergodicity issues commonly encountered in Lefschetz thimble-based approaches at a low computational cost. In this article, as a first step toward applying WV-HMC to lattice QCD, we extend the algorithm to cases where the configuration space is a group manifold. The key idea is to formulate the algorithm using a phase-space integral over the tangent bundle of the worldvolume, which naturally carries a symplectic structure. The validity of this novel algorithm is demonstrated using the one-site model with a purely imaginary coupling constant.</description>
