      <title>Mode of sustainable economic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To implement the previously formulated principles of sustainable economic development, all non-negative solutions of the linear system of equations and inequalities, which are satisfied by the vector of real consumption, are completely described. It is established that the vector of real consumption with the minimum level of excess supply is determined by the solution of some quadratic programming problem. The necessary and sufficient conditions are established under which the economic system, described by the "input-output" production model, functions in the mode of sustainable development. A complete description of the equilibrium states for which markets are partially cleared in the economy model of production "input-output" is given, on the basis that all solutions of system of linear equations and inequalities are completely described. The existence of a family of taxation vectors in the "input-output" model of production, under which the economic system is able to function in the mode of sustainable development, is proved. Restrictions were found for the vector of taxation in the economic system, under which the economic system is able to function in the mode of sustainable development. The axioms of the aggregated description of the economy is proposed.</description>

      <title>Influencer Cartels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media influencers account for a growing share of marketing worldwide. We demonstrate the existence of a novel form of market failure in this advertising market: influencer cartels, where groups of influencers collude to increase their advertising revenue by inflating their engagement. Our theoretical model shows that influencer cartels can improve consumer welfare if they expand social media engagement to the target audience, or reduce welfare if they divert engagement to less relevant audiences. We validate the model empirically using novel data on influencer cartels combined with machine learning tools, and derive policy implications for how to maximize consumer welfare.</description>

      <title>Time Instability of the Fama-French Multifactor Models: An International Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time-varying structure of Fama and French's (1993; 2015) multi-factor models using Fama and MacBeth's (1973) two-step estimation based on the rolling window method. In particular, we employ the generalized GRS statistics proposed by Kamstra and Shi (2024) to examine whether the validity of the risk factors (or factor redundancy) in the FF3 and FF5 models remains stable over time, and investigate whether the manner of portfolio sorting affects the time stability of the validity of the risk factors. In addition, we examine whether the similar results are obtained even when we use different datasets by country and region. First, we find that the effectiveness of factors in the FF3 and FF5 models is not stable over time in all countries. Second, the effectiveness of factors is also affected by the manner of portfolio sorting. Third, the validity of the FF3, FF5, and their nested models do not remain stable over time except for Japan. This suggests that the efficient market hypothesis is supported in the Japanese stock market. Finally, the factor redundancy varies over time and is affected by the manner of portfolio sorting mainly in the U.S. and Europe.</description>
