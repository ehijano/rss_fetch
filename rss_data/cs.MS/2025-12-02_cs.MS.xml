      <title>Making the RANMAR pseudorandom number generator in LAMMPS up to four times faster, with an implementation of jump-ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massively parallel molecular simulations require pseudorandom number streams that are provably non-overlapping and reproducible across thousands of compute units in parallel computing environments. In the widely used LAMMPS package, the standard RANMAR generator lacks a mathematically exact mechanism to jump ahead; distinct seeds are typically assigned instead, which does not ensure disjoint streams. We introduce a mathematically exact jump-ahead extension for RANMAR in LAMMPS. In practice, a single random sequence can be partitioned into consecutive, non-overlapping blocks of length $J$, with one block assigned to each compute unit under formal non-overlap guarantees. In our approach, we develop an algebraic reformulation that enables efficient jump-ahead even for very large $J$ by casting state advancement into polynomial computations over finite residue rings while keeping memory small. We implement the extension in C++ using Number Theory Library (NTL) and integrate it into LAMMPS without altering user workflows. Beyond enabling exact partitioning, converting the 24-bit floating-point recurrence to an equivalent 24-bit integer recurrence accelerates generation itself: across diverse CPUs, generation is approximately two to four times faster than the floating-point baseline. Computing very large jumps (e.g., $J \approx 2^{120}$) remains practical.</description>

      <title>A Matlab code for analysis and topology optimization with Third Medium Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Matlab code for modelling and topology optimization of hyperelastic structures, including contact modelled by the Third Medium Contact (TMC) approach. By using the so-called HuHu-regularization we penalize the skew distortion of the bilinear finite elements discretizing void regions, thus promoting convergence of the nonlinear solver. First, we show how this method is implemented in a compact code, allowing to simulate contact and force transfer in hyperelastic structures. Then, we solve a topology optimization problem for minimum end-compliance of a structure exhibiting contact. The Matlab scripts that replicate the results are included, and we discuss some possible extensions to more general problems.</description>
