      <title>Boosting uniformity in quasirandom groups: fast and simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of multiplying $k\times t$ elements from the group $H=\text{SL}(2,q)$ in the number-on-forehead model with $k$ parties. We prove a lower bound of $(t\log H)/c^{k}$. This is an exponential improvement over previous work, and matches the state-of-the-art in the area.
  Relatedly, we show that the convolution of $k^{c}$ independent copies of a 3-uniform distribution over $H^{m}$ is close to a $k$-uniform distribution. This is again an exponential improvement over previous work which needed $c^{k}$ copies. The proofs are remarkably simple; the results extend to other quasirandom groups.
  We also show that for any group $H$, any distribution over $H^{m}$ whose weight-$k$ Fourier coefficients are small is close to a $k$-uniform distribution. This generalizes previous work in the abelian setting, and the proof is simpler.</description>

      <title>Approximately counting maximal independent set is equivalent to #SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. It is also the key problem of mathematics, computer science, and other fields. A counting problem is a type of computational problem that associated with the number of solutions. Besides, counting problems help us better understand several fields such as algorithm analysis, complexity theory, artificial intelligence, etc. The problem of counting maximal independent sets is #P-complete. So it is natural to think about approximate counting for maximal independent sets problem. In this article, we study the complexity of approximately counting maximal independent sets. Specifically, we are the first to prove that the #MIS problem is AP-interreducible with the #SAT of a given general graph.</description>

      <title>Fast Simulation of Cellular Automata by Self-Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that computing the configuration of any one-dimensional cellular automaton at generation $n$ can be accelerated by constructing and running a composite one with a radius proportional to $\log n$. The new automaton is the original automaton whose local rule function is composed with itself. The asymptotic time complexity to compute the configuration of generation $n$ is reduced from $O(n^2)$ operations to $O(n^2 / \log n)$ on a given machine with $O(n^2)$ memory usage. Experimental results are given in the case of Rule 30.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness Results of the Cardinality-Based Minimum s-t Cut Problem in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hypergraphs an edge that crosses a cut can be split in several ways, depending on how many nodes are placed on each side of the cut. A cardinality-based splitting function assigns a nonnegative cost of $w_i$ for each cut hyperedge $e$ with exactly $i$ nodes on the side of the cut that contains the minority of nodes from $e$. The cardinality-based minimum $s$-$t$ cut aims to find an $s$-$t$ cut with minimum total cost. Assuming the costs $w_i$ are polynomially bounded by the input size and $w_0=0$ and $w_1=1$, we show that if the costs satisfy $w_i &gt; w_{i-j}+w_{j}$ for some $i \in \{2, \ldots \floor*{n/2}\}$ and $j \in \{1,\ldots,\floor*{i/2}\}$, then the problem becomes NP-hard. Our result also holds for $k$-uniform hypergraphs with $k \geq 4$. Additionally, we show that the \textsc{No-Even-Split} problem in $4$-uniform hypergraphs is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Almost-catalytic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for space bounded models with restoration requirements on the space used by the algorithm is an important challenge posed about the catalytic computation model introduced by Buhrman et al. (2014). Motivated by the scenarios where we do not need to restore unless is useful, we define $ACL(A)$ to be the class of languages that can be accepted by almost-catalytic Turing machines with respect to $A$ (which we call the catalytic set), that uses at most $c\log n$ work space and $n^c$ catalytic space.
  We show that if there are almost-catalytic algorithms for a problem with catalytic set as $A \subseteq \Sigma^*$ and its complement respectively, then the problem can be solved by a ZPP algorithm. Using this, we derive that to design catalytic algorithms, it suffices to design almost-catalytic algorithms where the catalytic set is the set of strings of odd weight ($PARITY$). Towards this, we consider two complexity measures of the set $A$ which are maximized for $PARITY$ - random projection complexity (${\cal R}(A)$) and the subcube partition complexity (${\cal P}(A)$).
  By making use of error-correcting codes, we show that for all $k \ge 1$, there is a language $A_k \subseteq \Sigma^*$ such that $DSPACE(n^k) \subseteq ACL(A_k)$ where for every $m \ge 1$, $\mathcal{R}(A_k \cap \{0,1\}^m) \ge \frac{m}{4}$ and $\mathcal{P}(A_k \cap \{0,1\}^m)=2^{m/4}$. This contrasts the catalytic machine model where it is unclear if it can accept all languages in $DSPACE(\log^{1+\epsilon} n)$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
  Improving the partition complexity of the catalytic set $A$ further, we show that for all $k \ge 1$, there is a $A_k \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ such that $\mathsf{DSPACE}(\log^k n) \subseteq ACL(A_k)$ where for every $m \ge 1$, $\mathcal{R}(A_k \cap \{0,1\}^m) \ge \frac{m}{4}$ and $\mathcal{P}(A_k \cap \{0,1\}^m)=2^{m/4+\Omega(\log m)}$.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Unary Exclusive Nondeterministic Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exclusive nondeterministic finite automata (XNFA) are nondeterministic finite automata with a special acceptance condition. An input is accepted if there is exactly one accepting path in its computation tree. If there are none or more than one accepting paths, the input is rejected. We study the descriptional complexity of XNFA accepting unary languages. While the state costs for mutual simulations with DFA and NFA over general alphabets differ significantly from the known types of finite automata, it turns out that the state costs for the simulations in the unary case are in the order of magnitude of the general case. In particular, the state costs for the simulation of an XNFA by a DFA or an NFA are $e^{\theta(\sqrt{n \cdot ln{n}})}$. Conversely, converting an NFA to an equivalent XNFA may cost $e^{\theta(\sqrt{n \cdot ln{n}})}$ states as well. All bounds obtained are also tight in the order of magnitude. Finally, we investigate the computational complexity of different decision problems for unary XNFA and it is shown that the problems of emptiness, universality, inclusion, and equivalence are coNP-complete, whereas the general membership problem is NL-complete.</description>

      <title>Complexity Aspects of the Extension of Wagner's Hierarchy to $k$-Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the Wadge reducibility of regular $\omega$-languages is efficiently decidable (Krishnan et al., 1995), (Wilke, Yoo, 1995). In this paper we study analogous problem for regular k-partitions of $\omega$-languages. In the series of previous papers (Selivanov, 2011), (Alaev, Selivanov, 2021), (Selivanov, 2012) there was a partial progress towards obtaining an efficient algorithm for deciding the Wadge reducibility in this setting as well. In this paper we finalize this line of research providing a quadratic algorithm (in RAM model). For this we construct a quadratic algorithm to decide a preorder relation on iterated posets. Additionally, we discuss the size of the representation of regular $\omega$-languages and suggest a more compact way to represent them. The algorithm we provide is efficient for the more compact representation as well.</description>

      <title>Temporal Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) for every valued structure with the domain ${\mathbb Q}$ that is preserved by all order-preserving bijections. Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};&lt;)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms; this is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend algorithmic conservation inequalities to probability measures. The amount of self information of a probability measure cannot increase when submitted to randomized processing. This includes (potentially non-computable) measures over finite sequences, infinite sequences, and $T_0$, second countable topologies. One example is the convolution of signals over real numbers with probability kernels. Thus the smoothing of any signal due We show that given a quantum measurement, for an overwhelming majority of pure states, no meaningful information is produced.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Problems with Splittings and Interval Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11753v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $n$-way number partitioning problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, with applications to diverse settings such as fair allocation and machine scheduling. All these problems are NP-hard, but various approximation algorithms are known. We consider three closely related kinds of approximations.
  The first two variants optimize the partition such that: in the first variant some fixed number $s$ of items can be \emph{split} between two or more bins and in the second variant we allow at most a fixed number $t$ of \emph{splittings}. The third variant is a decision problem: the largest bin sum must be within a pre-specified interval, parameterized by a fixed rational number $u$ times the largest item size.
  When the number of bins $n$ is unbounded, we show that every variant is strongly {\sf NP}-complete. When the number of bins $n$ is fixed, the running time depends on the fixed parameters $s,t,u$. For each variant, we give a complete picture of its running time.
  For $n=2$, the running time is easy to identify. Our main results consider any fixed integer $n \geq 3$. Using a two-way polynomial-time reduction between the first and the third variant, we show that $n$-way number-partitioning with $s$ split items can be solved in polynomial time if $s \geq n-2$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Also, $n$-way number-partitioning with $t$ splittings can be solved in polynomial time if $t \geq n-1$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Finally, we show that the third variant can be solved in polynomial time if $u \geq (n-2)/n$, and it is {\sf NP}-complete otherwise. Our positive results for the optimization problems consider both min-max and max-min versions.
  Using the same reduction, we provide a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the case where the number of split items is lower than $n-2$.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Hypergraphs Arising in Cellular Mobile Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An assumption that researchers have often used to model interference in a wireless network is the unit disk graph model. While many theoretical results and performance guarantees have been obtained under this model, an open research direction is to extend these results to hypergraph interference models. Motivated by recent results that the worst-case performance of the distributed maximal scheduling algorithm is characterized by the interference degree of the hypergraph, in the present work we investigate properties of the interference degree of the hypergraph and the structure of hypergraphs arising from physical constraints. We show that the problem of computing the interference degree of a hypergraph is NP-hard and we prove some properties and results concerning this hypergraph invariant. We investigate which hypergraphs are realizable, i.e. which hypergraphs arise in practice, based on physical constraints, as the interference model of a wireless network. In particular, a question that arises naturally is: what is the maximal value of $r$ such that the hypergraph $K_{1,r}$ is realizable? We determine this quantity for various integral and nonintegral values of the path loss exponent of signal propagation. We also investigate hypergraphs generated by line networks.</description>
