      <title>A Characterization of Borel Measures which Induce Lipschitz-Free Space Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will solve a problem by Aliaga about Lipschitz-Free spaces (denoted by $\mathcal F(M)$): $$ \text{Does every Borel measure $\mu$ on a complete metric space $M$ such that $\int d(m,0) d |\mu|(m)&lt; \infty$ induce a weak$^*$ continuous functional $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)$ by the mapping $\mathcal L\mu(f)=\int f d \mu$?}$$ In particular, we will show a characterization of the measures such that $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)$, which indeed implies inner-regularity for complete metric spaces, and we will prove that every Borel measure on $M$ induces an element of $\mathcal F(M)$ if and only if the weight of $M$ is strictly less than the least real-valued measurable cardinal, and thus the existence of a metric space on which there is a measure $\mu$ such that $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)^{**} \setminus \mathcal F(M)$ cannot be proven in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of Moran-type measures with staggered contraction ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \{\phi_{k,d}\}_{d\in D_{2p_k}, k\geq 1} $ be a Moran-type iterated function system (IFS) defined by $ \phi_{k,d}(x)=(-1)^d b_k^{-1}(x+d) $, where $ \{b_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}, \{p_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty} $ are the sequences of integer numbers with $ b_k\geq 2p_k\geq 2 $ and $ D_{2p_k}=\{0,1,\dots,2p_k-1\}, k\ge 1$. We first show that the Moran-type IFS induces uniquely a Borel probability measure $ \mu $, then show that the $ \mu $ is a spectral measure provided $ 2p_{k}\mid b_{k} $ for all $ k\geq 2 $. Our result extends the recent works by An and He \cite{An-He2014} and Wu \cite{Wu2024}.</description>

      <title>Polynomially oscillatory multipliers on Gelfand-Shilov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continuity of the multiplier operator $e^{i q}$ acting on Gelfand--Shilov spaces, where $q$ is a polynomial on $\mathbf R^d$ of degree at least two with real coefficients. In the parameter quadrant for the spaces we identify a wedge that depends on the polynomial degree for which the operator is continuous. We also show that in a large part of the complement region the operator is not continuous in dimension one. The results give information on well-posedness for linear evolution equations that generalize the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle.</description>

      <title>Boundary values via reproducing kernels: The Julia-Carath\'eodory theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reproducing kernel $k$ on a nonempty set $X$, we define the reproductive boundary of $X$ with respect to $k$. Furthermore, we generalize the well known nontangential and horocyclic approach regions of the unit circle to this new kind of boundary. We also introduce the concept of a composition factor of $k$, of which contractive multipliers are a special case. Using these notions, we obtain a far reaching generalization of the Julia-Carath\'eodory theorem, stated on an arbitrary set. As an application we prove Julia's lemma in this setting and give sufficient conditions for the convergence of iterates of some self maps. We also improve the classical theorem on the unit disk for contractive multipliers of standard weighted Dirichlet spaces. Many examples and questions are provided for these novel objects of study.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of the (quasi)norm in rearrangement-invariant spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interactions of absolute continuity of the (quasi)norm with the concepts that are fundamental in the theory of rearrangement-invariant (quasi-)Banach function spaces, such as the Luxemburg representation or the Hardy--Littlewood--P{\' o}lya relation. In order to prove our main results, we give an explicit construction of a particularly suitable representation quasinorm (which is not necessarily unique) and develop several new tools that we believe to be of independent interest. As an application of our results, we characterise the subspace of functions having absolutely continuous quasinorms in weak Marcinkiewicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Examples of cyclic polynomially bounded operators that are not similar to contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question if a polynomially bounded operator is similar to a contraction was posed by Halmos and was answered in the negative by Pisier. His counterexample is an operator of infinite multiplicity, while all its restrictions on invariant subspaces of finite multiplicity are similar to contractions. In the paper, cyclic polynomially bounded operators which are not similar to contractions and are quasisimilar to $C_0$-contractions or to isometries are constructed. The construction is based on a perturbation of the sequence of finite dimensional operators which is uniformly polynomially bounded, but is not uniformly completely polynomially bounded, constructed by Pisier.</description>

      <title>Duality, extreme points and hulls for noncommutative partial convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies generalizations of (matrix) convexity, including partial convexity and biconvexity, under the umbrella of $\Gamma$-convexity. Here $\Gamma$ is a tuple of free symmetric polynomials determining the geometry of a $\Gamma$-convex set. The paper introduces the notions of $\Gamma$-operator systems and $\Gamma$-ucp maps and establishes a Webster-Winkler type categorical duality between $\Gamma$-operator systems and $\Gamma$-convex sets. Next, a notion of an extreme point for $\Gamma$-convex sets is defined, paralleling the concept of a free extreme point for a matrix convex set. To ensure the existence of such points, the matricial sets considered are extended to include an operator level. It is shown that the $\Gamma$-extreme points of an operator $\Gamma$-convex set $K$ are in correspondence with the free extreme points of the operator convex hull of $\Gamma(K).$ From this result, a Krein-Milman theorem for $\Gamma$-convex sets follows. Finally, relying on the results of Helton and the first two authors, a construction of an approximation scheme for the $\Gamma$-convex hull of the matricial positivity domain {(also known as a free semialgebraic set)} $D_p$ of a free symmetric polynomial $p$ is given. The approximation consists of a decreasing family of $\Gamma$-analogs of free spectrahedra, whose projections, under mild assumptions, in the limit yield the $\Gamma$-convex hull of $D_p.$</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last twenty years, Lewis Bowen's sofic entropy and its annealed version (originally called the `f-invariant') have taken a central place in the ergodic theory of actions of non-amenable groups. In this work we pursue these notions of entropy across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. We find connections to both classical constructs in operator theory and the study of tuples of independent random unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Iterated relation systems on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For fractals on Riemannian manifolds, the theory of iterated function systems often does not apply well directly, as fractal sets are often defined by relations that are multivalued or non-contractive. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the notion of iterated relation systems. We study the attractor of an iterated relation system and formulate a condition under which such an attractor can be identified with that of an associated graph-directed iterated function system. Using this method, we obtain dimension formulas for the attractor of an iterated relation system under the graph open set condition or the graph finite type condition. This method improves the one in [Ngai-Xu, J. Geom. Anal. {\bf 33} (2023), 262], which relies on knowing the specific structure of the attractor.</description>

      <title>Ces\`{a}ro-like operator acting between Bloch type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a finite positive Borel measure on the interval $[0,1)$ and $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n} \in H(\mathbb{D})$. The Ce\`{a}sro-like operator is defined by $$ \mathcal{C}_\mu(f)(z)=\sum^\infty_{n=0}\mu_n\left(\sum^n_{k=0}a_k\right)z^n, \ z\in \mathbb{D}, $$ where, for $n\geq 0$, $\mu_n$ denotes the $n$-th moment of the measure $\mu$, that is, $\mu_n=\int_{[0, 1)} t^{n}d\mu(t)$. In this paper, we characterize the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{C}_\mu$ is bounded (compact) from one Bloch type space, $\mathcal {B}^{\alpha}$, into another one, $\mathcal {B}^{\beta}$.</description>

      <title>Large-scale behaviour of Sobolev functions in Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behaviour at infinity of $p$-Sobolev functions in the setting of Ahlfors $Q$-regular metric measure spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality. By introducing the notions of sets which are $p$-thin at infinity, we show that functions in the homogeneous space $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ necessarily have limits at infinity outside of $p$-thin sets, when $1\le p&lt;Q&lt;+\infty$. When $p&gt;Q$, we show by example that uniqueness of limits at infinity may fail for functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$. While functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ may not have any reasonable limit at infinity when $p=Q$, we introduce the notion of a $Q$-thick set at infinity, and characterize the limits of functions in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ along infinite curves in terms of limits outside $Q$-thin sets and along $Q$-thick sets. By weakening the notion of a thick set, we show that a function in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ with a limit along such an almost thick set may fail to have a limit along any infinite curve. While homogeneous $p$-Sobolev functions may have infinite limits at infinity when $p\ge Q$, we provide bounds on how quickly such functions may grow: when $p=Q$, functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ have sub-logarithmic growth at infinity, whereas when $p&gt;Q$, such functions have growth at infinity controlled by $d(\cdot, O)^{1-Q/p}$, where $O$ is a fixed base point in $X$. For the inhomogeneous spaces $N^{1,p}(X)$, the phenomenon is different. We show that for $1\le p\le Q$, the limit of a function $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ is zero outside of a $p$-thin set, whereas $\lim_{x\to+\infty}u(x)=0$ for all $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ when $p&gt;Q$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations of Parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretization error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretization in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter--Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups. We apply the abstract framework to an anisotropic diffusion model with random diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Takagi-van der Waerden functions in metric spaces and its Lipschitz derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Takagi--van der Waerden function with parameters $a{&gt;}b{&gt;}0$ by setting $f_{a,b}(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty b^n d\big(x,S_n\big)$, where $S_n$ is a maximal $\frac1{a^n}$-separated set in a metric space $X$. So, if $X=\mathbb R$ and $S_n=\frac1{a^n}\mathbb Z$ then $f_{2,1}$ is the Takagi function and $f_{10,1}$ is the van der Waerden function which are the famous examples of nowhere differentiable functions. Then we prove that the big Lipschitz derivative $\mathrm{Lip} f_{a,b}(x)=+\infty$ if $a&gt;b&gt;2$ and $x$ is a non-isolated point of $X$. Moreover, if the shell porosity $p^s(X,x)&lt;\lambda&lt;1$ for some $\lambda$ and each non-isolated point $x\in X$ then the little Lipschitz derivative $\mathrm{lip} f_{a,b}(x)=+\infty$ for large enough $a&gt;b$ and any non-isolated point $x\in X$. In particular, this is true for any normed space. Finally, we prove that for any open set $A$ in a metric (normed) space $X$ without isolated points there exists a continuous function $f$ such that $\mathrm{Lip} f(x)=+\infty$ (and $\mathrm{lip} f(x)=+\infty$) exactly on $A$.</description>
