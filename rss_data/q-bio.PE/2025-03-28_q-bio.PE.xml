      <title>Value of risk-contact data from digital contact monitoring apps in infectious disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple method to integrate risk-contact data, obtained via digital contact monitoring (DCM) apps, in conventional compartmental transmission models. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many such data have been collected for the first time via newly developed DCM apps. However, it is unclear what the added value of these data is, unlike that of traditionally collected data via, e.g., surveys during non-epidemic times. The core idea behind our method is to express the number of infectious individuals as a function of the proportion of contacts that were with infected individuals and use this number as a starting point to initialize the remaining compartments of the model. As an important consequence, using our method, we can estimate key indicators such as the effective reproduction number using only two types of daily aggregated contact information, namely the average number of contacts and the average number of those contacts that were with an infected individual. We apply our method to the recent COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands, using self-reported data from the health surveillance app COVID RADAR and proximity-based data from the contact tracing app CoronaMelder. For both data sources, our corresponding estimates of the effective reproduction number agree both in time and magnitude with estimates based on other more detailed data sources such as daily numbers of cases and hospitalizations. This suggests that the use of DCM data in transmission models, regardless of the precise data type and for example via our method, offers a promising alternative for estimating the state of an epidemic, especially when more detailed data are not available.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.</description>

      <title>Barrier-Free Microhabitats: Self-Organized Seclusion in Microbial Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria frequently colonize natural microcavities such as gut crypts, plant apoplasts, and soil pores. Recent studies have shown that the physical structure of these spaces plays a crucial role in shaping the stability and resilience of microbial populations (Karita et al., PNAS 2022, Postek et al. PNAS 2024). Here, we demonstrate that protected microhabitats can emerge dynamically, even in the absence of physical barriers. Interactions with surface features -- such as roughness or friction -- lead microbial populations to self-organize into effectively segregated subpopulations. Our numerical and analytical models reveal that this self-organization persists even when strains have different growth rates, allowing slower-growing strains to avoid competitive exclusion. These findings suggest that emergent spatial structuring can serve as a fundamental mechanism for maintaining microbial diversity, despite selection pressures, competition, and genetic drift.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra model with sparse interactions: non-Gaussian effects and topological multiple-equilibria phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium phases of a generalized Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a species interaction matrix which is random, sparse and symmetric. Dynamical fluctuations are modeled by a demographic noise with amplitude proportional to the effective temperature T. The equilibrium distribution of species abundances is obtained by means of the cavity method and the Belief Propagation equations, which allow for an exact solution on sparse networks. Our results reveal a rich and non-trivial phenomenology that deviates significantly from the predictions of fully connected models. Consistently with data from real ecosystems, which are characterized by sparse rather than dense interaction networks, we find strong deviations from Gaussianity in the distribution of abundances. In addition to the study of these deviations from Gaussianity, which are not related to multiple-equilibria, we also identified a novel topological glass phase, present at both finite temperature, as shown here, and at T=0, as previously suggested in the literature. The peculiarity of this phase, which differs from the multiple-equilibria phase of fully-connected networks, is its strong dependence on the presence of extinctions. These findings provide new insights into how network topology and disorder influence ecological networks, particularly emphasizing that sparsity is a crucial feature for accurately modeling real-world ecological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bounds for survival probabilities in supercritical Galton-Watson processes and applications to population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population genetic processes, such as the adaptation of a quantitative trait to directional selection, may occur on longer time scales than the sweep of a single advantageous mutation. To study such processes in finite populations, approximations for the time course of the distribution of a beneficial mutation were derived previously by branching process methods. The application to the evolution of a quantitative trait requires bounds for the probability of survival $\Sn$ up to generation $n$ of a single beneficial mutation. Here, we present a method to obtain a simple, analytically explicit, either upper or lower, bound for $\Sn$ in a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We prove the existence of an upper bound for offspring distributions including Poisson and binomial. They are constructed by bounding the given generating function, $\varphi$, by a fractional linear one that has the same survival probability $\Sinf$ and yields the same rate of convergence of $\Sn$ to $\Sinf$ as $\varphi$. For distributions with at most three offspring, we characterize when this method yields an upper bound, a lower bound, or only an approximation. Because for many distributions it is difficult to get a handle on $\Sinf$, we derive an approximation by series expansion in $s$, where $s$ is the selective advantage of the mutant. We briefly review well-known asymptotic results that generalize Haldane's approximation $2s$ for $\Sinf$, as well as less well-known results on sharp bounds for $\Sinf$. We apply them to explore when bounds for $\Sn$ exist for a family of generalized Poisson distributions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our and of previously derived bounds for $\Sinf$ and $\Sn$. Finally, we treat an application of these results to determine the response of a quantitative trait to prolonged directional selection.</description>

      <title>Sideward contact tracing in an epidemic model with mixing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic epidemic model with sideward contact tracing. We assume that infection is driven by interactions within mixing events (gatherings of two or more individuals). Once an infective is diagnosed, each individual who was infected at the same event as the diagnosed individual is contact traced with some given probability. Assuming few initial infectives in a large population, the early phase of the epidemic is approximated by a branching process with sibling dependencies. To address the challenges given by the dependencies, we consider sibling groups (individuals who become infected at the same event) as macro-individuals and define a macro-branching process. This allows us to derive an expression for the effective macro-reproduction number which corresponds to the effective individual reproduction number and represents a threshold for the behaviour of the epidemic. Through numerical examples, we show how the reproduction number varies with the distribution of the mixing event size, the mean size, the rate of diagnosis and the tracing probability.</description>

      <title>Epidemic models with digital and manual contact tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a Markovian SIR epidemic model where individuals either recover naturally or are diagnosed, leading to isolation and potential contact tracing. Our focus is on digital contact tracing via a tracing app, considering both its standalone use and combination with manual tracing. We prove that as the population size $n$ grows large, the epidemic process converges to a limiting process, which, unlike typical epidemic models, is not a branching process due to dependencies created by contact tracing. However, by grouping to-be-traced individuals into macro-individuals, we derive a multi-type branching process interpretation, allowing computation of the reproduction number $R$. This is then converted to an individual reproduction number $R^{(ind)}$, which, contrary to $R$, decays monotonically with the fraction of app-users while both share the same threshold at 1. Finally, we compare digital (only) contact tracing and manual (only) contact tracing, proving that the critical fraction app-users $\pi_c$ required for $R=1$ is higher than the critical fraction manually contact traced $p_c$ for manual tracing.</description>
