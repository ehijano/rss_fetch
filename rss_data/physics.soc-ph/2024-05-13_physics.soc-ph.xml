      <title>Optimizing Viscous Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous democracy is a generalization of liquid democracy, a social choice framework in which voters may transitively delegate their votes. In viscous democracy, a "viscosity" factor decreases the weight of a delegation the further it travels, reducing the chance of excessive weight flowing between ideologically misaligned voters. We demonstrate that viscous democracy often significantly improves the quality of group decision-making over liquid democracy. We first show that finding optimal delegations within a viscous setting is NP-hard. However, simulations allow us to explore the practical effects of viscosity. Across social network structures, competence distributions, and delegation mechanisms we find high viscosity reduces the chance of "super-voters" attaining large amounts of weight and increases the number of voters that are able to affect the outcome of elections. This, in turn, improves group accuracy as a whole. As a result, we argue that viscosity should be considered a core component of liquid democracy.</description>

      <title>LLM-Augmented Agent-Based Modelling for Social Simulations: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to make significant strides, their better integration into agent-based simulations offers a transformational potential for understanding complex social systems. However, such integration is not trivial and poses numerous challenges. Based on this observation, in this paper, we explore architectures and methods to systematically develop LLM-augmented social simulations and discuss potential research directions in this field. We conclude that integrating LLMs with agent-based simulations offers a powerful toolset for researchers and scientists, allowing for more nuanced, realistic, and comprehensive models of complex systems and human behaviours.</description>

      <title>A Galton Board Approximation Method for Estimating Pedestrian Walking Preferences within Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Galton board approximation method to analyze the potential walking preferences of pedestrians. We employ the binomial distribution to estimate the walking preferences of pedestrians in dynamic crowds. Estimating the probability of the right-side preference $(p)$ based on observational data poses the challenge, as statistical measures such as means and variances often lead to divergent results. This paper aims to explore this issue.</description>

      <title>Colocation of skill related suppliers -- Revisiting coagglomeration using firm-to-firm network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong local clusters help firms compete on global markets. One explanation for this is that firms benefit from locating close to their suppliers and customers. However, the emergence of global supply chains shows that physical proximity is not necessarily a prerequisite to successfully manage customer-supplier relations anymore. This raises the question when firms need to colocate in value chains and when they can coordinate over longer distances. We hypothesize that one important aspect is the extent to which supply chain partners exchange not just goods but also know-how. To test this, we build on an expanding literature that studies the drivers of industrial coagglomeration to analyze when supply chain connections lead firms to colocation. We exploit detailed micro-data for the Hungarian economy between 2015 and 2017, linking firm registries, employer-employee matched data and firm-to-firm transaction data from value-added tax records. This allows us to observe colocation, labor flows and value chain connections at the level of firms, as well as construct aggregated coagglomeration patterns, skill relatedness and input-output connections between pairs of industries. We show that supply chains are more likely to support coagglomeration when the industries involved are also skill related. That is, input-output and labor market channels reinforce each other, but supplier connections only matter for colocation when industries have similar labor requirements, suggesting that they employ similar types of know-how. We corroborate this finding by analyzing the interactions between firms, showing that supplier relations are more geographically constrained between companies that operate in skill related industries.</description>

      <title>Is it getting harder to make a hit? Evidence from 65 years of US music chart history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the creation of the Billboard Hot 100 music chart in 1958, the chart has been a window into the music consumption of Americans. Which songs succeed on the chart is decided by consumption volumes, which can be affected by consumer music taste, and other factors such as advertisement budgets, airplay time, the specifics of ranking algorithms, and more. Since its introduction, the chart has documented music consumerism through eras of globalization, economic growth, and the emergence of new technologies for music listening. In recent years, musicians and other hitmakers have voiced their worry that the music world is changing: Many claim that it is getting harder to make a hit but until now, the claims have not been backed using chart data. Here we show that the dynamics of the Billboard Hot 100 chart have changed significantly since the chart's founding in 1958, and in particular in the past 15 years. Whereas most songs spend less time on the chart now than songs did in the past, we show that top-1 songs have tripled their chart lifetime since the 1960s, the highest-ranked songs maintain their positions for far longer than previously, and the lowest-ranked songs are replaced more frequently than ever. At the same time, who occupies the chart has also changed over the years: In recent years, fewer new artists make it into the chart and more positions are occupied by established hit makers. Finally, investigating how song chart trajectories have changed over time, we show that historical song trajectories cluster into clear trajectory archetypes characteristic of the time period they were part of. The results are interesting in the context of collective attention: Whereas recent studies have documented that other cultural products such as books, news, and movies fade in popularity quicker in recent years, music hits seem to last longer now than in the past.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like states on complex synchronized networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has exposed the idea that interesting quantum-like probability laws, including interference effects, can be manifest in classical systems. Here we propose a model for quantum-like (QL) states and QL bits. We suggest a way that huge, complex systems can host robust states that can process information in a QL fashion. Axioms that such states should satisfy are proposed. Specifically, it is shown that building blocks suited for QL states are networks, possibly very complex, that we defined based on $k$-regular random graphs. These networks can dynamically encode a lot of information that is distilled into the emergent states we can use for QL like processing. Although the emergent states are classical, they have properties analogous to quantum states. Concrete examples of how QL functions are possible are given. The possibility of a `QL advantage' for computing-type operations and the potential relevance for new kinds of function in the brain are discussed and left as open questions.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding a dictionary of pre-selected keywords is crucial for tasks in information retrieval, such as database query and online data collection. Here we propose Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method that uses tools from manifold learning and network science for the data-driven discovery of keywords starting from a seed dictionary. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph derived from word embeddings and the application of local community detection based on graph diffusion to discover semantic neighbourhoods of pre-defined seed keywords. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings and can capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association. We validate our method on a corpus of hate speech-related posts from Reddit and Gab and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords and achieves significantly better performance than threshold methods based on direct word similarities. We further demonstrate the potential of our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on data collected and analysed by domain experts by expanding a conspiracy-related dictionary.</description>

      <title>Node-layer duality in networked systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world networks typically exhibit several aspects, or layers, of interactions among their nodes. By permuting the role of the nodes and the layers, we establish a new criterion to construct the dual of a network. This approach allows to examine information from either a node-centric or layer-centric viewpoint. Through rigorous analytical methods and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that nodewise and layerwise connectivity measure different but related aspects of the same system. Leveraging node-layer duality provides complementary insights, enabling a deeper comprehension of diverse networks across social science, technology and biology. Taken together, these findings reveal previously unappreciated features of complex systems and provide a fresh tool for delving into their structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A simple model of global cascades on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a comprehensive framework that situates information cascade research within the domain of higher-order interactions, utilizing a double-threshold hypergraph model. We propose that individuals (nodes) gain awareness of information through each communication channel (hyperedge) once the number of information adopters surpasses the threshold $\phi_m$. However, actual adoption of the information only occurs when the cumulative influence across all communication channels exceeds a second threshold, $\phi_k$. We analytically derive the cascade condition for both the case of a single seed node using percolation methods and the case of any seed size employing mean-field approximation. Our findings underscore that when considering the fractional seed size, $r_0 \in (0,1]$, the connectivity pattern of the random hypergraph, characterized by the hyperdegree ($k$) and cardinality ($m$) distribution, exerts an asymmetric impact on the global cascade boundary. This asymmetry manifests in the observed differences in the boundaries of the global cascade within the $(\phi_m, \langle m \rangle)$ and $(\phi_k, \langle k \rangle)$ planes. However, as $r_0 \to 0$, this asymmetric effect gradually diminishes. Overall, by elucidating the mechanisms driving information cascades within a broader context of higher-order interactions, our research contributes to theoretical advancements in complex systems theory.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Hidden Citations Obscure True Impact in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: References, the mechanism scientists rely on to signal previous knowledge, lately have turned into widely used and misused measures of scientific impact. Yet, when a discovery becomes common knowledge, citations suffer from obliteration by incorporation. This leads to the concept of hidden citation, representing a clear textual credit to a discovery without a reference to the publication embodying it. Here, we rely on unsupervised interpretable machine learning applied to the full text of each paper to systematically identify hidden citations. We find that for influential discoveries hidden citations outnumber citation counts, emerging regardless of publishing venue and discipline. We show that the prevalence of hidden citations is not driven by citation counts, but rather by the degree of the discourse on the topic within the text of the manuscripts, indicating that the more discussed is a discovery, the less visible it is to standard bibliometric analysis. Hidden citations indicate that bibliometric measures offer a limited perspective on quantifying the true impact of a discovery, raising the need to extract knowledge from the full text of the scientific corpus.</description>
