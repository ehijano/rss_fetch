      <title>Geographic variability in reanalysis wind speed biases: A high-resolution bias correction approach for UK wind energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reanalysis datasets have become indispensable tools for wind resource assessment and wind power simulation, offering long-term and spatially continuous wind fields across large regions. However, they inherently contain systematic wind speed biases arising from various factors, including simplified physical parameterizations, observational uncertainties, and limited spatial resolution. Among these, low spatial resolution poses a particular challenge for capturing local variability accurately. Whereas prevailing industry practice generally relies on either no bias correction or coarse, nationally uniform adjustments, we extend and thoroughly analyse a recently proposed spatially resolved, cluster-based bias correction framework. This approach is designed to better account for local heterogeneity and is applied to 319 wind farms across the United Kingdom to evaluate its effectiveness. Results show that this method reduced monthly wind power simulation errors by more than 32% compared to the uncorrected ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The method is further applied to the MERRA-2 dataset for comparative evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for different reanalysis products. In contrast to prior studies, which rarely quantify the influence of topography on reanalysis biases, this research presents a detailed spatial mapping of bias correction factors across the UK. The analysis reveals that for wind energy applications, ERA5 wind speed errors exhibit strong spatial variability, with the most significant underestimations in the Scottish Highlands and mountainous areas of Wales. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for geographic variability when correcting reanalysis wind speeds, and provide new insights into region-specific bias patterns relevant for high-resolution wind energy modelling.</description>

      <title>Gradient-descent-based reconstruction for muon tomography based on automatic differentiation in PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon scattering tomography is a well-established, non-invasive imaging technique using cosmic-ray muons. Simple algorithms, such as PoCA (Point of Closest Approach), are often utilized to reconstruct the volume of interest from the observed muon tracks. However, it is preferable to apply more advanced reconstruction algorithms to efficiently use the sparse muon statistics that are available. One approach is to formulate the reconstruction task as a likelihood-based problem, where the material properties of the reconstruction volume are treated as an optimization parameter.
  In this contribution, we present a reconstruction method based on directly maximizing the underlying likelihood using automatic differentiation within the PyTorch framework. We will introduce the general idea of this approach, and evaluate its advantages over conventional reconstruction methods. Furthermore, first reconstruction results for different scenarios will be presented, and the potential that this approach inherently provides will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Poissonian Analysis of Glitches Observed in the LIGO Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the temporal distribution of glitches detected by LIGO, focusing on the morphological classification provided by the Gravity Spy project. Starting from the hypothesis that these events follow a Poisson process, we developed a statistical methodology to evaluate the agreement between the empirical distribution of glitches and an ideal Poisson model, using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as the main metric. The analysis was applied to real data from the LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford throughout the O3 run, as well as to synthetic datasets generated from pure Poisson distributions. The results show that while several morphologies exhibit good agreement with the proposed model, classes such as 1400Ripples, Fast Scattering, and Power Line display significant deviations ($R^2 \leq 0.6$), suggesting that their origins do not strictly follow Poissonian statistics. In some cases, a dependence on the detector or the observing run was also observed. This analysis provides a quantitative basis for distinguishing glitch classes based on their degree of "Poissonness", potentially supporting the development of more effective glitch mitigation strategies in gravitational wave detector data.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Neural Network Performance and Interpretability of Quantum Wavefunction Probability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>From sectorial coarse graining to extreme coarse graining of S&amp;P 500 correlation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Pearson Correlation Matrix of stock returns and from the desire to obtain a reduced number of parameters relevant for the dynamics of a financial market, we propose to take the idea of a sectorial matrix, which would have a large number of parameters, to the reduced picture of a real symmetric $2 \times 2$ matrix, extreme case, that still conserves the desirable feature that the average correlation can be one of the parameters. This is achieved by averaging the correlation matrix over blocks created by choosing two subsets of stocks for rows and columns and averaging over each of the resulting blocks. Averaging over these blocks, we retain the average of the correlation matrix. We shall use a random selection for two equal block sizes as well as two specific, hopefully relevant, ones that do not produce equal block sizes. The results show that one of the non-random choices has somewhat different properties, whose meaning will have to be analyzed from an economy point of view.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering shallow water equations from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New data-driven methods have advanced the discovery of governing equations from observations, enabling parsimonious models for complex systems. Here, we 'rediscover' a shallow-water equation closely related to Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) using only video recordings of solitons in a simple flume. Two fundamentally different approaches -- weak-form sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (WSINDy) and a novel Fourier-multiplier method -- recover the same PDE, demonstrating that the equation is inherent in the data and robust to the choice of method. Both identify the same terms with comparable magnitudes and errors. To validate the models, we solve the discovered equations forward in time and compare them with additional experimental cases that were not used in the discovery. Based on the results, we discuss absolute and cumulative errors, as well as the strengths and limitations of the two discovery approaches. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of equation discovery from everyday experiments ('GoPro physics') and highlight shallow-water waves as an ideal test bed for developing and benchmarking new methods.</description>
