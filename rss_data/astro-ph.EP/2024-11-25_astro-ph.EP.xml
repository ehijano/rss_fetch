      <title>He awa whiria: the tidal streams of interstellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys are likely to discover a new sample of interstellar objects (ISOs) within the Solar System, but questions remain about the origin and distribution of this population within the Galaxy. ISOs are ejected from their host systems with a range of velocities, spreading out into tidal streams - analogous to the stellar streams routinely observed from the disruption of star clusters and dwarf galaxies. We create a simulation of ISO streams orbiting in the Galaxy, deriving a simple model for their density distribution over time. We then construct a population model to predict the properties of the streams in which the Sun is currently embedded. We find that the number of streams encountered by the Sun is quite large, ~ 10^6 or more. However, the wide range of stream properties means that for reasonable future samples of ISOs observed in the Solar System, we may see ISOs from the same star ("siblings"), and we are likely to see ISOs from the same star cluster ("cousins"). We also find that ISOs are typically not traceable to their parent star, though this may be possible for ISO siblings. Any ISOs observed with a common origin will come from younger, dynamically colder streams.</description>

      <title>Telescope-to-Fireball Characterization of Earth Impactor 2022 WJ1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing how an asteroid appears in space to its ablation behavior during atmospheric passage and finally to the properties of associated meteorites represents the ultimate probe of small near-Earth objects. We present observations from the Lowell Discovery Telescope and from multiple meteor camera networks of 2022 WJ1, an Earth impactor which was disrupted over the North American Great Lakes on 19 November 2022. As far as we are aware, this is only the second time an Earth impactor has been specifically observed in multiple passbands prior to impact to characterize its composition. The orbits derived from telescopic observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and ground-based meteor cameras result in impact trajectories that agree to within 40 meters, but no meteorites have been found as of yet. The telescopic observations suggest a silicate-rich surface, and thus a moderate-to-high albedo, which results in an estimated size for the object of just D = 40 - 60 cm. Modeling the fragmentation of 2022 WJ1 during its fireball phase also suggests an approximate half-meter original size for the object as well as an ordinary chondrite-like strength. These two lines of evidence both support that 2022 WJ1 was likely an S-type condritic object and the smallest asteroid compositionally characterized in space. We discuss how best to combine telescopic and meteor camera datasets, how well these techniques agree, and what can be learned from studies of ultra-small asteroids.</description>

      <title>Ionization chemistry in the inner disc: a combined treatment of ionic and thermionic emission and arbitrary grain size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, ionization chemistry controls the fluid viscosity, and is thus key to understanding various accretion, outflow and planet formation processes. The ionization is driven by thermal and non-thermal processes in the gas-phase, as well as by dust-gas interactions that lead to grain charging and ionic and thermionic emission from grain surfaces. The latter dust-gas interactions are moreover a strong function of the grain size distribution. However, analyses of chemical networks that include ionic/thermionic emission have so far only considered grains of a single size (or only approximately treated the effects of a size distribution), while analyses that include a distribution of grain sizes have ignored ionic/thermionic emission. Here, we: (1) investigate a general chemical network, widely applicable in inner disc regions, that includes gas-phase reactions, ionic and thermionic emission, and an arbitrary grain size distribution; (2) present a numerical method to solve this network in equilibrium; and (3) elucidate a general method to estimate the chemical time-scale. We show that: (a) approximating a grain size distribution by an "effective dust-to-gas ratio" (as done in previous work) can predict significantly inaccurate grain charges; and (b) grain charging significantly alters grain collisional time-scales in the inner disc. For conditions generally found in the inner disc, this work facilitates: (i) calculation of fluid resistivities and viscosity; and (ii) inclusion of the effect of grain charging on grain fragmentation and coagulation (a critical effect that is often ignored).</description>

      <title>Pebble Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pebble accretion refers to the growth of planetary bodies through the accretion of pebble-sized particles. Pebbles are defined in terms of their aerodynamically size $\tau_s$, which describes the level of coupling to the disk gas. Observations confirms the presence of pebble-sized particles in both protoplanetary disks and the early solar system. Pebble accretion proceeds through the settling mechanism, where particles settle to the surface of the planet. This Chapter discusses the key aspects of the pebble accretion framework: the accretion regimes, the planet initiation mass, and the planet isolation masses. The accretion behavior of loosely coupled $\tau_s &gt; 1$ particles, referred to as "large pebbles", is also examined. The pebble accretion probability, $\epsilon$, is shown to be a useful parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the process, though this quantity is not necessarily high. Distinctions between pebble and planetesimal accretion are outlined. Pebble accretion, in particular, can be a highly effective mechanism in dense rings, as witnessed with ALMA.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes ($\Delta\Pi_{1}$), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars' evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>The Moon-forming Impact as a Constraint for the Inner Solar System's Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar system planets are benchmarks for the planet formation theory. Yet two paradigms coexist for the four terrestrial planets: the prolonged collisional growth among planetesimals lasting $&gt;100$ million years (Myr) and the fast formation via planetesimals accreting pebbles within 10 Myr. Despite their dramatic difference, we can hardly tell which theory is more relevant to the true history of the terrestrial planets' formation. Here, we show that the Moon's origin puts stringent constraints on the pebble accretion scenario, rendering it less favourable. In the pebble accretion model, the one-off giant impact between proto-Earth and Theia rarely (probability $&lt;$ 1\textperthousand) occurs at the right timing and configuration for the Moon formation. Even if a potential impact happens by chance, giant impact simulations reveal perfect mixing between proto-Earth and Theia, leaving no room for the observed primordial Earth mantle heterogeneity and the compositional difference, though small, between Earth and the Moon. Thus, the Earth-Moon system along other terrestrial planets should preferably form from chaotic collisional growth in the inner solar system.</description>

      <title>Radii, masses, and transit-timing variations of the three-planet system orbiting the naked-eye star TOI-396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-396 is an F6V star ($V\approx6.4$) orbited by three transiting planets. The orbital periods of the two innermost planets are close to the 5:3 commensurability ($P_b \sim3.6$ d and $P_c \sim6.0$ d). To measure the masses of the three planets, refine their radii, and investigate whether planets b and c are in MMR, we carried out HARPS RV observations and retrieved photometric data from TESS. We extracted the RVs via a skew-normal fit onto the HARPS CCFs and performed an MCMC joint analysis of the Doppler measurements and transit photometry, while employing the breakpoint method to remove stellar activity from the RV time series. We also performed a thorough TTV dynamical analysis of the system. Our analysis confirms that the three planets have similar sizes: $R_b=2.004_{-0.047}^{+0.045}R_{\oplus}$; $R_c=1.979_{-0.051}^{+0.054}R_{\oplus}$; $R_d=2.001_{-0.064}^{+0.063}R_{\oplus}$. For the first time, we determine RV masses for TOI-396b and d: $M_b=3.55_{-0.96}^{+0.94}M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_b=2.44_{-0.68}^{+0.69}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and $M_d=7.1\pm1.6M_{\oplus}$ ($\rho_d=4.9_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$ g cm$^{-3}$). Our results suggest a quite unusual system architecture, with the outermost planet being the densest. The Doppler reflex motion induced by TOI-396c remains undetected in our RV time series, likely due to the proximity of $P_c$ to the star's rotation period ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}=6.7\pm1.3$ d). We also discovered that TOI-396b and c display significant TTVs. While the TTV dynamical analysis returns a formally precise mass for TOI-396c ($M_{c,\mathrm{dyn}}=2.24^{+0.13}_{-0.67}M_{\oplus}$), the result might not be accurate owing to the poor sampling of the TTV phase. We also conclude that TOI-396b and c are close to-, but out of- the 5:3 MMR. Our numerical simulation suggests TTV semi-amplitudes of up to 5 hours over a temporal baseline of $\sim$5.2 years.</description>

      <title>Potential habitability of present-day Mars subsurface for terrestrial-like methanogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense debate about the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere has stimulated the study of methanogens adapted to terrestrial habitats that mimic Martian environments. We examinate the environmental conditions, energy sources and ecology of terrestrial methanogens thriving in deep crystalline fractures, sub-sea hypersaline lakes and subglacial water bodies considered as analogs of a hypothetical habitable Martian subsurface. We combine this information with recent data on the distribution of buried water or ice and radiogenic elements on Mars and with models of the subsurface thermal regime of this planet to identify a 4.3-8.8 km-deep regolith habitat at the mid-latitude location of Acidalia Planitia, that might fit the requirements for hosting putative Martian methanogens analogous to the methanogenic families Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomicrobiaceae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deploy a newly-generated set of geometric albedo spectral grids to examine the detectability of methane (CH4) in the reflected-light spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet at visible and near-infrared wavelengths with a future exoplanet imaging mission. By quantifying the detectability as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and molecular abundance, we can constrain the best methods of detection with the high-contrast space-based coronagraphy slated for the next generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We used 25 bandpasses between 0.8 and 1.5 microns. The abundances range from a modern-Earth level to an Archean-Earth level, driven by abundances found in available literature. We constrain the optimal 20%, 30%, and 40% bandpasses based on the effective SNR of the data, and investigate the impact of spectral confusion between CH4 and H2O on the detectability of each one. We find that a modern-Earth level of CH4 is not detectable, while an Archean Earth level of CH4 would be detectable at all SNRs and bandpass widths. Crucially, we find that CH4 detectability is inversely correlated with H2o abundance, with required SNR increasing as H2O abundance increases, while H2O detectability depends on CH4 abundance and selected observational wavelength, implying that science requirements for the characterization of Earth-like planet atmospheres in the VIS/NIR should consider the abundances of both species in tandem.</description>

      <title>PDS 70b Shows Stellar-like Carbon-to-Oxygen Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sim$5 Myr PDS 70 is the only known system with protoplanets residing in the cavity of the circumstellar disk from which they formed, ideal for studying exoplanet formation and evolution within its natal environment. Here we report the first spin constraint and C/O measurement of PDS 70b from Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy. We detected CO (3.8 $\sigma$) and H$_2$O (3.5 $\sigma$) molecules in the PDS 70b atmosphere via cross-correlation, with a combined CO and H$_2$O template detection significance of 4.2 $\sigma$. Our forward model fits, using BT-Settl model grids, provide an upper limit for the spin-rate of PDS 70b ($&lt;$29 km s$^{-1}$). The atmospheric retrievals constrain the PDS 70b C/O ratio to ${0.28}^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ ($&lt;$0.63 under 95$\%$ confidence level) and a metallicity [C/H] of ${-0.2}^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ dex, consistent with that of its host star. The following scenarios can explain our measured C/O of PDS 70b in contrast with that of the gas-rich outer disk (for which C/O $\gtrsim$ 1). First, the bulk composition of PDS 70b might be dominated by dust+ice aggregates rather than disk gas. Another possible explanation is that the disk became carbon-enriched $\textit{after}$ PDS 70b was formed, as predicted in models of disk chemical evolution and as observed in both very low mass star and older disk systems with $\textit{JWST}$/MIRI. Because PDS 70b continues to accrete and its chemical evolution is not yet complete, more sophisticated modeling of the planet and the disk, and higher quality observations of PDS 70b (and possibly PDS 70c), are necessary to validate these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Protosolar D-to-H abundance and one part-per-billion PH$_{3}$ in the coldest brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coldest Y spectral type brown dwarfs are similar in mass and temperature to cool and warm ($\sim$200 -- 400 K) giant exoplanets. We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of $\sim$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH$_{3}$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH$_{3}$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>Non-Gravitational Forces in Planetary Systems</title>

Abstract: Non-gravitational forces play surprising and, sometimes, centrally important roles in shaping the motions and properties of small planetary bodies. In the solar system, the morphologies of comets, the delivery of meteorites and the shapes and dynamics of asteroids are all affected by non-gravitational forces. In exoplanetary systems and debris disks, non-gravitational forces affect the lifetimes of circumstellar particles and feed refractory debris to the photospheres of the central stars. Unlike the gravitational force, which is a simple function of the well known separations and masses of bodies, the non-gravitational forces are frequently functions of poorly known or even unmeasurable physical properties. Here, we present order-of-magnitude descriptions of non-gravitational forces, with examples of their application.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency spaceborne radar perspective of deep convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global numerical weather models are starting to resolve atmospheric moist convection which comes with a critical need for observational constraints. One avenue for such constraints is spaceborne radar which tend to operate at three wavelengths, Ku-, Ka- and W-band. Many studies of deep convection in the past have primarily leveraged Ku-band because it is less affected by attenuation and multiple scattering. However, future spaceborne radar missions might not contain a Ku-band radar and thus considering the view of convection from Ka-band or W-band compared to the Ku-band would be useful. This study examines a coincident dataset between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission and CloudSat as well as the entire GPM record to compare convective characteristics across various wavelengths within deep convection. We find that W-band reflectivity (Z) tends to maximize near the Ku-band defined echo-top while Ka-band often maximizes 4-5 km below. The height of the maximum Z above the melting level for W-band does not linearly relate to the Ku-band maximum. However, using the full GPM record the Ka-band 30 dBZ echo-tops can be linearly related to the Ku-band 40 dBZ echo-top with an $R^2$ of 0.62 and a root mean squared error of about 1 km. The spatial distribution of echo-tops from Ka-band corresponds well to the Ku-band echo-tops, highlighting regions of relatively large ice water path. This paper suggests that Ka-band only missions, like NASA's Investigation for Convective Updrafts, should be able to characterize global convection in a similar manner to a Ku-band system.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Cascade adaptive optics with a second stage based on a Zernike wavefront sensor for exoplanet observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the high-contrast observation of disks and gas giant planets around nearby stars has been made possible on ground-based instruments using extreme adaptive optics (XAO). While these facilities produce images with a Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and high-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which impede the study of fainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage based on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing solution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations are expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and moderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage that relies on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. We implemented the cascade AO with a ZWFS-based control loop on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the scheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our second-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric residuals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a gain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path aberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with a Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of our scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop. In addition, it may prove useful for imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging conditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control loop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an effective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO system for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>
