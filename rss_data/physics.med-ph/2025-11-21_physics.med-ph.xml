      <title>The Emory Optic Nerve Head Atlas - Using 3D Anatomical Mapping to Study Optic Neuropathies with an Initial Focus on Glaucoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop the first 3D optic nerve head (ONH) atlas using AI-based registration and evaluate its use in: (1) atlas-adjusted retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis for glaucoma diagnosis, and (2) strain-based assessment of glaucoma severity. Methods: Large-scale OCT datasets were registered using REFLECTIVITY-generated tissue segmentations. A healthy atlas (n=460) and glaucoma atlases for mild (n=852), moderate (n=640), and severe (n=546) disease were built using an AI-driven algorithm incorporating structural and biomechanical constraints. Atlas quality was evaluated using inter-layer contrast and agreement between warped scans and the template. Atlas-adjusted RNFL thickness was extracted by mapping fixed 1.5 mm BMO-based reference points from the atlas to each subject and compared with standard subject-specific RNFL measurements. Effective strain relative to each atlas was computed by morphing subjects to the atlas template. Strain and thickness features were used to classify glaucoma severity. Results: The healthy atlas captured normative ONH anatomy, while glaucoma atlases showed stage-dependent changes. Registration accuracy was high (NCC=0.86+-0.05; Dice=0.90+-0.02), with strong inter-layer contrast (0.40+-0.03). Atlas-adjusted RNFL thickness improved separation between healthy and mild glaucoma (Cohen's d=0.77 vs. 0.72). Classification using atlas-adjusted profiles outperformed native measurements (AUC=0.771 vs. 0.757). Mean effective strain differed significantly across severity groups (ANOVA p&lt;0.05), and CNNs trained on strain maps achieved strong classification (AUC=0.79). Conclusion: The ONH atlas provides a population-derived structural reference enabling anatomically consistent thickness mapping and strain-based characterization. It enhances diagnostic discrimination, supports severity classification, and offers a framework to study glaucomatous biomechanics.</description>

      <title>PySERA: Open-Source Standardized Python Library for Automated, Scalable, and Reproducible Handcrafted and Deep Radiomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics enables the extraction of quantitative biomarkers from medical images for precision modeling, but reproducibility and scalability remain limited due to heterogeneous software implementations and incomplete adherence to standards. Existing tools also lack unified support for deep learning based radiomics. To address these limitations, we introduce PySERA, an open source, Python native, standardized radiomics framework designed for automation, reproducibility, and seamless AI integration. PySERA reimplements the MATLAB based SERA platform within a modular, object oriented architecture and computes 557 features, including 487 Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) compliant features, 10 moment invariant descriptors, and 60 diagnostic features, together with deep learning radiomics embeddings from pretrained networks such as ResNet50, DenseNet121, and VGG16. The framework provides standardized preprocessing, including resampling, discretization, and normalization, multi format image input and output, adaptive memory management, and a parallel multicores extraction engine. PySERA integrates natively with major machine learning ecosystems including scikit learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, MONAI and others. In IBSI benchmarks, PySERA achieved more than 94 percent reproducibility and outperformed PyRadiomics while closely matching MITK. Across eight public datasets, it achieved predictive accuracies ranging from 0.54 to 0.87, consistently exceeding PyRadiomics. PySERA unifies handcrafted and deep learning radiomics in a transparent, scalable, and extensible Python framework, establishing a robust foundation for reproducible, AI ready imaging research.</description>

      <title>The First In Vitro and In Vivo Validation of the Hessian-Free Ray-Born Inversion for Quantitative Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first experimental validation of a Hessian-free ray-Born inversion technique for quantitative reconstruction of sound speed from transmission ultrasound data. The method combines single-scattering theory with high-frequency approximations, yielding an inversion framework well suited to the frequency ranges used in clinical ultrasound applications. Unlike previous singly-scattered inversion approaches that account for medium heterogeneities only in the scattering potential, the proposed ray-Born method employs Green's functions approximated along ray trajectories determined by high-frequency assumptions. The associated objective function is linearized and minimized sequentially across increasing frequency bands. At each frequency set, the linearized subproblem is solved using a weighting scheme applied to both the solution and data spaces, which diagonalizes the Hessian and enables its inversion in a single step. The method, previously reported and released as an open-source package, was applied to in-vitro and in-vivo datasets provided by the University of Rochester Medical Center. The reconstructed images were evaluated by comparison with those obtained using a full-wave inversion approach based on a frequency-domain Helmholtz solver. The results demonstrate the strong potential of the Hessian-free ray-Born inversion as a computationally efficient and accurate method suitable for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation - bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Developing an Agent-Based Mathematical Model for Simulating Post-Irradiation Cellular Response: A Crucial Component of a Digital Twin Framework for Personalized Radiation Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present the Physical-Bio Translator, an agent-based simulation model designed to simulate cellular responses following irradiation. This simulation framework is based on a novel cell-state transition model that accurately reflects the characteristics of irradiated cells. To validate the Physical-Bio Translator, we performed simulations of cell phase evolution, cell phenotype evolution, and cell survival. The results indicate that the Physical-Bio Translator effectively replicates experimental cell irradiation outcomes, suggesting that digital cell irradiation experiments can be conducted via computer simulation, offering a more sophisticated model for radiation biology. This work lays the foundation for developing a robust and versatile digital twin at multicellular or tissue scales, aiming to comprehensively study and predict patient responses to radiation therapy.</description>

      <title>Seeing More, Treating Smarter: Role of Long-Axial Field-of-View PET-CT in The Evolution of Theranostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT has the potential to redefine the role of molecular imaging in theranostics by making multiparametric whole-body (MPWB) imaging and predictive dosimetry more clinically feasible. Compared to conventional PET systems, LAFOV scanners provide dramatic gains in sensitivity and coverage, allowing dynamic acquisitions, delayed imaging, and dual-tracer protocols within clinically feasible workflows. These advances supply the quantitative data required for physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and the creation of theranostic digital twins, supporting true personalization of radiopharmaceutical therapy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing efficiency in paediatric brain tumour segmentation using a pathologically diverse single-center clinical dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children, encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG, medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT), T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2 alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.</description>
