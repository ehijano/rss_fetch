      <title>Heteroclinic for a 6-dimensional reversible system occuring in orthogonal domain walls in convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A six-dimensional reversible normal form system occurs in B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection between parallel planes, when we look for domain walls intersecting orthogonally (see Buffoni et al [1]). On the truncated system, we prove analytically the existence, local uniqueness, and analyticity in parameters, of a heteroclinic connection between two equilibria, each corresponding to a system of convective rolls. We prove that the 3-dimensional unstable manifold of one equilibrium, intersects transversally the 3-dimensional stable manifold of the other equilibrium, both manifolds lying on a 5-dimensional invariant manifold. We also study the linearized operator along the heteroclinic, allowing to prove (in [9]) the persistence under reversible perturbation, of the heteroclinic obtained in [1].</description>

      <title>Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. In this study, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic formulations of variational thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a metriplectic reformulation of the Lagrangian variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We prove that solutions to these constrained variational principles can be generated by the sum of a classic Poisson bracket and a metriplectic 4-bracket, that takes the Hamiltonian and the entropy as generators. We study different cases: simple systems, discrete systems, Euler-Poincar\'e reduced systems and systems with no symplectic part. Several example are shown, including infinite dimensional problems arising from continuum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically establish the mathematical foundation for the $\text{U}^N(1)$ quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of mixed states Explicitly, we present a description based on the $\text{U}^N(1)$ principal bundle and derive a Pythagorean-like distance decomposition equation. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive comparison of its properties with those of the U(1) principal bundle description of the pure-state QGT. Finally, we prove a fundamental inequality for the $\text{U}^N(1)$ QGT and discuss its physical implication.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Principles for Biophysics and Neuroscience: Entropy Production, Bayesian Mechanics &amp; the Free-Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.</description>

      <title>The BV construction for finite spectral triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents how the BV formalism naturally inserts in the framework of noncommutative geometry for gauge theories induced by finite spectral triples. Reaching this goal entails that not only all the steps of the BV construction, from the introduction of ghost/anti-ghost fields to the construction of the BRST complex, can be expressed using noncommutative geometric objects, but also that the method to go from one step in the construction to the next one has an intrinsically noncommutative geometric nature. Moreover, we prove that both the classical BV and BRST complexes coincide with another cohomological theory, naturally appearing in noncommutative geometry: the Hochschild complex of a coalgebra. The construction is presented in detail for $U(n)$-gauge theories induced by spectral triples on the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal BCOV theory is a classical field theory which describes a subclass of deformations of the category of perfect complexes on a Calabi-Yau variety. We compute minimal models for $L_\infty$-algebras describing minimal BCOV theory and its variants on flat space and find that they give certain $L_\infty$-extensions of the infinite-dimensional simple Lie superalgebra $\operatorname{SHO}(d|d)$. We apply this computation to compare an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ action on an odd two-dimensional central extension of $\operatorname{SHO}(3|3)$ first discovered by Kac to an action of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on a variant of minimal BCOV theory previously found by the authors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol that accounts for fundamental practical challenges, including chromatic dispersion, time measurement uncertainty, and dark counts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of these physical phenomena on QKD efficiency, offering practical strategies for enhancing the robustness and security of quantum communication systems in real-world applications. In particular, by manipulating the chirp parameter of single-photon wave packets, we demonstrate significant improvements in key generation rates and an extended range of secure communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>On two systems of Burger's type arising in nonlinear wave interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study the well-posedness of two systems of Burgers type arising in nonlinear wave interactions. The first model describes the interaction of a Burger's bore with the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation while the second exemplify the interaction of weak sound waves and entropy waves with small amplitudes. For the former, we show the local existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces and Wiener-type spaces. For the latter, we provide an elementary proof of finite time singularity.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.</description>

      <title>Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order modeling using stable learned differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) are essential for dynamics prediction in multi-query applications where access to the source of the underlying full order model (FOM) is unavailable; that is, FOM is a black-box. This article proposes a learn-then-project approach for nonintrusive model reduction. In the first step of this approach, high-dimensional stable sparse learned differential operators (S-LDOs) are determined using the generated data. In the second step, the ordinary differential equations, comprising these S-LDOs, are used with suitable dimensionality reduction and low-dimensional subspace projection methods to provide equations for the evolution of reduced states. This approach allows easy integration into the existing intrusive ROM framework to enable nonintrusive model reduction while allowing the use of Petrov-Galerkin projections. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated for Galerkin and LSPG projection-based ROMs through three numerical experiments: 1-D advection equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicate that the proposed nonintrusive ROM strategy provides accurate and stable dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Birkhoff-Gustavson normal forms and spectral asymptotics for nearly resonant Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of near resonances for harmonic approximations of semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators is introduced and explored. Combined with a natural extension of the Birkhoff-Gustavson normal form, we obtain formulas for approaching the discrete spectrum of such operators which are both accurate and easy to implement. We apply the theory to the physically important case of the near Fermi 1:2 resonance, for which we propose explicit expressions and numerical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, the residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with random Hurst exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine two stochastic processes with random parameters, which in their basic versions (i.e., when the parameters are fixed) are Gaussian and display long range dependence and anomalous diffusion behavior, characterized by the Hurst exponent. Our motivation comes from biological experiments, which show that the basic models are inadequate for accurate description of the data, leading to modifications of these models in the literature through introduction of the random parameters. The first process, fractional Brownian motion with random Hurst exponent (referred to as FBMRE below) has been recently studied, while the second one, Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with random exponent (RL FBMRE) has not been explored. To advance the theory of such doubly stochastic anomalous diffusion models, we investigate the probabilistic properties of RL FBMRE and compare them to those of FBMRE. Our main focus is on the autocovariance function and the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) of the processes. Furthermore, we analyze the second moment of the increment processes for both models, as well as their ergodicity properties. As a specific case, we consider the mixture of two point distributions of the Hurst exponent, emphasizing key differences in the characteristics of RL FBMRE and FBMRE, particularly in their asymptotic behavior. The theoretical findings presented here lay the groundwork for developing new methods to distinguish these processes and estimate their parameters from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lorentz surfaces and s-embeddings I: isothermic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S-embeddings were introduced by Chelkak as a tool to study the conformal invariance of the thermodynamic limit of the Ising model. Moreover, Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh introduced a lift of s-embeddings to Lorentz space, and showed that in the limit the lift converges to a maximal surface. They posed the question whether there are s-embeddings that lift to maximal surfaces already at the discrete level, before taking the limit. This paper is the first in a two paper series, in which we answer that question in the positive. In this paper we introduce a correspondence between s-embeddings (incircular nets) and congruences of touching Lorentz spheres. This geometric interpretation of s-embeddings enables us to apply the tools of discrete differential geometry. We identify a subclass of s-embeddings -- isothermic s-embeddings -- that lift to (discrete) S-isothermic surfaces, which were introduced by Bobenko and Pinkall. S-isothermic surfaces are the key component that will allow us to obtain discrete maximal surfaces in the follow-up paper. Moreover, we show here that the Ising weights of an isothermic s-embedding are in a subvariety.</description>

      <title>The charge gap is greater than the neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

Abstract: We consider a basis of square integrable functions on a rectangle, contained in $R^2$, constructed with Legendre polynomials, suitable, for instance, for the analogical description of images on the plane or in other fields of application of the Legendre polynomials in higher dimensions. After extending the Legendre polynomials to any arbitrary interval of the form [a,b], from its original form on [-1,1], we generalize the basis of Legendre polynomials to two dimensions. This is the first step to generalize the basis to n-dimensions. We present some mathematical constructions such as Gelfand triples appropriate on this context. ``Smoothness'' of functions on space of test functions and some other properties are revisited, as well as te continuity of generators of $su(1,1)$ on this context.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is real, $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, and additionally invariant under the symmetry group of the square. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [27, 28]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Symmetry-breaking perturbations and induced band topology are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of fixed-time models in which the commutations relations of a Dirac field with a bosonic field are non-trivial and depend on the choice of a given distribution ("twisting factor"). If the twisting factor is fundamental solution of a differential operator, then applying the differential operator to the bosonic field yields a generator of the local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. Charged vectors generated by the Dirac field define states of the bosonic field which in general are not local excitations of the given reference state. The Hamiltonian density of the bosonic field presents a non-trivial interaction term: besides creating and annihilating bosons, it acts on momenta of fermionic wave functions. When the twisting factor is the Coulomb potential, the bosonic field contributes to the divergence of an electric field and its Laplacian generates local gauge transformations of the Dirac field. In this way we get a fixed-time model fulfilling the equal time commutation relations of the interacting Coulomb gauge.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of F-cohomological field theories and F-topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define F-topological recursion (F-TR) as a non-symmetric version of topological recursion, which associates a vector potential to some initial data. We describe the symmetries of the initial data for F-TR and show that, at the level of the vector potential, they include the F-Givental (non-linear) symmetries studied by Arsie, Buryak, Lorenzoni, and Rossi within the framework of F-manifolds. Additionally, we propose a spectral curve formulation of F-topological recursion. This allows us to extend the correspondence between semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs) and topological recursion, as established by Dunin-Barkowski, Orantin, Shadrin, and Spitz, to the F-world. In the absence of a full reconstruction theorem \`a la Teleman for F-CohFTs, this demonstrates that F-TR holds for the ancestor vector potential of a given F-CohFT if and only if it holds for some F-CohFT in its F-Givental orbit. We turn this into a useful statement by showing that the correlation functions of F-topological field theories (F-CohFTs of cohomological degree 0) are governed by F-TR. We apply these results to the extended 2-spin F-CohFT. Furthermore, we exhibit a large set of linear symmetries of F-CohFTs, which do not commute with the F-Givental action.</description>

Abstract: Given a weighted toroidal graph, each realization to a Euclidean torus is associated with the Dirichlet energy. By minimizing the energy over all possible Euclidean structures and over all realizations within a fixed homotopy class, one obtains a harmonic map into an optimal Euclidean torus. We show that only with this optimal Euclidean structure, the harmonic map and the edge weights are induced from a weighted Delaunay decomposition.</description>

      <title>Prediction of dynamical systems from time-delayed measurements with self-intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of predicting the behaviour of chaotic systems, Schroer, Sauer, Ott and Yorke conjectured in 1998 that if a dynamical system defined by a smooth diffeomorphism $T$ of a Riemannian manifold $X$ admits an attractor with a natural measure $\mu$ of information dimension smaller than $k$, then $k$ time-delayed measurements of a one-dimensional observable $h$ are generically sufficient for $\mu$-almost sure prediction of future measurements of $h$. In a previous paper we established this conjecture in the setup of injective Lipschitz transformations $T$ of a compact set $X$ in Euclidean space with an ergodic $T$-invariant Borel probability measure $\mu$. In this paper we prove the conjecture for all (also non-invertible) Lipschitz systems on compact sets with an arbitrary Borel probability measure, and establish an upper bound for the decay rate of the measure of the set of points where the prediction is subpar. This partially confirms a second conjecture by Schroer, Sauer, Ott and Yorke related to empirical prediction algorithms as well as algorithms estimating the dimension and number of required delayed measurements (the so-called embedding dimension) of an observed system. We also prove general time-delay prediction theorems for locally Lipschitz or H\"older systems on Borel sets in Euclidean space.</description>

Abstract: The Hartree-Fock equation admits homogeneous states that model infinitely many particles at equilibrium. We prove their asymptotic stability in large dimensions, under assumptions on the linearised operator. Perturbations are moreover showed to scatter to linear waves. We obtain this result for the equivalent formulation of the Hartree-Fock equation in the framework of random fields. The main novelty is to study the full Hartree-Fock equation, including for the first time the exchange term in the study of these stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Super Weil-Petersson measures on the moduli space of curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The super Weil-Petersson metric defined over the moduli space of smooth super curves produces a natural measure over the moduli space of smooth curves. The construction of the measure uses the extra data of a spin structure on each smooth curve. When we allow marked points, the construction produces a collection of measures indexed by the behaviour of the spin structure at marked points -- Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond. In this paper we define these measures, and prove that they are finite. Each total measure gives the super volume of the moduli space of super curves with marked points. The Neveu-Schwarz volumes are polynomials that satisfy a recursion relation discovered by Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion relations between Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces. We prove here that the Ramond boundary behaviour produces deformations of the Neveu-Schwarz volume polynomials, satisfying a variant of the Stanford-Witten recursion relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Anomalous random flights and time-fractional run-and-tumble equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random flights (also called run-and-tumble walks or transport processes) represent finite velocity random motions changing direction at any Poissonian time. These models in d-dimension, can be studied giving a general formulation of the problem valid at any spatial dimension. The aim of this paper is to extend this general analysis to time-fractional processes arising from a non-local generalization of the kinetic equations. The probabilistic interpretation of the solution of the time-fractional equations leads to a time-changed version of the original transport processes. The obtained results provides a clear picture of the role played by the time-fractional derivatives in this kind of random motions. They display an anomalous behavior and are useful to describe several complex systems arising in statistical physics and biology. In particular, we focus on the one-dimensional random flight, called telegraph process, studying the time-fractional version of the classical telegraph equation and providing a suitable interpretation of its stochastic solutions.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of solutions of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. Equivalently, we can represent all the joint moments of power sum linear statistics of a certain determinantal point process behind this problem in terms of derivatives of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' transcendents. This gives an efficient way to compute all these quantities explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits containing only symmetry-respecting gates. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. These constraints typically include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while 2-qubit gates are semi-universal for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries in qubit systems, SU(d) symmetry with $d\ge 3$ requires 3-qudit gates for semi-universality. Failure of semi-universality precludes the distribution generated by the random circuits from being even a 2-design for the Haar distribution over symmetry-respecting unitaries. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions, satisfied by U(1) and SU(2) for example, the distribution becomes a $t$-design for $t$ growing polynomially with the number of qudits, where the degree is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum integer $t_{\max}$ for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a $t$-design for all $t\leq t_{\max}$. Notably, for U(1), SU(2) and cyclic groups, we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ as a function of the number of qubits and locality of the gates, and for SU(d), we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ for up to $4$-qudit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples, and discuss the implications of these results for the $3+1$ formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>STEGR in Internal-Space Formulation: Formalisms, Primary Constraints, and Possible Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Time-Translation-Invariant Systems: Conjugate Symplectic Structure, Uncertainty Bounds, and Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear time-translation-invariant (LTI) models offer simple, yet powerful, abstractions of complex classical dynamical systems. Quantum versions of such models have so far relied on assumptions of Markovianity or an internal state-space description. We develop a general quantization scheme for multimode classical LTI systems that reveals their fundamental quantum noise, is applicable to non-Markovian scenarios, and does not require knowledge of an internal description. The resulting model is that of an open quantum LTI system whose dilation to a closed system is characterized by elements of the conjugate symplectic group. Using Lie group techniques, we show that such systems can be synthesized using frequency-dependent interferometers and squeezers. We derive tighter Heisenberg uncertainty bounds, which constrain the ultimate performance of any LTI system, and obtain an invariant representation of their output noise covariance matrix that reveals the ubiquity of "complex squeezing" in lossy systems. This frequency-dependent quantum resource can be hidden to homodyne and heterodyne detection and can only be revealed with more general "symplectodyne" detection. These results establish a complete and systematic framework for the analysis, synthesis, and measurement of arbitrary quantum LTI systems.</description>
