      <title>Statistical applications of the 20/60/20 rule in risk management and portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the applications of the 20/60/20 rule-a heuristic method that segments data into top-performing, average-performing, and underperforming groups-in mathematical finance. We review the statistical foundations of this rule and demonstrate its usefulness in risk management and portfolio optimization. Our study highlights three key applications. First, we apply the rule to stock market data, showing that it enables effective population clustering. Second, we introduce a novel, easy-to-implement method for extracting heavy-tail characteristics in risk management. Third, we integrate spatial reasoning based on the 20/60/20 rule into portfolio optimization, enhancing robustness and improving performance. To support our findings, we develop a new measure for quantifying tail heaviness and employ conditional statistics to reconstruct the unconditional distribution from the core data segment. This reconstructed distribution is tested on real financial data to evaluate whether the 20/60/20 segmentation effectively balances capturing extreme risks with maintaining the stability of central returns. Our results offer insights into financial data behavior under heavy-tailed conditions and demonstrate the potential of the 20/60/20 rule as a complementary tool for decision-making in finance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Investment Strategies Through Market Classification and Volatility: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a dynamic investment framework to enhance portfolio management in volatile markets, offering clear advantages over traditional static strategies. Evaluates four conventional approaches : equal weighted, minimum variance, maximum diversification, and equal risk contribution under dynamic conditions. Using K means clustering, the market is segmented into ten volatility-based states, with transitions forecasted by a Bayesian Markov switching model employing Dirichlet priors and Gibbs sampling. This enables real-time asset allocation adjustments. Tested across two asset sets, the dynamic portfolio consistently achieves significantly higher risk-adjusted returns and substantially higher total returns, outperforming most static methods. By integrating classical optimization with machine learning and Bayesian techniques, this research provides a robust strategy for optimizing investment outcomes in unpredictable market environments.</description>
