      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first-passage properties of a jump process with constant drift where jump amplitudes and inter-arrival times follow arbitrary light-tailed distributions with smooth densities. Using a mapping to an effective discrete-time random walk, we identify three regimes determined by the drift strength: survival (weak drift), absorption (strong drift), and critical. We derive explicit expressions for exponential decay rates in the survival and absorption regimes, and characterize algebraic decay at the critical point. We also obtain asymptotic behavior of the mean first-passage time, number of jumps, and their variances for processes starting either close to the origin or far from it.</description>

      <title>Transitions driven by multibody interactions in an effective model of active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When out-of-equilibrium particles interact by means of pairwise forces, their stationary distribution in general exhibits many-body interactions. In the particular case of active particles, it has been shown numerically that the Motility Induced Phase Separation cannot be explained by the effective attraction emerging from two isolated particles, thereby highlighting the role of multibody interactions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of the Fox-UCNA approximation for active particles interacting by means of pairwise repulsive forces. Working at large space dimension we establish that multibody interactions up to infinite order are instrumental in giving rise to such collective phenomena as phase transitions. We recover a MIPS-like first order transition, but also find a liquid-liquid transition at somewhat lower persistence times. This new transition is connected to a spin glass phase of orientational-like degrees of freedom with disordered interactions set by the particle positions themselves.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient quantum Stirling engine using multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, quantum Stirling engines based on monolayer, AB-stacked bilayer, and ABC-stacked trilayer graphene under perpendicular magnetic fields are analyzed. Performance maps of the useful work \((\eta W)\) reveal a robust optimum at low magnetic fields and moderately low temperatures, with all stackings capable of reaching Carnot efficiency under suitable configurations. The AB bilayer achieves this across the broadest parameter window while sustaining finite work, the monolayer exhibits highly constrained regimes, and the trilayer shows smoother trends with sizable \(\eta W\). These results identify multilayer graphene, particularly the AB bilayer, as a promising platform for efficient Stirling engines, while also highlighting the versatility of the monolayer in realizing all four operational regimes of the Stirling cycle.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in first passage times and utility of resetting protocol in biochemical systems with two-state toggling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interesting theoretical problems of target search or threshold crossing, formally known as {\it first passage}, often arise in both diffusive transport problems as well as problems of chemical reaction kinetics. We study three systems following different chemical kinetics, and are special as they {\it toggle between two states}: (i) a population dynamics of cells with auto-catalytic birth and intermittent toxic chemical-induced forced death, (ii) a bond cluster model representing membrane adhesion to extracellular matrix under a fluctuating load, and (iii) a model of gene transcription with a regulated promoter switching between active and inactive states. Each of these systems has a target state to attain, which defines a first passage problem -- namely, population becoming extinct, complete membrane detachment, or mRNA count crossing a threshold. We study the fluctuations in first passage time and show that it is interestingly {\it non-monotonic} in all these cases, with increasing strength of bias towards the target. We also study suitable {\it stochastic resetting} protocols to expedite first passage for these systems, and show that there is a re-entrant transition of the efficacy of this protocol in all the three cases, as a function of the bias. The exact analytical condition for these transitions predicted in earlier literature is verified here through simulations.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of cluster-based Haldane and bound-magnon states in a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-1 Heisenberg diamond chain in a magnetic field using a combination of analytical and numerical methods including the variational approach, exact diagonalization, density-matrix renormalization group, localized-magnon theory, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for tensor factorization by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Committors without Descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18018v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of nonmonotonic quantum natural gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role.
  Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics.
  While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quantization of information-theoretic quantities introduces inherent arbitrariness.
  To resolve this ambiguity, monotonicity has been used as a guiding principle for constructing geometries in physics, as it aligns with physical intuition.
  Recently, a variant of QNG, which we refer to as nonmonotonic QNG in this paper, was proposed by relaxing the monotonicity condition.
  It was shown to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional QNG.
  In this paper, we investigate the properties of nonmonotonic QNG.
  To ensure the paper is self-contained, we first demonstrate that the SLD metric is locally optimal under the monotonicity condition and that non-monotone quantum Fisher metrics can lead to faster convergence in QNG.
  Previous studies primarily relied on a specific type of quantum divergence and assumed that density operators are full-rank.
  Here, we explicitly consider an alternative quantum divergence and extend the analysis to non-full-rank cases.
  Additionally, we explore how geometries can be designed using Petz functions, given that quantum Fisher metrics are characterized through them.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations comparing different quantum Fisher metrics in the context of parameter estimation problems in quantum circuit learning.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Resolved by Loop Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.</description>

      <title>Coherence-induced deep thermalization transition in random permutation quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a phase transition in the projected ensemble - the collection of post-measurement wavefunctions of a local subsystem obtained by measuring its complement. The transition emerges in systems undergoing random permutation dynamics, a type of quantum time evolution wherein computational basis states are shuffled without creating superpositions. It separates a phase exhibiting deep thermalization, where the projected ensemble is distributed over Hilbert space in a maximally entropic fashion (Haar-random), from a phase where it is minimally entropic ("classical bit-string ensemble"). Crucially, this deep thermalization transition is invisible to the subsystem's density matrix, which always exhibits thermalization to infinite-temperature across the phase diagram. Through a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we show that the transition is tuned by the total amount of coherence injected by the input state and the measurement basis, and is exhibited robustly across different microscopic models. Our findings represent a novel form of ergodicity-breaking universality in quantum many-body dynamics, characterized not by a failure of regular thermalization, but rather by a failure of deep thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the R\'enyi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Overparametrization bends the landscape: BBP transitions at initialization in simple Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional non-convex loss landscapes play a central role in the theory of Machine Learning. Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with gradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed light on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus on a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase Retrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized settings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the Hessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) transition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the initialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a teacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can bend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the information-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization limit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical predictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N behavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N corrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates for a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization becomes entirely uninformative.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>Inheritance entropy quantifies epigenetic regulation of cell-cycle exit in human bone marrow stromal cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) include skeletal stem cells with ground-breaking therapeutic potential. However, BMSC colonies have very heterogeneous in vivo behaviour, due to their different potency; this unpredictability is the greatest hurdle to the development of skeletal regeneration therapies. Colony-level heterogeneity urges a fundamental question: how is it possible that one colony as a collective unit behaves differently from another one? If cell-to-cell variability were just an uncorrelated random process, a million cells in a transplant-bound colony would be enough to yield statistical homogeneity, hence washing out any colony-level traits. A possible answer is that the differences between two originating cells are transmitted to their progenies and collectively persist through an hereditary mechanism. But non-genetic inheritance remains an elusive notion, both at the experimental and at the theoretical level. Here, we prove that heterogeneity in the lineage topology of BMSC clonal colonies is determined by heritable traits that regulate cell-cycle exit. The cornerstone of this result is the definition of a novel entropy of the colony, which measures the hereditary ramifications in the distribution of inactive cells across different branches of the proliferation tree. We measure the entropy in 32 clonal colonies, obtained from single-cell lineage tracing experiments, and show that in the greatest majority of clones this entropy is decisively smaller than that of the corresponding non-hereditary lineage. This result indicates that hereditary epigenetic factors play a major role in determining cycle exit of bone marrow stromal cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18623v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Markov and stationary stochastic process described by the well-known classical master equation, we introduce complex transition rates instead of real transition rates to study the pre-thermal oscillatory behaviour in complex probabilities. Further, for purely imaginary transition rates we obtain persistent infinitely long lived oscillations in complex probability whose nature depends on the dimensionality of the state space. We also take a peek into cases where we perturb the relaxation matrix for a dichotomous process with an oscillatory drive where the relative sign of the angular frequency of the drive decides whether there will be dissipation in the complex probability or not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of overdamped systems weakly driven by time-dependent protocols while interacting with viscoelastic heat baths. Using a generalized Langevin equation with memory, we derive the conditions under which the friction kernel ensures thermodynamic consistency, notably requiring the addition of a Dirac delta. Within linear response theory, we compute the relaxation function and relaxation time for two classes of protocols: moving and stiffening harmonic traps. Surprisingly, we find that viscoelastic memory does not always hinder relaxation; in certain cases, it accelerates it by reducing the effective relaxation time, leading to lower dissipation. We also derive optimal protocols that minimize the irreversible work and show how they are modified by the presence of the persistence time of the viscoelastic heat bath. Our results reveal that memory effects in the overdamped regime leave measurable thermodynamic signatures, depending on the protocol, with direct implications for controlling complex systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Relations associated to an arbitrary bijection in path space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Nonequilibrium Criticality in Run-and-Tumble Particles with Competing Motility and Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propulsion in run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) generates effective attractive interactions that can drive motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), a phenomenon absent in passive systems. Here, we investigate RTPs in the presence of explicit attractive interactions and show that, at high motility, such interactions can suppress MIPS, yielding a homogeneous phase. Upon further increasing the attraction strength, phase separation reappears, giving rise to a re-entrant transition. We characterize this transition by analyzing the percolation properties of dense clusters, which provide geometric signatures of phase separation. Along the resulting critical line, we find continuously varying critical exponents, while certain scaling functions remain unchanged and coincide with those of equilibrium lattice gas models undergoing interacting percolation, which is in the Ising-percolation universality class. These results reveal that the MIPS transition in interacting RTP systems exhibit Ising superuniversality, thereby establishing a connection between nonequilibrium active matter and classical critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In a monitored quantum circuit, regarded as a quantum channel, extensive and positive coherent information is sustained at low measurement rates, protected by the scrambling dynamics. However, noise suppresses coherent information, driving it to zero or negative values. Here, we show that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations facilitates reliable quantum information transmission even in the presence of noise, as evidenced by a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. We provide both analytical understanding and numerical evidence demonstrating this transition, which is modulated by the relative frequencies of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. Additionally, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition in experiments, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum circuit. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production rate of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. In particular, we show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the measurements respect the symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the crucial role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is readily adaptable for investigating symmetry's influence across diverse probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the concept of activity itself. In this Letter, we achieve two distinct, yet complementary main results. First, we introduce a general definition of dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling, which reveals the breakdown of standard KURs at strong coupling. Second, we prove a novel uncertainty relation valid at arbitrary coupling strength, which we denote Quantum KUR (QKUR). This QKUR corresponds to a nontrivial quantum extension of KUR, involving fundamental contributions of the generalized dynamical activity. These two achievements provide a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis, in close analogy with the transition from TURs to QTURs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302]. Explicit steady-state expressions are obtained within Green's-function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</description>

Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu &lt; 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.</description>
