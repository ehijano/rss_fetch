      <title>Hydromangetic shock waves in a cold weakly collisional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the topic of existence of hydrodynamic shock waves in a cold weakly collisional plasma. For this purpose we consider the well established Adlam-Allen model with the addition of a dashpot term associated with the dissipation of the motion of the electrons relative to the ions. We establish the connection between this model and the Korteweg-de-Vries Burgers equation via an asymptotic multiscale analysis. This fact suggests the possibility that this system may support shock wave solutions. Accordingly, by considering a corresponding dynamical system arising through a co-traveling frame reduction, we identify such orbits via a phase-plane analysis. We then leverage such initial conditions within systematic simulations of the original modified Adlam-Allen model, revealing a variety of supported robust wavefronts depending on the magnitude of the dissipation considered.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on polymerized membranes: a coarse-grained lattice modelling with internal degree of freedom for polymer direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study Turing patterns (TPs) on two-dimensional surfaces with a square boundary in ${\bf R}^3$ using a surface model for polymerized membranes. The variables used to describe the membranes correspond to two distinct degrees of freedom: an internal degree of freedom for the polymer directions in addition to the positional degree of freedom. This generalised surface model enables us to identify a non-trivial interference between the TP system and the membranes. To this end, we employ a hybrid numerical technique, utilising Monte Carlo updates for membrane configurations and discrete time iterations for the FitzHugh-Nagumo type Turing equation. The simulation results clearly show that anisotropies in the mechanical deformation properties, particularly the easy axes associated with the stretching and bending of the membranes, determine the direction of the TPs to be perpendicular or parallel to the easy axes. Additionally, by calculating the dependence of the maximum entropy on the internal degree of freedom, we can obtain information on the relaxation with respect to the polymer structure. This crucial information serves to remind us that non-equilibrium configurations can be captured within the canonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>On-chip multi-timescale spatiotemporal optical synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>
