      <title>A Process for Reviewing Design Science Research Papers to Enhance Content Knowledge &amp; Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most published Information Systems research are of the behavioral science research (BSR) category rather than the design science research (DSR) category. This is due in part to the BSR orientation of many IS doctoral programs, which often do not involve much technical courses. This includes IS doctoral programs that train Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) researchers. Without such technical knowledge many doctoral and postdoctoral researchers will not feel confident in engaging in DSR research. Given the importance of designing artifacts that are appropriate for a given context, an important question is how can ICT4D and other IS researchers increase their IS technical content knowledge and intimacy with the DSR process. In this paper we present, a process for reviewing DSR papers that has as its objectives: enhancing technical content knowledge, increasing knowledge and understanding of approaches to designing and evaluating IS/IT artifacts, and facilitating the identification of new DSR opportunities. This process has been applied for more than a decade at a USA research university.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Factors Paper-Reviewer Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in paper submissions to academic conferences, the need for automated and accurate paper-reviewer matching is more critical than ever. Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission. Experiments on four datasets (one of which is newly contributed by us) spanning various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, and data mining consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Chain-of-Factors model in comparison with state-of-the-art paper-reviewer matching methods and scientific pre-trained language models.</description>
