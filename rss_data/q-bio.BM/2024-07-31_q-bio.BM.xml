      <title>ToF-SIMS data analysis of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of bacterial biofilms is particularly challenging and important with diverse applications from systems biology to biotechnology. Among the variety of techniques that have been applied, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has many promising features in studying the surface characteristics of biofilms. ToF-SIMS offers high spatial resolution and high mass accuracy, which permit surface sensitive analysis of biofilm components. Thus, ToF-SIMS provides a powerful solution to addressing the challenge of bacterial biofilm analysis. This dataset covers ToF-SIMS analysis of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 isolated from freshwater lake sediment in New York state. The MR-1 strain is known to have metal and sulfur reducing properties and it can be used for bioremediation and wastewater treatment. There is a current need to identify small molecules and fragments produced from bacterial biofilms. Static ToF-SIMS spectra of MR-1 were obtained using an IONTOF TOF.SIMS V instrument equipped with a 25 keV Bi3+ metal ion gun. Identified molecules and molecular fragments are compared against known biological databases and the reported peaks have at least 65 ppm mass accuracy. These molecules range from lipids and fatty acids to flavonoids, quinolones, and other naturally occurring organic compounds. It is anticipated that the spectral identification of key peaks will assist detection of metabolites, extracellular polymeric substance molecules like polysaccharides, and biologically relevant small molecules using ToF-SIMS in future surface and interface research.</description>

      <title>Compact assessment of molecular surface complementarities enhances neural network-aided prediction of key binding residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting interactions between biomolecules, such as protein-protein complexes, remains a challenging problem. Despite the many advancements done so far, the performances of docking protocols are deeply dependent on their capability of identify binding regions. In this context, we present a novel approach that builds upon our previous works modeling protein surface patches via sets of orthogonal polynomials to identify regions of high shape/electrostatic complementarity. By incorporating another key binding property, such as the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic contributions, we define new binding matrices that serve an effective inputs for training a neural network. Our approach also allows for the quantitative definition of a typical binding site area - approximately 10\AA~in radius - where hydrophobic contribution and shape complementarity, which reflects the Lennard-Jones interaction, are maximized. Using this new architecture, CIRNet (Core Interacting Residues Network), we achieve an accuracy of approximately 0.82 in identifying pairs of core interacting residues on a balanced dataset. In a blind search for core interacting residues, CIRNet distinguishes these from decoys with a ROC AUC of 0.72. This protocol can enahnce docking algorithms by rescaling the proposed poses. When applied to the top ten models from three popular docking server, CIRNet improves docking outcomes, reducing the the average RMSD between the refined poses and the native state by up to 58%.</description>

      <title>Dimeric Drug Polymeric Micelles with Acid-Active Tumor Targeting and FRET-indicated Drug Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT), a cell-penetrating peptide, has been extensively used for facilitating cellular uptake and nuclear targeting of drug delivery systems. However, the positively charged TAT peptide usually strongly interacts with serum components and undergoes substantial phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, causing a short blood circulation in vivo. In this work, an acid-active tumor targeting nanoplatform DA-TAT-PECL was developed to effectively inhibit the nonspecific interactions of TAT in the bloodstream. 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DA) was first used to convert the TAT amines to carboxylic acid, the resulting DA-TAT was further conjugated to get DA-TAT-PECL. After self-assembly into polymeric micelles, they were capable of circulating in the physiological condition for a long time and promoting cell penetration upon accumulation at the tumor site and de-shielding the DA group. Moreover, camptothecin (CPT) was used as the anticancer drug and modified into a dimer (CPT)2-ss-Mal, in which two CPT molecules were connected by a reduction-labile maleimide thioether bond. The FRET signal between CPT and maleimide thioether bond was monitored to visualize the drug release process and effective targeted delivery of antitumor drugs was demonstrated. This pH/reduction dual-responsive micelle system provides a new platform for high fidelity cancer therapy.</description>
