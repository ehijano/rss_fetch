      <title>LLM Assisted Alpha Fairness for 6 GHz WiFi and NR_U Coexistence: An Agentic Orchestrator for Throughput, Energy, and SLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlicensed 6GHz is becoming a primary workhorse for high-capacity access, with Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U competing for the same channels under listen-before-talk (LBT) rules. Operating in this regime requires decisions that jointly trade throughput, energy, and service-level objectives while remaining safe and auditable. We present an agentic controller that separates {policy} from {execution}. At the start of each scheduling epoch the agent summarizes telemetry (per-channel busy and baseline LBT failure; per-user CQI, backlog, latency, battery, priority, and power mode) and invokes a large language model (LLM) to propose a small set of interpretable knobs: a fairness index \alpha, per-channel duty-cycle caps for Wi-Fi/NR-U, and class weights. A deterministic optimizer then enforces feasibility and computes an \alpha-fair allocation that internalizes LBT losses and energy cost; malformed or unsafe policies are clamped and fall back to a rule baseline. In a 6GHz simulator with two 160MHz channels and mixed Wi-Fi/NR-U users, LLM-assisted policies consistently improve energy efficiency while keeping throughput competitive with a strong rule baseline. One LLM lowers total energy by 35.3% at modest throughput loss, and another attains the best overall trade-off, finishing with higher total bits (+3.5%) and higher bits/J (+12.2%) than the baseline. We release code, per-epoch logs, and plotting utilities to reproduce all figures and numbers, illustrating how transparent, policy-level LLM guidance can safely improve wireless coexistence.</description>

      <title>Towards the True Switching-ON of Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transistors are core component across all domains of electrical and electronic engineering (EEE), such as data centers, electrified transportation, robotics, renewables and grid applications, etc. Transistors' switching behavior governs energy loss, carbon emissions, cooling demand, water use, lifetime, material use and cost etc. throughout EEE. Despite near a century since the transistor's invention, the understanding of transistor switching remains fragmented: switching is treated as a black box relying on observed waveforms, cannot be explained using physical laws alone, and is not integrated into circuit theory. This forms one of the most critical barriers to recognizing the true physical boundaries, prohibiting more sustainable solutions. For example, the conventional Eon prediction model, derived from the conventional switching analysis, exhibits significant prediction errors (ranging from 34.41% to 80.05%). Here we present a unified first-principles paradigm to explain the switching phenomena. Using this paradigm, we revealed the physical origins and mechanisms of switching-ON phenomena across scenarios, and derived the proposed Eon prediction model, with error ranging from 0.88% to 11.60%, achieving a 17-fold average improvement. These results demonstrate the unprecedented power of the proposed paradigm: textbook-level foundations are established, transforming the fundamental understanding of transistor switching from empirical to first-principles analysis, and simultaneously stimulating follow-up research and applications for sustainable development across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Introducing Coherent-Control Koopman to Reservoir Scale Porous Media Flow Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust surrogate modeling is essential for the real time control and optimization of large-scale subsurface systems, such as geological CO2 storage and waterflood management. This study investigates the limits of classical Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) in replicating pressure and water saturation dynamics under challenging prediction scenarios. We benchmark CCKM against DMDc and a Hybrid B-only surrogate that reuses DMDcs bottom B (same step feed through), showing that only CCKM remains stable and accurate under regime shifts. Two representative cases are considered: (i) an out of distribution shut in and restart case, and (ii) an in distribution bottom hole pressure (BHP) drawdown. Results show that only CCKM consistently maintains stability and accuracy across both scenarios, achieving sub bar mean absolute error and sub percent Frobenius norm percent change error even under regime shifts, while DMDc exhibit large unphysical errors during control transients. The findings demonstrate that strict control coherence is critical for reliable surrogate modeling, particularly in settings with abrupt changes in control strategy. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to real time reservoir optimization and can be integrated seamlessly into existing optimization and monitoring workflows, enabling fast and trustworthy decision support in the presence of both expected and unexpected actuation regimes.</description>

      <title>Mixed Monotonicity Reachability Analysis of Neural ODE: A Trade-Off Between Tightness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODE) are powerful continuous-time machine learning models for depicting the behavior of complex dynamical systems, but their verification remains challenging due to limited reachability analysis tools adapted to them. We propose a novel interval-based reachability method that leverages continuous-time mixed monotonicity techniques for dynamical systems to compute an over-approximation for the neural ODE reachable sets. By exploiting the geometric structure of full initial sets and their boundaries via the homeomorphism property, our approach ensures efficient bound propagation. By embedding neural ODE dynamics into a mixed monotone system, our interval-based reachability approach, implemented in TIRA with single-step, incremental, and boundary-based approaches, provides sound and computationally efficient over-approximations compared with CORA's zonotopes and NNV2.0 star set representations, while trading tightness for efficiency. This trade-off makes our method particularly suited for high-dimensional, real-time, and safety-critical applications. Applying mixed monotonicity to neural ODE reachability analysis paves the way for lightweight formal analysis by leveraging the symmetric structure of monotone embeddings and the geometric simplicity of interval boxes, opening new avenues for scalable verification aligned with the symmetry and geometry of neural representations. This novel approach is illustrated on two numerical examples of a spiral system and a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.</description>

      <title>DMTrack: Deformable State-Space Modeling for UAV Multi-Object Tracking with Kalman Fusion and Uncertainty-Aware Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents unique challenges due to unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, and limited appearance cues inherent to aerial viewpoints. These issues are further exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency, highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Driven State-Reduction for Reliable UAV Trajectory Optimization in Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a Graph-Condensed Quantum-Inspired Placement (GC-QAP) framework for reliability-driven trajectory optimization in Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted low-altitude wireless networks. The dense waypoint graph is condensed using probabilistic quantum-annealing to preserve interference-aware centroids while reducing the control state space and maintaining link-quality. The resulting problem is formulated as a priority-aware Markov decision process and solved using epsilon-greedy off-policy Q-learning, considering UAV kinematic and flight corridor constraints. Unlike complex continuous-action reinforcement learning approaches, GC-QAP achieves stable convergence and low outage with substantially and lower computational cost compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Epistemology-Inspired Bayesian Games for Distributed IoT Uplink Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive number of simultaneous Internet of Things (IoT) uplinks strain gateways with interference and energy limits, yet devices often lack neighbors' Channel State Information (CSI) and cannot sustain centralized Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or heavy Machine Learning (ML) coordination. Classical Bayesian solvers help with uncertainty but become intractable as users and strategies grow, making lightweight, distributed control essential. In this paper, we introduce the first-ever, novel epistemic Bayesian game for uplink power control under incomplete CSI that operates while suppressing interference among multiple uplink channels from distributed IoT devices firing at the same time. Nodes run inter-/intra-epistemic belief updates over opponents' strategies, replacing exhaustive expected-utility tables with conditional belief hierarchies. Using an exponential-Gamma SINR model and higher-order utility moments (variance, skewness, kurtosis), the scheme remains computationally lean with a single-round upper bound of $O\!\left(N^{2} S^{2N}\right)$. Precise power control and stronger coverage amid realistic interference: with channel magnitude equal to $1$ and a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold of $-18$ dB, coverage reaches approximately $60\%$ at approximately $55\%$ of the maximum transmit power; mid-rate devices with a threshold of $-27$ dB achieve full coverage with less than $0.1\%$ of the maximum transmit power.Under $80\%$ interference, a fourth-moment policy cuts average power from approximately $52\%$ to approximately $20\%$ of the maximum transmit power with comparable outage, outperforming expectation-only baselines. These results highlight a principled, computationally lean path to optimal power allocation and higher network coverage under real-world uncertainty within dense, distributed IoT networks.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient IRS-Assisted UAV Spectrum Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework. Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.</description>

      <title>An Exact Quantile-Energy Equality for Terminal Halfspaces in Linear-Gaussian Control with a Discrete-Time Companion, KL/Schrodinger Links, and High-Precision Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an exact equality between the minimal quadratic control energy and the squared normal-quantile gap for terminal halfspaces in linear-Gaussian systems with additive control and quadratic effort $E(u)=\tfrac12\!\int u^\top M u\,dt$ where $M=B^\top\Sigma^{-1}B$. For terminal halfspace events, the minimal energy equals the squared normal-quantile gap divided by twice a controllability-to-noise ratio $R_T^2(w)=(w^\topW_c^M w)/(w^\top V_T w)$ and is attained by a matched-filter control. We provide an exact zero-order-hold discrete-time companion via block exponentials, relate the result to minimum-energy control, Gaussian isoperimetry, risk-sensitive/KL control, and Schrodinger bridges, and validate to high precision with Monte Carlo. We state assumptions, singular-$M$ handling, and edge cases. The statement is a compact synthesis and design-ready translator, not a universal principle. Novelty: while the ingredients (Gramians, Cauchy-Schwarz, Gaussian isoperimetry) are classical, to our knowledge the explicit quantile-energy equality with a constructive matched-filter achiever for terminal halfspaces, and its discrete-time companion, are not recorded together in the cited literature.</description>

      <title>Urban Air Mobility: A Review of Recent Advances in Communication, Management, and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a transformative approach to addressing urban congestion, improving accessibility, and advancing environmental sustainability. Rapid progress has emerged in three tightly linked domains since 2020: (1) Communication, where dynamic spectrum allocation and low-altitude channel characterization support reliable air-ground data exchange; (2) UAM management, with novel air-traffic control concepts for dense, largely autonomous urban airspace; and (3) Sustainability, driven by energy-efficient propulsion, integrated charging infrastructure, and holistic environmental assessment. This paper reviews and synthesizes the latest research across these areas, compares the state-of-the-art solutions, and outlines the technological and infrastructural milestones that are critical to realizing a scalable, sustainable UAM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Distributed Allocation and Resource Scheduling Algorithms Resilient to Link Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed resource allocation (DRA) is fundamental to modern networked systems, spanning applications from economic dispatch in smart grids to CPU scheduling in data centers. Conventional DRA approaches require reliable communication, yet real-world networks frequently suffer from link failures, packet drops, and communication delays due to environmental conditions, network congestion, and security threats.
  We introduce a novel resilient DRA algorithm that addresses these critical challenges, and our main contributions are as follows: (1) guaranteed constraint feasibility at all times, ensuring resource-demand balance even during algorithm termination or network disruption; (2) robust convergence despite sector-bound nonlinearities at nodes/links, accommodating practical constraints like quantization and saturation; and (3) optimal performance under merely uniformly-connected networks, eliminating the need for continuous connectivity.
  Unlike existing approaches that require persistent network connectivity and provide only asymptotic feasibility, our graph-theoretic solution leverages network percolation theory to maintain performance during intermittent disconnections. This makes it particularly valuable for mobile multi-agent systems where nodes frequently move out of communication range. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm converges to optimal solutions despite heterogeneous time delays and substantial link failures, significantly advancing the reliability of distributed resource allocation in practical network environments.</description>

      <title>Sliding-Mode Control Strategies for PMSM speed control: A Comprehensive Review, Taxonomy and Research Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely employed in high-performance drive systems due to their high efficiency, power density, and precise dynamic behavior. However, nonlinearities, load disturbances, and parameter uncertainties present persistent challenges to control. Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) remains one of the most reliable strategies for high-performance PMSM drives. Yet, the rapid proliferation of adaptive, fractional-order, and intelligent variants has fragmented recent literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review and taxonomy of SMC-based PMSM speed-control methods published between 2020 and 2025. More than 200 studies are systematically analyzed and classified according to control order, surface design, disturbance-observer integration, optimization approach, and intelligent augmentation. Trends in publication activity, dominant hybrid structures, and application domains are quantitatively summarized. The review reveals a clear evolution from conventional discontinuous SMC toward adaptive, higher-order, and data-driven frameworks that mitigate chattering while preserving robustness. Persistent research gaps are identified in hardware validation, energy-efficiency assessment, and real-time tuning strategies. The taxonomy and critical synthesis provided herein establish a coherent reference for researchers and form the conceptual foundation for the companion paper (Part II), which delivers a unified benchmark and comparative simulation study of representative SMC designs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Security for Networked Control Systems: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are integral in critical infrastructures such as power grids, transportation networks, and production systems. Ensuring the resilient operation of these large-scale NCSs against cyber-attacks is crucial for societal well-being. Over the past two decades, extensive research has been focused on developing metrics to quantify the vulnerabilities of NCSs against attacks. Once the vulnerabilities are quantified, mitigation strategies can be employed to enhance system resilience. This article provides a comprehensive overview of methods developed for assessing NCS vulnerabilities and the corresponding mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of probabilistic risk metrics to model vulnerabilities under adversaries with imperfect process knowledge. The article concludes by outlining promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$-Based Adaptive Identification under Quantized Observations with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized observations are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications across engineering and the social sciences, and algorithms based on the $\ell_1$-norm are well recognized for their robustness to outliers compared with their $\ell_2$-based counterparts. Nevertheless, adaptive identification methods that integrate quantized observations with $\ell_1$-optimization remain largely underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we develop a novel $\ell_1$-based adaptive identification algorithm specifically designed for quantized observations. Without relying on the traditional persistent excitation condition, we establish global convergence of the parameter estimates to their true values and show that the average regret asymptotically vanishes as the data size increases. Finally, we apply our new identification algorithm to a judicial sentencing problem using real-world data, which demonstrates its superior performance and practical significance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Performance Evaluation of a Solar-Powered Hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid in a Radio-Controlled Electric Vehicle</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation and performance evaluation of a hybrid electric radio-controlled car powered by a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery combined with a renewable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system. The study evaluates the performance of the system under various load-carrying scenarios and varying environmental conditions, simulating real-world operating conditions including throttle operation. In order to build a predictive model, gather operational insights, and detect anomalies, data-driven analyses using signal processing and modern machine learning techniques were employed. Specifically, machine learning techniques were used to distinguish throttle levels with high precision based on the operational data. Anomaly and change point detection methods enhanced voltage stability, resulting in fewer critical faults in the hybrid system compared to battery-only operation. Temporal Convolutional Networks were effectively employed to predict voltage behavior, demonstrating potential for use in planning the locations of fueling or charging stations. Moreover, integration with a solar-powered electrolyzer confirmed the system's potential for off-grid, renewable hydrogen use. The results indicate that integrating a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell with Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries significantly improves electrical performance and reliability for small electric vehicles, and these findings can be a potential baseline for scaling up to larger vehicles.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Orchestration of Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks via Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) are envisioned as key enablers of 6G, providing global connectivity for applications such as autonomous transportation, Industrial IoT, and disaster response. Their large-scale deployment, however, risks unsustainable energy use and carbon emissions. This work advances prior energy-aware studies by proposing a carbon-aware orchestration framework for ISATNs that leverages Digital Twin (DT) technology. The framework adopts grams of CO$_2$-equivalent per bit (gCO$_2$/bit) as a primary sustainability metric and implements a multi timescale Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) loop that combines day-ahead forecasting with real-time adaptive optimization. ISATN-specific control knobs, including carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement, are exploited to reduce emissions. Simulation results with real carbon intensity data show up to 29\% lower gCO$_2$/bit than QoS-only orchestration, while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.</description>

      <title>Robust interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectra using numerical complex analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-invasive technique widely used for understanding charge transfer and charge transport processes in electrochemical systems and devices. Standard approaches for the interpretation of EIS data involve starting with a hypothetical circuit model for the physical processes in the device based on experience/intuition, and then fitting the EIS data to this circuit model. This work explores a mathematical approach for extracting key characteristic features from EIS data by relying on fundamental principles of complex analysis. These characteristic features can ascertain the presence of inductors and constant phase elements (non-ideal capacitors) in circuit models and enable us to answer questions about the identifiability and uniqueness of equivalent circuit models. In certain scenarios such as models with only resistors and capacitors, we are able to enumerate all possible families of circuit models. Finally, we apply the mathematical framework presented here to real-world electrochemical systems and highlight results using impedance measurements from a lithium-ion battery coin cell.</description>

      <title>Two Phases Leakage Detection Strategy Supported by DMAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work proposes a novel two phases model-based strategy for leakage detection. The two phases are: the identification of the district metering area (DMA) and the pipe pre-localization into the identified DMA. The strategy is based on detecting and pre-localizing the punctual leakage as anomaly with respect to the normal working conditions. A further novelty is the fact that the pre-localization phase returns the sequence of pipes to inspect, which makes the strategy attractive for water utilities, whose aim is to identify the anomaly at DMA level and, successively, to localize it with the minimum inspection cost. Furthermore, a random database is useful to test the performance of the strategy with respect to the configuration of DMAs and the pressure metering system. Consequently, a novel strategy to design the location of pressure meters is also proposed. It is demonstrated that the entire strategy limits false positives during the DMA identification phase by using the recently proposed index named Asset Management Support Indicator (AMSI). AMSI is invariant with respect to the deterioration, i.e., it is sensitive to its increase causing punctual leakage. The strategy is studied and discussed using two real Apulian WDNs managed by Acquedotto Pugliese.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces Prompt-to-Primal (P2P) Teaching, an AI-integrated instructional approach that links prompt-driven exploration with first-principles reasoning, guided and moderated by the instructor within the classroom setting. In P2P teaching, student-generated AI prompts serve as entry points for inquiry and initial discussions in class, while the instructor guides learners to validate, challenge, and reconstruct AI responses through fundamental physical and mathematical laws. The approach encourages self-reflective development, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and conceptual foundational knowledge of the core engineering principles. A large language model (LLM) can be a highly effective tool for those who already possess foundational knowledge of a subject; however, it may also mislead students who lack sufficient background in the subject matter. Results from two student cohorts across different semesters suggest the pedagogical effectiveness of the P2P teaching framework in enhancing both AI literacy and engineering reasoning.</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.</description>

      <title>ANGEL: A Novel Gripper for Versatile and Light-touch Fruit Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength. Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's suitability for fruit harvesting.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Cancellation in Multi-Electrolyzer P2H Plants via Phasor-Modulated Production Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thyristor rectifiers (TRs) are cost-effective power supplies for hydrogen electrolyzers (ELZs) but introduce harmonic distortion that may violate grid codes. This letter proposes a self-governing harmonic mitigation strategy through coordinated operation of multiple ELZs in large power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants. First, the harmonic model of TR-powered ELZs is derived, revealing a natural harmonic cancellation mechanism among them. Based on this, a system-level operation scheme based on phasor modulation is developed and integrated into plant scheduling. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces harmonic currents by 21.2%-39.7% and ensures grid-code compliance, with only a 0.25% loss in hydrogen output, while increasing total revenue by over 21\% compared to production-oriented strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although research on the control of networked systems has grown considerably, graph-theoretic and algorithmic studies on matrix-weighted graphs remain limited. To bridge this gap in the literature, this work introduces two algorithms-the brute-force search and the Warshall algorithm-for determining connectedness and clustering in undirected matrix-weighted graphs. The proposed algorithms, which are derived from a sufficient condition for connectedness, emphasize a key distinction between matrix-weighted and scalar-weighted graphs. While the existence of a path between two vertices guarantees connectedness in scalar-weighted graphs, connectedness in matrix-weighted graphs is a collective contribution of all paths joining the two vertices. Proofs of correctness and numerical examples are provided to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Explicit Reformulation of Discrete Distributionally Robust Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is an effective framework for controlling real-world systems with various uncertainties, typically modeled using distributional uncertainty balls. However, DRO problems often involve infinitely many inequality constraints, rendering exact solutions computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a discrete DRO (DDRO) method that significantly simplifies the problem by reducing it to a single trivial constraint. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes two types of distributional uncertainty balls to reformulate the DDRO problem into a single-layer smooth convex program, significantly improving tractability. Furthermore, we provide practical guidance for selecting the appropriate ball sizes. The original DDRO problem is further reformulated into two optimization problems: one minimizing the mean and standard deviation, and the other minimizing the conditional value at risk (CVaR). These formulations account for the choice of ball sizes, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of the method. The proposed method was applied to a distributionally robust patrol-agent design problem, identifying a Pareto front in which the mean and standard deviation of the mean hitting time varied by up to 3% and 14%, respectively, while achieving a CVaR reduction of up to 13%.</description>

      <title>Coverage-Recon: Coordinated Multi-Drone Image Sampling with Online Map Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile, recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D reconstructions than conventional methods.

      <title>MMRHP: A Miniature Mixed-Reality HIL Platform for Auditable Closed-Loop Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>MPC-based motion planning for non-holonomic systems in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for non- holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness, in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Designing trajectories in the Earth-Moon system: a Levenberg-Marquardt approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory design in cislunar space under a High-Fidelity Ephemeris Model (HFEM) is pursued through a nonlinear optimization perspective anchored on the transition of solutions from lower fidelity models, namely the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</description>

      <title>PIRA: Pan-CDN Intra-video Resource Adaptation for Short Video Streaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large scale short video platforms, CDN resource selection plays a critical role in maintaining Quality of Experience (QoE) while controlling escalating traffic costs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct in the wild network measurements during video playback in a production short video system. The results reveal that CDNs delivering higher average QoE often come at greater financial cost, yet their connection quality fluctuates even within a single video underscoring a fundamental and dynamic trade off between QoE and cost. However, the problem of sustaining high QoE under cost constraints remains insufficiently investigated in the context of CDN selection for short video streaming. To address this, we propose PIRA, a dynamic resource selection algorithm that optimizes QoE and cost in real time during video playback. PIRA formally integrating QoE and cost by a mathematical model, and introduce a intra video control theoretic CDN resource selection approach which can balance QoE and cost under network dynamics. To reduce the computation overheads, PIRA employs state space pruning and adaptive parameter adjustment to efficiently solve the high dimensional optimization problem. In large scale production experiments involving 450,000 users over two weeks, PIRA outperforms the production baseline, achieving a 2.1% reduction in start up delay, 15.2% shorter rebuffering time, and 10% lower average unit traffic cost, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing user experience and financial cost at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical note, we prove that the ODEFTC algorithm constitutes the first optimal distributed state estimator for continuous-time linear time-varying systems subject to stochastic disturbances. Particularly, we formally show that it is able to asymptotically recover the performance, in terms of error covariance of the estimates at each node, of the centralized Kalman-Bucy filter, which is known to be the optimal filter for the considered class of systems. Moreover, we provide a simple sufficient value for the consensus gain to guarantee the stability of the distributed estimator.</description>

      <title>MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial DeepReach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Aware Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Vehicle Control: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies finite-time safety and reach-avoid verification for stochastic discrete-time dynamical systems. The aim is to ascertain lower and upper bounds of the probability that, within a predefined finite-time horizon, a system starting from an initial state in a safe set will either exit the safe set (safety verification) or reach a target set while remaining within the safe set until the first encounter with the target (reach-avoid verification). We introduce novel barrier-like sufficient conditions for characterizing these bounds, which either complement existing ones or fill gaps. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of these conditions on two examples.</description>

      <title>Unifying Direct and Indirect Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops learning-enabled safe controllers for linear systems subject to system uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Given the disturbance zonotope, the databased closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized using a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a constrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing conformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance realizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used separately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that conform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ of the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces conservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop learning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership identification method that models open-loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior knowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) of this CMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data becomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior knowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop learning process. The resulting refined parameterized set of CLD is subsequently leveraged to directly and adaptively learn a controller that robustly enforces safety. Toward this goal, we formulate a linear programming problem that guarantees {\lambda}contractiveness of a polyhedral safe set. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Accurate Small-Signal Modeling of Digitally Controlled Buck Converters with ADC-PWM Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital control has become increasingly widespread in modern power electronic converters. When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current, synchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their steady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such synchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact small-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced continuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode control, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a sampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects introduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog and digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling frequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are considered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using the modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and stability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be directly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for computationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the proposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Communication and Human Uncertainties on Runway Capacity in Terminal Airspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential impact of communication and human performance uncertainties on runway operations. Specifically, we consider these impacts within the context of an arrival scenario with two converging flows: a straight-in approach stream and a downwind stream merging into it. Both arrival stream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the separation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level uncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and human-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte Carlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by modified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints, simulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard bank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap availability in real time. Then, we investigate an automated final approach vectoring model (i.e., Auto-ATC), in which inverse optimal control is used to learn decision advisories from human expert records. By augmenting trajectories and incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario, we create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation. For both studies, runway capacity is measured by runway throughput, the fraction of downwind arrivals that merge immediately without holding, and the average delay (i.e., holding time/distance) experienced on the downwind leg. This research provides a method for runway capacity estimation in merging scenarios, and demonstrates that aeronautical communication link uncertainties significantly affect runway capacity in current voice-based operations, whereas the impact can be mitigated in autonomous operational settings.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication (MIC) has emerged as a promising candidate for underground communication networks due to its excellent penetration capabilities. Integration with Space-Air-Ground-Underground (SAGUI) networks in next-generation mobile communication systems requires a well-defined network architecture. A recent discovery in MIC research, MI fast fading, remains in its early stages and presents unique challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on through-the-earth (TTE) MIC, covering MI applications, channel modeling, point-to-point MIC design, relay techniques, network frameworks, and emerging technologies. We compare various MIC applications to highlight TTE-specific challenges and review the principles of channel modeling, addressing both MI slow fading and MI fast fading, along with its potential impact on existing MIC theories. We conduct a fine-grained decomposition of MI channel power gain into four distinct physical parameters, and propose a novel geometric model to analyze MI fast fading. We also summarize MI relay techniques, examine crosstalk effects in relay and high-density networks, and explore key research tasks within the OSI framework for a holistic MI network protocol in SAGUI. To bridge the gaps identified, we propose a MIC framework that supports TCP/IP and Linux, enabling full implementation of existing and emerging MIC solutions. This framework empowers researchers to leverage Linux resources and deep learning platforms for accelerated development of MIC in SAGUI networks. Remaining research challenges, open issues, and promising novel techniques are further identified to advance MIC research.</description>

      <title>One-Pass Learning via Bridging Orthogonal Gradient Descent and Recursive Least-Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes over the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous datapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized models and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to perfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on previous datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to past gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual learning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation similar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering but with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e., linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reduce memory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using the principal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-case forgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, we prove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.</description>

Abstract: Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, especially as diverse low-carbon technologies (e.g., photovoltaic and electric vehicles) are increasingly adopted. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it demonstrates superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical models, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce turnpike arguments in the context of optimal state estimation. In particular, we show that the optimal solution of the state estimation problem involving all available past data serves as turnpike for the solutions of truncated problems involving only a subset of the data. We mathematically formalize this phenomenon and derive a sufficient condition that relies on a decaying sensitivity property of the underlying nonlinear program. As second contribution, we show how a specific turnpike property can be used to establish performance guarantees when approximating the optimal solution of the full problem by a sequence of truncated problems, and we show that the resulting performance (both averaged and non-averaged) is approximately optimal with error terms that can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of the horizon length. In addition, we discuss interesting implications of these results for the practically relevant case of moving horizon estimation and illustrate our results with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the AFL algorithm by training decentralized linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers and compare its results with synchronous FL algorithm to effectively handling non-IID data distributed among clients. The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements indistributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</description>

      <title>Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query</title>

Abstract: For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>PowerChain: A Verifiable Agentic AI System for Automating Distribution Grid Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</description>

      <title>Neural 3D Object Reconstruction with Small-Scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12458</link>

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.</description>

      <title>Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.</description>
