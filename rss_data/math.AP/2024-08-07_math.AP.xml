      <title>Asymptotics for the cubic 1D NLS with a slowly decaying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an external potential $V$ that does not admit bound states. Assuming that $\langle x\rangle^{2+}V(x) \in L^1$ and that $u$ is orthogonal to any zero-energy resonances, we show that solutions exhibit modified scattering behavior. Our decay assumptions are weaker than those appearing in previous work and are likely nearly optimal for exceptional potentials, since the M\o{}ller wave operators are not known to be bounded on $L^p$ spaces unless $\langle x\rangle^2V \in L^1$.
  Our method combines two techniques: First, we prove a new class of linear estimates, which allow us to relate weights associated with the equation with potential to weights associated with the flat equation, up to localized error terms. By using the improved local decay coming from the zero-energy assumption, we can treat these errors perturbatively, allowing us to treat the weighted estimates using the same vector field arguments as in the flat case. Second, we derive the asymptotic profile using the wave packet testing method introduced by Ifrim and Tataru. Again, by taking advantage of improved local decay near the origin, we are able to treat the potential as a lower-order perturbation, allowing us to use tools developed to study the flat problem.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional solitary water waves with constant vorticity, Part II: the deep capillary case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional capillary water waves with nonzero constant vorticity in infinite depth. We first derive the Babenko equation that describes the profile of the solitary wave. When the velocity $c$ is close to a critical velocity and a sign condition involving the physical parameters is met, the Babenko equation can be reduced to the stationary focusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation plus perturbative error. We show the existence of a critical value of a dimensionless physical parameter below which at least two families of velocities satisfy the focusing condition and above which only one does. This gives the existence of small-amplitude solitary wave solutions for the water wave system with constant vorticity.</description>

      <title>Mathematical study of a new Navier-Stokes-alpha model with nonlinear filter equation -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the mathematical study of a new Navier-Stokes-alpha model with a nonlinear filter equation. For a given indicator function, this filter equation was first considered by W. Layton, G. Rebholz, and C. Trenchea to select eddies for damping based on the understanding of how nonlinearity acts in real flow problems. Numerically, this nonlinear filter equation was applied to the nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes equations to provide a precise analysis of numerical diffusion and error estimates. Mathematically, the resulting alpha-model is described by a doubly nonlinear parabolic-elliptic coupled system. We therefore undertake the first theoretical study of this system by considering periodic boundary conditions in the spatial variable. Specifically, we address the existence and uniqueness of weak Leray-type solutions, their rigorous convergence to weak Leray solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, and their long-time dynamics through the concept of the global attractor and some upper bounds for its fractal dimension. Handling the nonlinear filter equation together with the well-known nonlinear transport term makes certain estimates delicate, particularly when deriving upper bounds on the fractal dimension. For the latter, we adapt techniques developed for hyperbolic-type equations.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type result for the $p$-Laplacian via integral identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative version of a Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type symmetry result involving the $p$-Laplacian.
  Quantitative stability is achieved here via integral identities based on the proof of rigidity established by J. Serra in 2013, which extended to general dimension and the $p$-Laplacian operator an argument proposed by P. L. Lions in dimension $2$ for the classical Laplacian.
  Stability results for the classical Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg symmetry theorem (involving the classical Laplacian) via the method of moving planes were established by Rosset in 1994 and by Ciraolo, Cozzi, Perugini, Pollastro in 2024.
  To the authors' knowledge, the present paper provides the first quantitative Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type result involving the $p$-Laplacian for $p \neq 2$. Even for the classical Laplacian (i.e., for $p=2$), this is the first time that integral identities are used to achieve stability for a Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg-type result.
  In passing, we obtain a quantitative estimate for the measure of the singular set and an explicit uniform gradient bound.</description>

      <title>Failure of $L^r$-Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for the p-Laplace equation for small $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p \neq 2$. For any small enough $r&gt; \max \{p-1,1\}$ and for any $\Lambda &gt; 1$ there exists a Lipschitz function $u$ and a bounded vectorfield $f$ such that \[ \begin{cases}
  {\rm div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u) = {\rm div} (f) \quad&amp; \text{in $\mathbb{B}^2$}\\ u=0 &amp;\text{on $\partial \mathbb{B}^2$} \end{cases}
  \] but \[
  \int_{\mathbb{B}^2} |\nabla u|^r \not \leq \Lambda \int_{\mathbb{B}^2} |f|^{\frac{r}{p-1}}. \] This disproves a conjecture by Iwaniec from 1983. The proof adapts recent convex-integration ideas by Colombo-Tione.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with Calder\'on's problem in a layered anisotropic medium $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, with complex anisotropic admittivity $\sigma=\gamma A$, where $A$ is a known Lipschitz matrix-valued function and $\gamma$ is an unknown complex-valued function, assumed to be affine on each layer of $\Omega$. We provide H\"{o}lder and Lipschitz stability estimates of $\sigma$ in terms of an ad hoc misfit functional as well as the more classical Dirichlet to Neumann map localised on some open portion $\Sigma$ of $\partial\Omega$, respectively.</description>

      <title>From the Boltzmann equation for gas mixture to the two-fluid incompressible hydrodynamic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit transition from the Boltzmann equation for gas mixtures to the two-fluid macroscopic system. Employing a meticulous dimensionless analysis, we derive several novel hydrodynamic models via the moments' method. For a certain class of scaled Boltzmann equations governing gas mixtures of two species, we rigorously establish the two-fluid incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system as the hydrodynamic limit. This validation is achieved through the Hilbert expansion around the global Maxwellian and refined energy estimates based on the Macro-Micro decomposition.</description>

      <title>Long time validity of the linearized Boltzmann uncut-off and the linearized Landau equations from the Newton Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of the linearized Boltzmann- and Landau equations from interacting particle systems with long-range interaction. The result shows that the fluctuations of Hamiltonian $N$- particle systems governed by truncated power law potentials of the form $\mathcal{U}(r)\sim |r/\varepsilon|^{-s}$ (near $r \approx 0$) converge to solutions of kinetic equations in appropriate scaling limits $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $N\rightarrow \infty$. We prove that for $s\in [0,1)$, the limiting system approaches the uncutoff linearized Boltzmann equation or the linearized Landau equation, depending on the scaling limit. The Coulomb singularity $s=1$ appears as a threshold value. Kinetic scaling limits with $s\in (0,1]$ universally converge to the linearized Landau equation, and we prove the onset of the Coulomb logarithm for $s=1$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the derivation of kinetic equations from interacting particle systems with long-range power-law interaction.</description>

      <title>The Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem in a class of weighted function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem with an initial datum in a weighted Lebesgue space. The weight is a radial function increasing at infinity. Our study partially follows the ideas of the paper by G.P. Galdi and P. Maremonti "On the stability of steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space", JMFM, 25 (2023). The authors of the quoted paper consider a spatial study of stability of steady fluid motions. The result hold in 3D and for small data. Here, relatively to the perturbations of the rest state, we generalize the result. We study the nD Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem, n greater than 2. We prove the existence (local) of a unique regular solution. Moreover, the solution enjoys a spatial asymptotic decay whose order of decay is connected to the weight.</description>

      <title>An elliptic approximation for phase separation in a fractured material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free-boundary and free-discontinuity energy connecting phase separation and fracture in an elastic material. The energy excludes the contribution of phase boundaries in the cracked region, providing a heuristic approximation of the interfacial energy in the current material configuration. Our primary result shows that the sharp energy may be recovered via Gamma-convergence from a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy coupled with an Ambrosio-Tortorelli-type approximation of the (linear) elastic and fracture energy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric deformations of a perturbed spherical bubble in an incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a gas bubble in a fluid with surface tension, initially near a spherical equilibrium. While there are many studies and applications of radial bubble dynamics, the theory of general deformations from a spherical equilibrium is less developed. We aim to understand how asymmetrically perturbed equilibrium bubbles evolve toward spherical equilibrium due to thermal or viscous dissipation in an incompressible liquid. We focus on the isobaric approximation [Prosperetti, JFM, 1991], under which the gas pressure within the bubble is spatially uniform and obeys the ideal gas law. The liquid outside the bubble is incompressible, irrotational, and has surface tension. We prove that any equilibrium gas bubble must be spherical by showing that the bubble boundary is a closed surface of constant mean curvature. We then study the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled PDEs, constitutive laws and interface conditions of the isobaric approximation for general (asymmetric) small initial perturbations of the spherical bubble in the linearized approximation. Our first result, considering thermal damping without viscosity, proves that the linearized IVP is globally well-posed. The monopole (radial) component of the perturbation decays exponentially over time, while the multipole (non-radial) components undergo undamped oscillations. This indicates a limitation of the isobaric model for non-spherical dynamics. Our second result, incorporating viscous dissipation, shows that the IVP is linear and nonlinearly ill-posed due to an incompatibility of normal stress boundary conditions, for non-spherical solutions, and the irrotationality assumption. Our study concludes that to accurately capture the dynamics of general deformations of a gas bubble, the model must account for either vorticity generated at the bubble-fluid boundary, spatial non-uniformities in the gas pressure, or both.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on the study of the existence, multiplicity and concentration behavior of ground states as well as the qualitative aspects of positive solutions for a $(p, N)$-Laplace Schr\"{o}dinger equation with logarithmic nonlinearity and critical exponential nonlinearity in the sense of Trudinger-Moser in the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^N$. Through the use of smooth variational methods, penalization techniques, and the application of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory, we establish a connection between the number of positive solutions and the topological properties of the set in which the potential function achieves its minimum values.</description>

      <title>The Biot stress -- right stretch relation for the compressible Neo-Hooke-Ciarlet-Geymonat model and Rivlin's cube problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to recall the importance of the study of invertibility and monotonicity of stress-strain relations for investigating the non-uniqueness and bifurcation of homogeneous solutions of the equilibrium problem of a hyperelastic cube subjected to equiaxial tensile forces. In other words, we reconsider a remarkable possibility in this nonlinear scenario: Does symmetric loading lead only to symmetric deformations or also to asymmetric deformations? If so, what can we say about monotonicity for these homogeneous solutions, a property which is less restrictive than the energetic stability criteria of homogeneous solutions for Rivlin's cube problem. For the Neo-Hooke type materials we establish what properties the volumetric function $h$ depending on ${\rm det}\, F$ must have to ensure the existence of a unique radial solution (i.e. the cube must continue to remain a cube) for any magnitude of radial stress acting on the cube. The function $h$ proposed by Ciarlet and Geymonat satisfies these conditions. However, discontinuous equilibrium trajectories may occur, characterized by abruptly appearing non-symmetric deformations with increasing load, and a cube can instantaneously become a parallelepiped. Up to the load value for which the bifurcation in the radial solution is realized local monotonicity holds true. However, after exceeding this value, monotonicity no longer occurs on homogeneous deformations which, in turn, preserve the cube shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a gradient flow of the elastic energy which preserves the enclosed area of evolving planar curves. Contrary to an earlier approach, we give priority to locality, resulting in a sixth order evolution equation. For this new area preserving flow, we prove a global existence result. Additionally, by penalizing the length, we show convergence to an area constrained critical point of the elastic energy.</description>

      <title>Resolvent Estimates in $L^\infty$ for the Stokes Operator in Nonsmooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish resolvent estimates in spaces of bounded solenoidal functions for the Stokes operator in a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $R^d$ under the assumptions that $\Omega$ is $C^1$ for $d\ge 3$ and Lipschitz for $d=2$. As a corollary, it follows that the Stokes operator generates a uniformly bounded analytic semigroup in the spaces of bounded solenoidal functions in $\Omega$. The smoothness conditions on $\Omega$ are sharp. The case of exterior domains with nonsmooth boundaries is also studied.The key step in the proof involves new estimates which connect the pressure to the velocity in the $L^q$ average, but only on scales above certain level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the qualitative aspects of dark solitons of one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with general nonlocal interactions, which correspond to traveling waves with subsonic speeds. Under general conditions on the potential interaction term, we provide uniform bounds, demonstrate the existence of symmetric solitons, and identify conditions under which monotonicity is lost. Additionally, we present new properties of black solitons. Moreover, we establish the nonlocal-to-local convergence, i.e. the convergence of the soliton of the nonlocal model toward the explicit dark solitons of the local Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for a stochastic semilinear CahnHilliard type equation, whose semilinear term contains first and second order derivatives of solutions. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear backward stochastic fourth order parabolic equations with $L^2$-valued source terms is derived, which is based on a new fundamental identity for a stochastic fourth order parabolic operator. Based on it, we establish a new global Carleman estimate for linear backward stochastic fourth order parabolic equations with $H^{-2}$-valued source terms, which, together with a fixed point argument, derive the desired null controllability for the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard type equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous work (Advances in Mathematics 450 (2024), Paper No. 109768). In this paper, we characterize complete metrics with finite total Q-curvature as normal metrics for all dimensional cases. Secondly, we introduce another volume entropy to provide geometric information regarding complete non-normal metrics with finite total Q-curvature. In particular, we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below, the volume growth of such complete metrics is controlled.</description>

      <title>A first-order hyperbolic reformulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new first-order hyperbolic reformulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The model is obtained from the combination of augmented Lagrangian techniques proposed earlier by the authors of this paper, with a classical Cattaneo-type relaxation that allows to reformulate diffusion equations as augmented first order hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation source terms. The proposed system is proven to be hyperbolic and to admit a Lyapunov functional, in accordance with the original equations. A new numerical scheme is proposed to solve the original Cahn-Hilliard equations based on conservative semi-implicit finite differences, while the hyperbolic system was numerically solved by means of a classical second order MUSCL-Hancock-type finite volume scheme. The proposed approach is validated through a set of classical benchmarks such as spinodal decomposition, Ostwald ripening and exact stationary solutions.</description>

Abstract: We prove a lower bound for the entropy dissipation of the Landau equation with Coulomb potentials by a weighted Lebesgue norm $L^3_{-5/3}$. In particular, we enhance the weight exponent from $-5$, which was established by Desvillettes, to $-5/3$. Moreover, we prove that the weighted Lebesgue norm $L^3_{-5/3}$ is optimal for both exponents.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider fractional Sobolev spaces equipped with weights being powers of the distance to the boundary of the domain. We prove the versions of Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu and Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova asymptotic formulae for weighted fractional Gagliardo seminorms. For $p&gt;1$ we also provide a nonlocal characterization of classical weighted Sobolev spaces with power weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with an eigenvalue problem in an interface elliptic equation. We characterize the set of principal eigenvalues as a level set of a concave and regular function. As application, we study a problem arising in population dynamics. In these problems each species lives in a subdomain, and they interact in a common border, which acts as a geographical barrier.</description>

      <title>Constraint maps with free boundaries: the Bernoulli case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we delve into the study of maps $u\in W^{1,2}(\Omega;\overline M)$ that minimize the Alt-Caffarelli energy functional $$ \int_\Omega (|Du|^2 + q^2 \chi_{u^{-1}(M)})\,dx, $$ under the condition that the image $u(\Omega)$ is confined within $\overline M$. Here, $\Omega$ denotes a bounded domain in the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^n$ (with $n\geq 1$), and $M$ represents a smooth domain in the target space $\mathbb{R}^m$ (where $m\geq 2$).
  Since our minimizing constraint maps coincide with harmonic maps in the interior of the coincidence set, ${\rm int}(u^{-1}(\partial M))$, such maps are prone to developing discontinuities due to their inherent nature. This research marks the commencement of an in-depth analysis of potential singularities that might arise within and around the free boundary.
  Our first significant contribution is the validity of a $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem. This theorem is founded on a novel method of Lipschitz approximation near points exhibiting low energy. Utilizing this approximation and extending the analysis through a bootstrapping approach, we show Lipschitz continuity of our maps whenever the energy is small energy.
  Our subsequent key finding reveals that, whenever the complement of $M$ is uniformly convex and of class $C^3$, the maps minimizing the Alt-Caffarelli energy with a positive parameter $q$ exhibit Lipschitz continuity within a universally defined neighborhood of the non-coincidence set $u^{-1}(M)$. In particular, this Lipschitz continuity extends to the free boundary.
  A noteworthy consequence of our findings is the smoothness of flat free boundaries and of the resulting image maps.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the stabilization of large-scale growth in the 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, some elementary observations are made regarding the behavior of solutions to the two-dimensional curl-free Burgers equation which suggest the distinguished role played by the scalar divergence field in determining the dynamics of the solution. These observations inspire a new divergence-based regularity condition for the two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) that provides conceptual clarity to the nature of the potential blow-up mechanism for this system. The relation of this regularity criterion to the Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin-type criterion for the KSE is also established, thus providing the basis for the development of an alternative framework of regularity criterion for this equation based solely on the low-mode behavior of its solutions. The article concludes by applying these ideas to identify a conceptually simple modification of KSE that yields globally regular solutions, as well as providing a straightforward verification of this regularity criterion to establish global regularity of solutions to the 2D Burgers-Sivashinsky equation. The proofs are direct, elementary, and concise.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear nonlocal eigenvalue problem involving the sum of fractional $(p,q)$-Laplace operators $(-\Delta)_p^{s_1}+(-\Delta)_q^{s_2}$ with $s_1,s_2\in (0,1)$; $p,q\in(1,\infty)$ and subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in an open bounded set of $\mathbb{R}^N$. We prove bifurcation results from trivial solutions and from infinity for the considered nonlinear nonlocal eigenvalue problem. We also show the existence of multiple solutions of the nonlinear nonlocal problem using variational methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the (1+3) dimensional massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the context of global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions under the Lorenz gauge condition, as well as the modified and linear scattering phenomena for the Dirac spinor and the electromagnetic potential, respectively. We employ a vector fields energy method combined with a detailed analysis of the space-time resonance argument. This approach allows us to establish decay estimates and energy bounds crucial for proving the main theorems. Especially, we provide the explicit phase correction arising from the strong nonlinear resonances.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics for the generalized chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system with generalized fluid dissipation in $\mathbb{R}^3$:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{cases} \partial_t n+u\cdot \nabla n=\Delta n- \nabla \cdot (\chi(c)n \nabla c),\\ \partial_t c+u \cdot \nabla c=\Delta c-nf(c),\\ \partial_t u +u \cdot \nabla u+\nabla P=-(-\Delta)^\alpha u-n\nabla \phi,\\ \nabla \cdot u=0,
  \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} which describes the motion of swimming bacteria or bacillus subtilis suspended to water flows. First, we prove some blow-up criteria of strong solutions to the Cauchy problem, including the Prodi-Serrin type criterion ($\alpha&gt;\frac{3}{4}$) and the Beir${\rm\tilde{a}}$o da Veiga type criterion $(\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2})$. Then, we verify the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial fluid velocity and bacteria density for $\alpha\geq \frac{5}{4}$. Furthermore, in the scenario of $\frac{3}{4}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{5}{4}$, we establish uniform regularity estimates and optimal time-decay rates of global solutions if the $L^2$-norm of initial data is small. To our knowledge, this is the first result concerning the global existence and large-time behavior of strong solutions for the chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes equations with possibly large oscillations.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Ne\v{c}as-Lions inequality with symmetric gradients on two and three dimensional domains of diameter $R$ that are star-shaped with respect to a ball of radius $\rho$; the constants in the inequality are explicit with respect to $R$ and $\rho$. Crucial tools in deriving this inequality are a first order Babu\v{s}ka-Aziz inequality based on Bogovski\u{i}'s construction of a right-inverse of the divergence and Fourier transform techniques proposed by Dur\'an. As a byproduct, we derive arbitrary order estimates in arbitrary dimension for that operator.</description>

      <title>Flows of geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an abstract theory of flows of geometric $H$-structures, i.e., flows of tensor fields defining $H$-reductions of the frame bundle, for a closed and connected subgroup $H\subset SO(n)$, on any connected and oriented $n$-manifold with sufficient topology to admit such structures. The first part of the article sets up a unifying theoretical framework for deformations of $H$-structures, by way of the natural infinitesimal action of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ on tensors combined with various bundle decompositions induced by $H$-structures. We compute evolution equations for the intrinsic torsion under general flows of $H$-structures and, as applications, we obtain general Bianchi-type identities for $H$-structures, and, for closed manifolds, a general first variation formula for the $L^2$-Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal{E}$ on the space of $H$-structures. We then specialise the theory to the negative gradient flow of $\mathcal{E}$ over isometric $H$-structures, i.e., their harmonic flow. The core result is an almost monotonocity formula along the flow for a scale-invariant localised energy, similar to the classical formulae by Chen-Struwe for the harmonic map heat flow. This yields an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem and an energy gap result for harmonic structures, as well as long-time existence for the flow under small initial energy, relative to the $L^\infty$-norm of initial torsion, in the spirit of Chen-Ding. Moreover, below a certain energy level, the absence of a torsion-free isometric $H$-structure in the initial homotopy class imposes the formation of finite-time singularities. These seemingly contrasting statements are illustrated by examples on flat $n$-tori, so long as $[\mathbb{S}^n,SO(n)/H]$ contains more than one element and the universal cover of $SO(n)/H$ is a sphere; e.g. when $n=7$ and $H=\rm G_2$, or $n=8$ and $H=\rm Spin(7)$.</description>
