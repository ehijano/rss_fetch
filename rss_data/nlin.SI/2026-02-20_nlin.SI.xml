      <title>Integrable cellular automata on finite fields of order $2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores cellular automata (CA) constructed from Yang-Baxter maps over finite fields $F_{2^n}$. We define $R$-matrices using a map $f$ on $F_{2^n}$ and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $f$ to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that these conditions become remarkably streamlined in characteristic two. An exhaustive search for bijective solutions in fields of order 4, 8, and 16 yields 16, 736, and 269,056 maps, respectively.
  Analysis of the resulting CA under helical boundary conditions reveals a consistent alignment between the temporal period and the field order. We propose the conjecture that this periodic identity holds generally for $F_{2^n}$, supported by analytical proofs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. Our results further indicate that bijectivity is a fundamental requirement for this periodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. II: The General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) $F = 0$ admitting a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry $X$ with the characteristic $\varphi$, invariant solutions satisfy the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. We propose a framework that allows, for every $X$-invariant conservation law, presymplectic structure, variational principle, or another geometric structure of the given PDE system $F = 0$, to systematically calculate its corresponding reduced form that describes the corresponding structure for the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. In particular, we show in what way Noether's theorem holding for the given PDE system is inherited by the reduced PDE system. We consider several detailed examples, including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance. The proposed framework is directly applicable to a wide range of PDE models, including complex PDE systems of contemporary interest arising across disciplines, where symmetry reduction is essential for analysis and simulation, as well as to integrable, Lagrangian, and gauge systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple commutation relations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$, nested Bethe vector and the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a certain type of multiple commutation relations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We show that all the coefficients in the multiple commutation relations between the $L$-operator elements are given in terms of the trigonometric weight functions for the vector representation, independent of the representation of the $L$-operator. For rank one case, our proof also gives a conceptual understanding why the coefficients can also be expressed using the Izergin-Korepin determinants. As a related result, by specializing expressions for the universal nested Bethe vector by Pakuliak-Ragoucy-Slavnov, we also find a construction of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for the vector representation using different $L$-operator elements from the constructions by Nazarov-Tarasov or Molev. We also present corresponding results for the Yangian $Y_h(\mathfrak{gl}_N)$.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Spectral Curve for $\text{AdS}_3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^3\times \text{S}^1$ strings and the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ Q-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward and discuss a proposal for a Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) describing the planar spectrum of the holographic CFT dual to strings on AdS$_3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^3\times$ S$^1$, a theory with global symmetry $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)^{\oplus 2}$. We focus mainly on the case when the radii of the two spheres are the same, i.e. $\alpha = 1/2$, where the symmetry reduces to $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, our proposal is based on two copies of an $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$ Q-system, glued through the branch cuts of the Q-functions in a minimal way. We study in detail the ensuing analytic properties of the Q-functions in this proposal.
  Focusing on purely massive excitations, we consider the large worldsheet limit in which the QSC leads to a set of Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) equations, yielding strong constraints on the (so-far unfixed) dressing factors of the worldsheet S-matrix.
  In a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric sector, our proposal is consistent with all previous results on the worldsheet S-matrix. However, in the non-symmetric case, we found a subtle incompatibility between the analytic constraints arising from the proposed QSC, the crossing equations present in the literature, and braiding unitarity.
  We discuss possible explanations for this mismatch: either our minimal QSC proposal does not hold beyond the symmetric sector, or the crossing unitarity equations receive a nontrivial correction that needs to be understood.
  Finally, we also propose a generalisation of the Q-system for the case of $\alpha\neq 1/2$, corresponding to the superalgebra $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$. This novel algebraic structure represents a significant step towards understanding the Quantum Spectral Curve of the entire theory.</description>
