      <title>Mass inflation from rough initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the strong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak, formulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric charged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near extremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely, when non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves propagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned family, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at the Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the possible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In line with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an instability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass inflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing the interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1) initial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to $W^{1, 2}\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q &gt; 2$, along the initial ingoing compact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the black hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference black hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth data suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a ``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected Price law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and rough initial data.</description>

      <title>TDI on the fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), employ synthetic Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) to cancel the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise. The phase readouts at each spacecraft are combined with a carefully designed collection of time delays that cancel the laser frequency noise. The same collection of time delays must be applied to the GW signal models used for analysis, along with geometrical factors that encode the projection of the wave polarization tensor onto the arms of the interferometer. In principle, fully generic TDI calculations require the GW signal model to be evaluated at dozens of delay times for each data sample, a process that would require tens of millions of evaluations for a year-long signal. Here, a new method is presented that cuts the computational cost by a factor of ten thousand compared to a direct implementation at the data sample cadence, while incurring no loss in accuracy. The approach works for completely general spacecraft orbits and any flavor of TDI.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Hysteresis in $f(R)$ Gravity: A Thermodynamic Perspective on Cyclic Bouncing Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08109v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing cosmologies within the framework of $f(R)$ modified gravity theories. Building upon previous studies that explored hysteresis phenomena in braneworld and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we analyze how scalar field dynamics coupled to a modified gravitational background generates asymmetric pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases. This asymmetry manifests as a non-vanishing work integral over complete cosmic cycles, $\oint p\,dV \neq 0$, which we interpret as a fundamental thermodynamic signature of irreversible cyclic evolution. We derive the modified Friedmann equations for a representative $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$ model, establish analytical conditions for bounce and turnaround events, and quantify the thermodynamic work performed during each cycle through comprehensive numerical analysis. Our findings demonstrate that hysteresis effects are generic features of scalar-tensor dynamics in higher-curvature gravity theories and can drive cumulative evolution of the cosmic scale factor across multiple cycles, potentially providing new insights into the resolution of cosmological singularities and the thermodynamic arrow of time in modified gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most active area of research in quantum-gravity phenomenology investigates the possibility of Planck-scale-modified dispersion relations, focusing mainly on two alternative scenarios: the "LIV" scenario, characterized by a specific mechanism of breakdown of relativistic symmetries, and the "DSR" scenario, which preserves overall relativistic invariance but with deformed laws of relativistic transformation. Two recent studies of modified dispersion relations, one relying on Finsler geometry and one based on heuristic reasoning, raised the possibility of potentially observable effects for time dilation and argued that this might apply also to the LIV and DSR scenarios. We observe that the description of Lorentz transformations in the LIV scenario is such that time dilation cannot be modified. The DSR scenario allows for modifications of time dilation, and establishing their magnitude required us to obtain novel results on the effects of finite DSR boosts in the spacetime sector, with results showing in particular that the modification of time dilation is too small for experimental testing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quantum polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may deviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic objects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration also extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark matter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like particles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may have originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse, sustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the so-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium astrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static anisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By including all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation and conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such systems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium configurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions, we find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential is the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor and the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case. This leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.</description>

      <title>GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Metrics with Conventional and Quantized Metric Tensor: Singular or Nonsingular Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate whether the Universe underwent a singularity or maintained a nonsingular state, we carry out analytical and numerical analyses of the evolution of the Raychaudhuri equations in vacuum, alongside homogeneous and nonhomogeneous cosmic backgrounds. The results obtained from the Schwarzschild, Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW), and Einstein--Gilbert--Straus (EGS) metrics are systematically compared. Analyzing the results from both, conventional and quantized metric tensor, it revealed insights into the nature of initial and spatial singularities. Results associated with the Schwarzschild metric demonstrate a positive evolution that corresponds with a reduction in radial distance (nonsingularity). In contrast, the proposed quantization reverses this trend, leading to a negative evolution (singularity). The situation is similar for the FLRW metric, where the suggested quantization results in a positive evolution as cosmic time decreases, in contrast to the classical and conventional metrics, which are associated with negative evolution. The analysis of the EGS metric reveals that classical evolution remains positively oriented, particularly with a reduction in radial distance. Moreover, the introduction of quantized and conventional metric tensors fully retrains the cosmic time dependence. The results obtained are a rightful recognition of the substantial efforts dedicated to the establishment of the Swiss-cheese model, demonstrating that the EGS metric indeed facilitates the temporal and spatial development of our Universe.</description>

      <title>Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. For certain interferometer configurations, small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies, potentially enabling broadband detection at high frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>A discussion on the symmetry of relativistic Vlasov gas and its accretion in Kerr-Newman black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic properties of collisionless Vlasov gas in Kerr-Newman spacetime, focusing on how spacetime symmetries constrain the distribution functions. By establishing the general relationship between distribution functions and constants of motion (mass $m$, energy $E$, angular momentum $L_z$, Carter constant $L$) along with $L$'s conjugate configuration variable $Q^{3}$, we derive the analytical framework for particle dynamics in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. Within the Locally Non-Rotating Frame , we compute key observables -- particle number density, energy density, principal pressures, and accretion rates -- resolving coordinate divergences near the event horizon through geometric rescaling. For a plasma obeying the J\"uttner distribution, asymptotic expressions at spatial infinity are explicitly calculated. Numerical analyses reveal: (1) mass and energy accretion rates exhibit nearly identical parametric dependencies on black hole parameters; (2) extremal Kerr-Newman black holes show monotonic enhancement in mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates with increasing $a$, contrasting with Kerr black hole behavior. These results provide new insights into accretion mechanisms in extreme spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity Black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized thermodynamic extremum relation, as proposed by Goon and Penco, establishes a novel theoretical framework for the study of spacetime thermodynamics. However, extant investigations generally assume that the black hole state parameter is solely a first-order function of the perturbation parameter when exploring the Goon-Penco relation in diverse spacetime contexts. An analytic expression for the perturbation parameter as a function of the black hole entropy can be expressed by treating the black hole mass as constant. The present study addresses this limitation and provides insight into the universal Goon-Penco relation when multiple thermodynamic state parameters behave as higher order functions of the perturbation parameters. Notably, we have not only established a universal relational formula in the case of multiple state variables, but more importantly, we have put forward an innovative conjecture that reveals the existence of a universal relation between displaced thermodynamic quantities in spacetime in the context of an arbitrary black hole. These theoretical breakthroughs are expected to open up new exploration directions for quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Gravitational Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the non-Hermitian scattering of gravitational waves is examined, and their behavior at spectral singularities is discussed. We investigate the non-Hermitian properties of gravitational waves through the construction of a transfer matrix. By examining spectral singularity points obtained from the transfer matrix, we explore the behavior of gravitational waves at these spectral singularity points and compare the theoretical results with observed measurements. Our findings demonstrate that the frequency values of gravitational waves measured on Earth at spectral singularity points exhibit perfect agreement with the corresponding Hubble constant values. This alignment underscores the significance of the non-Hermitian characteristics of gravitational waves. We anticipate that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of non-Hermitian phenomena in gravitational physics and provide a foundation for future studies in the field.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonlinearities on relativistic dynamical tides in compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of a neutron star in a binary inspiral driven by the emission of gravitational waves affects the orbital dynamics and produces a measurable modulation of the waves. Late in the inspiral, a regime of dynamical tides takes over from a prior regime of static tides. A recent analysis by Yu et al. [M.N.R.A.S. 519, 4325 (2022)] reveals that nonlinear aspects of the tidal interaction are important during the regime of dynamical tides. Their theoretical framework is grounded in Newtonian gravity and fluid mechanics, and relies on a representation of the tidal deformation in terms of the star's normal modes of vibration. We confirm their observation in a general relativistic treatment of the tidal deformation of a neutron star, without relying on a mode representation of this deformation. The starting point of our description is a simultaneous time-derivative and nonlinear expansion of the tidal deformation, expressed in terms of three encapsulating constants, the static $k_2$, dynamic $\ddot{k}_2$, and nonlinear $p_2$ tidal constants. We describe the neutron star's deformation in terms of a well-defined quadrupole moment tensor, which is related to the tidal quadrupole moment through a frequency-domain response function $\tilde{k}_2(\omega)$. In a pragmatic extension of our simultaneous expansion, we express this in a form proportional to $(1-\omega^2/\omega_*^2)^{-1}$, the characteristic response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to a driving force of frequency $\omega$, with a natural-frequency parameter $\omega_*$ constructed from the tidal constants. We compute these for polytropic stellar models, and show that the nonlinear constant $p_2$ lowers the frequency parameter by as much as 15% relative to an estimation based on a purely linear treatment of the tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effective Dynamics of Papapetrou Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum effective dynamics of Papapetrou spacetime by using methods from loop quantum gravity. The Papapetrou spacetime is an extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with an extra coupled anti-scalar field. By solving the equations of motion generated by the Hamiltonian constraint for Papapetrou spacetime, we can construct the quantum effective metric. The resulting effective metric for the quantum-corrected Papapetrou spacetime demonstrates the quantum effects inevitably give rise to a new wormhole throat while the classical wormhole throat disappear in the case of extremely small mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>

      <title>Waveform model for the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic and the displacement memory contribution from precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the first phenomenological waveform model which contains the "complete" $\ell=2$ spherical harmonic mode content for gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary black holes with spin precession: The model contains the dominant part of the gravitational wave displacement memory, which manifests in the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic in a co-precessing frame, as well as the oscillatory component of this mode. The model is constructed by twisting up the oscillatory contribution of the mode, as it was previously done for the rest of spherical harmonic modes in IMRPhenomTPHM and the Phenom family of waveform models. Regarding the displacement memory contribution present in the aligned spin (2,0) mode, we discuss a procedure to analytically compute the "precessing memory" in all the $\ell=2$ modes using the integration derived from the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws. The final waveform of the (2,0) mode is then obtained by summing together both contributions. We implement this as an extension of the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTPHM waveform model, and we test its accuracy by comparing against a set of Numerical Relativity simulations. Finally, we employ the model to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation injection analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity observables: observation, algebras, and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The questions of describing observables and observation in quantum gravity appear to be centrally important to its physics. A relational approach holds significant promise, and a classification of different types of relational observables (gravitationally dressed, field relational, and more general) is outlined. Plausibly gravitationally dressed observables are particularly closely tied to the fundamental structure of the theory. These may be constructed in the quantum theory to leading order in Newton's constant, and raise important questions about localization of information. Approximate localization is given by a "standard dressing" construction of a "gravitational splitting." It is also argued that such gravitational dressings give a generalization of the crossed product construction, reducing to this and yielding type II von Neumann algebras in special cases. Gravity therefore introduces a significantly more general alteration of the algebraic structure of local quantum field theory, also with apparent connections to holography, but whose implications have not been fully understood. In particular, properties of the algebra of gravitationally dressed observables suggest a possible role for other non-algebraic structure on the Hilbert space for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Magnetised Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic field configuration in the interior of neutron stars and its stability are open problems and may be impacted by the influence of a turbulent cascade within the star. Assessing the impact of turbulent flow with numerical simulations requires incredibly high resolution as well as long lived simulations covering multiple Alfven times. We present a series of simulations of magnetised neutron stars with resolution up to 29m and lasting at their longest 1.2s to assess this issue, the longest lasting and highest resolution such simulations to date. At the highest resolution we find evidence for a turbulent cascade absent in an unmagnetised star which cannot be captured with lower resolution simulations, consistent with Kolmogorov power law scaling. The presence of turbulence triggers an inverse cascade of helicity, while at late times the net helicity appears to vanish, suggesting that a twisted-torus is not formed in the magnetic field. We find that the presence of the magnetic field excites a characteristic quadrupolar oscillation of the density profile at 145 Hz, consistent with Alfvenic modes proposed as the source of quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetars.</description>

      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two class of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, have a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_1 \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed in the name of loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_0(1+C_2\phi^{-2/3})$ also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Strong Gravity Region of Black Holes with eXTP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the novel capabilities of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to study the strong gravity region around stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. eXTP can combine X-ray spectral, timing, and polarimetric techniques to study the accretion process near black holes, measure black hole masses and spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. We show how eXTP can improve the current measurements of black holes of existing X-ray missions and we discuss the scientific questions that can be addressed.</description>

      <title>Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of $\alpha$-attractors in Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power Spectrum with the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 &lt; z &lt;0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.</description>

      <title>One loop corrections to the thermodynamics of near-extremal Kerr-(A)dS black holes from Heun equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute one-loop corrections to the euclidean gravitational path integral of near-extremal (anti-)de Sitter-Kerr black hole in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun equation describing the black hole linear perturbations in the Teukolsky formalism. We show that different near-extremal limits lead to distinct physical properties of the gravitational configuration, as they get described by distinct limiting differential equations. As a result, the light modes emerging in the limit determine different scaling properties in the temperature of the one-loop determinants. We show that the cold case displays distinctive universal log(T) corrections to the entropy of the system, including the ultracold regime. On the contrary, these do not appear in the limit in which the event horizon superimposes onto the cosmological one. In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, a further check is performed by comparison with the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula.</description>

      <title>Finslerian lightconvex boundaries: applications to causal simplicity and the space of cone geodesics $\mathcal{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our outcome is structured in the following sequence: (1) a general result for indefinite Finslerian manifolds with boundary $(M,L)$ showing the equivalence between local and infinitesimal (time, light or space) convexities for the boundary $\partial M$, (2) for any cone structure $(M,\mathcal{C})$ which is globally hyperbolic with timelike boundary, the equivalence among: (a) the boundary $\partial M$ is lightconvex, (b) the interior $\mathring{M}$ is causally simple and (c) the space of the cone (null) geodesics $\mathcal{N}$ of $(\mathring{M},\mathcal{C})$ is Hausdorff, (3) in this case, the manifold structure of $\mathcal{N}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of elements in $\partial M$ and a smooth Cauchy hypersurface $S$, (4) the known results and examples about Hausdorfness of $\mathcal{N}$ are revisited and extended, leading to the notion of {\em causally simple spacetime with $T_2$-lightspace} as a step in the causal ladder below global hyperbolicity.
  The results are significant for relativistic (Lorentz) spacetimes and the writing allows one either to be introduced in Finslerian technicalities or to skip them. In particular, asymptotically AdS spacetimes become examples where the $C^{1,1}$ conformal extensions at infinity yield totally lightgeodesic boundaries, and all the results above apply.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave timbre, the relative amplitude and phase of the different frequency harmonics, can change due to interactions with low-mass halos. We focus on binaries in the LISA range and find that the integrated lens effect of cold dark matter structures can be used to probe the existence of $M_{\rm v}\lesssim 10\, M_{\odot}$ halos if a single binary with eccentricity $e=0.3-0.6$ is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio $100 - 10^3$ and it is at $z_s=0.5$.</description>

      <title>Stability and quasinormal modes for black holes with time-dependent scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions with time-dependent (scalar) hair in scalar-tensor theories. Known exact solutions exist for such theories at the background level, where the metric takes on a standard GR form (e.g. Schwarzschild-de Sitter), but these solutions are generically plagued by instabilities. Recently, a new such solution was identified in arXiv:2310.11919, in which the time-dependent scalar background profile is qualitatively different from previous known exact solutions - specifically, the canonical kinetic term for the background scalar $X$ is not constant in this solution. We investigate the stability of this new solution by analysing odd parity perturbations, identifying a bound placed by stability and the resulting surviving parameter space. We extract the quasinormal mode spectrum predicted by the theory, identifying a shift of quasinormal mode frequencies and damping times compared to GR. We forecast constraints on these shifts (and the single effective parameter $\hat\beta$ controlling them) from current and future gravitational wave experiments, finding constraints at up to the ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ level for LVK and LISA/TianQin, respectively. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the Kerr black hole interior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a purely physical-space analysis, we prove the precise oscillatory blow-up asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field in the interior of a subextremal Kerr black hole. In particular, this work gives a new proof of the blueshift instability of the Kerr Cauchy horizon against linearized gravitational perturbations that was first shown by Sbierski \cite{sbierski}. In that sense, this work supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. The proof is an extension to the Teukolsky equation of the work \cite{scalarMZ} by Ma and Zhang that treats the scalar wave equation in the interior of Kerr. The analysis relies on the generic polynomial decay on the event horizon of solutions of the Teukolsky equation that arise from compactly supported initial data, as recently proved by Ma and Zhang \cite{pricelaw} and Millet \cite{millet} in subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity I: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with five future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the equation of state during perturbative reheating and its impact on the inflationary tensor perturbation spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of inflationary tensor perturbations is one of the very few available probes of the post-inflationary reheating epoch, and it is strongly influenced by the Universe's equation of state during this period. In the current era of precision cosmology, an accurate estimation of this primordial tensor perturbation spectrum is crucial. Unlike the conventional assumption of a constant equation of state during the perturbative reheating phase, in this work we dynamically calculate the time evolution of the reheating equation of state for different values of the inflaton decay rates including their possible time-dependence in some cases. We further investigate its impact on the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations, focusing on two different inflationary potentials of the E-model {\alpha}-attractor class, with n=1 and n=3. Using this approach, our results indicate that the inflationary tensor perturbations can be enhanced (or suppressed) by a factor of {\sim} 1.5-3 compared to standard calculations assuming a constant inflaton equation of state. Such a variation arises because the evolution of the comoving horizon differs in the two approaches, causing different comoving momentum modes to re-enter the horizon at different times and undergo distinct evolutions.</description>

      <title>Searching for the classical version of Hawking radiation and screening of Coulomb field by the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the existence of a classical version of Hawking radiation - solutions to classical field equations that consist solely of outgoing waves, in the spacetime of a collapsing black hole. The non-static nature of the corresponding metric results in the absence of energy conservation for matter, which could otherwise a priori prohibit such solutions. A specific and simple scenario is considered: a black hole formation as a result of the collapse of a thin shell, which is not necessarily dust-like. In the corresponding spacetime, we study solutions of the equations for a real massless scalar field that take the form of purely outgoing waves. In addition to the homogeneous equation, we also examine the case of a constant point source of the field located at the symmetry center. The general solution outside the shell is expressed in terms of the confluent Heun function, while the equations inside the shell and the matching conditions at its surface are formulated as an integral equation. The analysis of various solution asymptotics enables the reduction of the integral equation to a matrix equation, which is subsequently solved numerically.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we construct a broad family of spacetimes with spherically symmetric thin shells in unimodular gravity. We present the framework for the analysis of the dynamical stability of the configurations under perturbations preserving the symmetry. In particular, we consider two different scenarios in which the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor is allowed; in both the spacetime has a thin shell with charge surrounding vacuum. Our constructions avoid the existence of event horizons and singularities. In both cases, we have obtained stable configurations for suitable values of the parameters. We compare our results with those corresponding to general relativity, finding some differences in the matter content and in the stability regions in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Black hole images under spherical-shell and circular-annulus accretion models in Schwarzschild spacetime: a semianalytical approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the static and infalling spherical-shell models of optically thin accretion on Schwarzschild black hole, the formulas for the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer are derived, and by taking the monochromatic emission pattern with a $1/r^{2}$ radial profile as example, the black hole images for the spherical shell with different boundaries are plotted. For these BH images, the geometric and luminosity features are summarized, and the qualitative explanations of the luminosity variations between the static and infalling spherical-shell models are provided. A notable feature of the black hole image in the infalling spherical-shell model is that when the inner boundary of the spherical shell is far from the bound photon orbit, the observed luminosity near the exterior of the shadow is enhanced. The circular-annulus models of optically and geometrically thin accretion on Schwarzschild black hole are further explored. For a lightlike geodesic, the analytical forms of the transfer functions working for all impact parameter values are first given, and the redshift factors in the static, infalling, and rotating circular-annulus models are then deduced. With these results, in the three situations, the formulas for the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer viewing the circular annulus at an inclination angle are derived, and the corresponding black hole images for each emission pattern provided in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{100} (2019) 024018 are plotted. Finally, for the BH images of arbitrary order, the geometric and luminosity features are also summarized, and the qualitative explanations of the luminosity variations between different CA models are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eikonal limit of black hole quasinormal modes (the large multipole limit $\ell \gg 1$) can be realized geometrically as a next-to-leading order solution to the geometric optics approximation, and also as linear fluctuations about the Penrose limit plane wave adapted to the lightring. Extending this interpretation beyond the linear order in perturbation theory requires a robust understanding of quadratic quasinormal modes for large values of $\ell$. We analyze numerically the relative excitation of quadratic to linear quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black holes, with two independent methods. Our results suggest that the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes for the $\ell \times \ell \to 2\ell$ channel converges towards a finite value for large $\ell$, in sharp contrast with a recent proposal inspired by the Penrose limit perspective. On the other hand, the $2 \times \ell \to \ell + 2$ channel seems to have a linearly growing ratio. Nevertheless, we show that there is no breakdown of black hole perturbation theory for physically realistic initial data.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>

Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet f(G) gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R, G, T) = \alpha_1 G + \alpha_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha_3 \sqrt{-T}$, where $\alpha_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.</description>

      <title>Vacuum birefringence and the Schwinger effect in (3+1) de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.08977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In de Sitter space, the current induced by an electric field in vacuum is known to feature certain peculiarities, such as infrared hyperconductivity for light bosons in weak electric fields. Moreover, negative conductivity has been claimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions of any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the limit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which are not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here we explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative conductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not exponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are unrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they correspond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular for vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially suppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue that for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not correspond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the electric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale. We conclude that none of the above mentioned negative contributions can cause an instability such as the spontaneous growth of an electric field in de Sitter, at least within the weak coupling regime. Third, we provide a heuristic derivation of infrared hyperconductivity, which clarifies its possible role in magnetogenesis scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of Lorentzian conformal structures on the canonical circle bundle of a partially integrable contact almost Cauchy-Riemann manifold. This builds on previous work by Leitner, who generalised Fefferman's construction associated to a CR manifold to the non-involutive case. We provide characterisations of these conformal structures and show that they admit distinguished pure spinor fields. We introduce exact 'perturbations' of such Fefferman spaces by a semi-basic one-form, which can be suitably interpreted as a tuple of weighted tensors on the almost CR manifold. The resulting perturbed conformal space is an instance of a so-called nearly Robinson manifold introduced recently by Fino, Leistner and the present author. We investigate the existence of metrics in these conformal classes which satisfy appropriate subsystems of the Einstein equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of almost Lorentzian densities, which include Gover's almost Einstein scales as a special case. In particular, in dimensions greater than four, almost Einstein scales always arise from so-called CR-Einstein structures, almost CR analogues of Einstein metrics. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a perturbed Fefferman space to be conformally flat on the zero set of an almost Einstein scale. We construct an explicit example of a CR-Einstein structure on a strictly almost CR five-manifold based on a strictly almost Kaehler-Einstein four-manifold due to Nurowski and Przanowski.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topological classes of the rotating, accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers for the rotating, accelerating neutral black hole and its AdS extension, as well as the rotating, accelerating charged black hole and its AdS extension. We find that the topological number of an asymptotically flat accelerating black hole consistently differs by one from that of its non-accelerating counterpart. Furthermore, we show that for an asymptotically AdS accelerating black hole, the topological number is reduced by one compared to its non-accelerating AdS counterpart. In addition, we demonstrate that within the framework of general relativity, the acceleration parameter and the negative cosmological constant each independently add one to the topological number. However, when both factors are present, their effects neutralize each other, resulting in no overall change to the topological number.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to a significant hardening phase transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by gravitational-wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. We model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to scouring by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic center density of around $10^6\,M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$ is favored across most of the parameter space, shedding light on environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on color-flavor locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations play a crucial role in understanding the processes within compact stars. A recent study measured the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating its mass at $M=0.77^{+0.20}_ {-0.17} \ M_\odot$ and radius at $R = 10.40^{+0.86}_{-0.78} \ \mathrm{km}$, identifying it as the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of approximately $1.17 \ M_\odot$, raising the question of whether this object is a typical neutron star or possibly an "exotic" star. To investigate, we utilize the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 measurement with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we construct hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, introducing a phase transition through Maxwell construction. Our findings reveal that absolutely stable CFL quark matter effectively explains all observed measurements, including the central object of HESS J1731-347, whereas hybrid models incorporating the CFL MIT Bag model cannot account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.</description>

      <title>Observable-based reformulation of time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational-wave observatories utilize a postprocessing technique known as time-delay interferometry (TDI) to reduce the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise by around 8 orders of magnitude. While, in its traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent studies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic metrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital delays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays obtained from prelaunch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing scheme presented in this article treats onboard delays as an integral part of the TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it directly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard measurements, especially pseudo-random-noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The only onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR delays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable digital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in postprocessing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior interspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for potential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement systems. The proposed observable-based formulation closely relates TDI to the actual metrology system, and it clearly outlines how to manage onboard measurements in postprocessing. Hence, it is expected to lead to fundamental advancements in TDI, providing both conceptual completeness and unique practical benefits.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>
