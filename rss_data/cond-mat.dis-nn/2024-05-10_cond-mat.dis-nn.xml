      <title>Topological conditions drive stability in meta-ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a global level, ecological communities are being perturbed at an unprecedented rate by human activities and environmental instabilities. Yet, we understand little about what factors facilitate or impede long-term persistence of these communities. While observational studies indicate that increased biodiversity must, somehow, be driving stability, theoretical studies have argued the exact opposite viewpoint instead. This encouraged many researchers to participate in the ongoing diversity-stability debate. Within this context, however, there has been a severe lack of studies that consider spatial features explicitly, even though nearly all habitats are spatially embedded. To this end, we study here the linear stability of meta-ecosystems on networks that describe how discrete patches are connected by dispersal between them. By combining results from random matrix theory and network theory, we are able to show that there are three distinct features that underlie stability: edge density, tendency to triadic closure, and isolation or fragmentation. Our results appear to further indicate that network sparsity does not necessarily reduce stability, and that connections between patches are just as, if not more, important to consider when studying the stability of large ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Analysis of the Anderson Model on Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a renormalization group analysis of the problem of Anderson localization on a Random Regular Graph (RRG) which generalizes the renormalization group of Abrahams, Anderson, Licciardello, and Ramakrishnan to infinite-dimensional graphs. The renormalization group equations necessarily involve two parameters (one being the changing connectivity of sub-trees), but we show that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis is recovered for sufficiently large system sizes for both eigenstates and spectrum observables. We also explain the non-monotonic behavior of dynamical and spectral quantities as a function of the system size for values of disorder close to the transition, by identifying two terms in the beta function of the running fractal dimension of different signs and functional dependence. Our theory provides a simple and coherent explanation for the unusual scaling behavior observed in numerical data of the Anderson model on RRG and of Many-Body Localization.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Mobility Edge in Quantum Sun models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum sun model is an interacting model that exhibits sharp signatures of ergodicity breaking phase transition. Here, we show that the model exhibits a many-body mobility edge. We provide analytical arguments for its existence, complemented by the state-of-the-art numerical simulations analysing gap ratios, Thouless times as well as entanglement entropy of eigenstates. We also introduce the quantum sun model with particle number conservation, and we argue that it shares many similarities with his unrestricted predecessor.</description>

      <title>Network science Ising states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical, combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the $2$D Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the $2$D Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.</description>
