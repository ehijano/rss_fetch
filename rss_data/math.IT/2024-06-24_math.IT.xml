      <title>Age of Information Versions: a Semantic View of Markov Source Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of real-time remote monitoring of a two-state Markov process, where a sensor observes the state of the source and makes a decision on whether to transmit the status updates over an unreliable channel or not. We introduce a modified randomized stationary sampling and transmission policy where the decision to perform sampling occurs probabilistically depending on the current state of the source and whether the system was in a sync state during the previous time slot or not. We then propose two new performance metrics, coined the Version Innovation Age (VIA) and the Age of Incorrect Version (AoIV) and analyze their performance under the modified randomized stationary and other state-of-the-art sampling and transmission policies. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the distribution and the average of VIA, AoIV, and Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) under these policies. Furthermore, we formulate and solve three constrained optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims to minimize the average VIA subject to constraints on the time-averaged sampling cost and time-averaged reconstruction error. In the second and third problems, the objective is to minimize the average AoIV and AoII, respectively, while considering a constraint on the time-averaged sampling cost. Finally, we compare the performance of various sampling and transmission policies and identify the conditions under which each policy outperforms the others in optimizing the proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided MIMO Beamforming: Piece-Wise Near-field Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint active and passive beamforming design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communication systems, adopting a piece-wise near-field channel model. While a traditional near-field channel model, applied without any approximations, offers higher modeling accuracy than a far-field model, it renders the system design more sensitive to channel estimation errors (CEEs). As a remedy, we propose to adopt a piece-wise near-field channel model that leverages the advantages of the near-field approach while enhancing its robustness against CEEs. Our study analyzes the impact of different channel models, including the traditional near-field, the proposed piece-wise near-field and far-field channel models, on the interference distribution caused by CEEs and model mismatches. Subsequently, by treating the interference as noise, we formulate a joint active and passive beamforming design problem to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). The formulated problem is then recast as a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem and a suboptimal algorithm is developed to iteratively update the active and passive beamforming strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that adopting the piece-wise near-field channel model leads to an improved SE compared to both the near-field and far-field models in the presence of CEEs. Furthermore, the proposed piece-wise near-field model achieves a good trade-off between modeling accuracy and system's degrees of freedom (DoF).</description>

      <title>New Upper Bounds for Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The noisy permutation channel is a useful abstraction introduced by Makur for point-to-point communication networks and biological storage. While the asymptotic capacity results exist for this model, the characterization of the second-order asymptotics is not available. Therefore, we analyze the converse bounds for the noisy permutation channel in the finite blocklength regime. To do this, we present a modified minimax meta-converse for noisy permutation channels by symbol relaxation. To derive the second-order asymptotics of the converse bound, we propose a way to use divergence covering in analysis. It enables the observation of the second-order asymptotics and the strong converse via Berry-Esseen type bounds. These two conclusions hold for noisy permutation channels with strictly positive matrices (entry-wise). In addition, we obtain computable bounds for the noisy permutation channel with the binary symmetric channel (BSC), including the original computable converse bound based on the modified minimax meta-converse, the asymptotic expansion derived from our subset covering technique, and the {\epsilon}-capacity result. We find that a smaller crossover probability provides a higher upper bound for a fixed finite blocklength, although the {\epsilon}-capacity is agnostic to the BSC parameter. Finally, numerical results show that the normal approximation shows remarkable precision, and our new converse bound is stronger than previous bounds.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmit Signal Design for Multi-Target MIMO Sensing Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transmit signal optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system for sensing the angle information of multiple targets via their reflected echo signals. We consider a challenging and practical scenario where the angles to be sensed are unknown and random, while their probability information is known a priori for exploitation. First, we establish an analytical framework to quantify the multi-target sensing performance exploiting prior distribution information, by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-squared error (MSE) matrix in sensing multiple unknown and random angles. Then, we formulate and study the transmit sample covariance matrix optimization problem to minimize the PCRB for the sum MSE in estimating all angles. By leveraging Lagrange duality theory, we analytically prove that the optimal transmit covariance matrix has a rank-one structure, despite the multiple angles to be sensed and the continuous feasible range of each angle. Moreover, we propose a sum-of-ratios iterative algorithm which can obtain the optimal solution to the PCRB-minimization problem with low complexity. Numerical results validate our results and the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Wireless Communications: Capacity Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity limits of continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communications are characterized. To this end, an analytically tractable transmission framework is established for both uplink and downlink CAPA systems. Based on this framework, closed-form expressions for the single-user channel capacity are derived. The results are further extended to a multiuser case by characterizing the capacity limits of a two-user channel and proposing the associated capacity-achieving decoding and encoding schemes. 1) For the uplink case, the sum-rate capacity and capacity region, as well as the capacity-achieving detectors, are derived. 2) For the downlink case, the uplink-downlink duality is established by deriving the uplink-to-downlink and downlink-to-uplink transformations under the same power constraint, based on which the optimal power allocation policy and the achieved sum-rate capacity and capacity region are characterized. To gain further insights, several case studies are presented by specializing the derived results into various array structures, including the planar CAPA, linear CAPA, and planar spatially discrete array (SPDA). Numerical results are provided to reveal that: i) the channel capacity achieved by CAPAs converges towards a finite upper bound as the aperture size increases; and ii) CAPAs offer significant capacity gains over the conventional SPDAs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamical sampling problem on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ driven by a convolution operator defined by a convolution kernel. This problem is inspired by the need to recover a bandlimited heat diffusion field from space-time samples and its discrete analogue. In this book chapter, we review recent results in the finite-dimensional case and extend these findings to the infinite-dimensional case, focusing on the study of the density of space-time sampling sets.</description>

      <title>On the Computing and Communication Tradeoff in Reasoning-Based Multi-User Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) is recognized as a promising approach for enabling reliable communication with minimal data transfer while maintaining seamless connectivity for a group of wireless users. Unlocking the advantages of SC for multi-user cases requires revisiting how communication and computing resources are allocated. This reassessment should consider the reasoning abilities of end-users, enabling receiving nodes to fill in missing information or anticipate future events more effectively. Yet, state-of-the-art SC systems primarily focus on resource allocation through compression based on semantic relevance, while overlooking the underlying data generation mechanisms and the tradeoff between communications and computing. Thus, they cannot help prevent a disruption in connectivity. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework for computing and communication resource allocation is proposed that seeks to demonstrate how SC systems with reasoning capabilities at the end nodes can improve reliability in an end-to-end multi-user wireless system with intermittent communication links. Towards this end, a novel reasoning-aware SC system is proposed for enabling users to utilize their local computing resources to reason the representations when the communication links are unavailable. To optimize communication and computing resource allocation in this system, a noncooperative game is formulated among multiple users whose objective is to maximize the effective semantic information (computed as a product of reliability and semantic information) while controlling the number of semantically relevant links that are disrupted. Simulation results show that the proposed reasoning-aware SC system results in at least a $16.6\%$ enhancement in throughput and a significant improvement in reliability compared to classical communications systems that do not incorporate reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use an information-theoretic argument due to O'Connell (2000) to prove that every sufficiently symmetric event concerning a countably infinite family of independent and identically distributed random variables is deterministic (i.e., has a probability of either 0 or 1). The i.i.d. condition can be relaxed. This result encompasses the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law and the ergodicity of the Bernoulli process, but also applies to other scenarios such as infinite random graphs and simple renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Overloaded Multi-group Multicast: A First Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-group multicast (MGM) is an increasingly important form of multi-user wireless communications with several potential applications, such as video streaming, federated learning, safety-critical vehicular communications, etc. Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a powerful interference management technique that can, in principle, achieve higher data rates and greater fairness for all types of multi-user wireless communications, including MGM. This paper presents the first-ever experimental evaluation of RSMA-based MGM, as well as the first-ever three-way comparison of RSMA-based, Space Divison Multiple Access (SDMA)-based and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based MGM. Using a measurement setup involving a two-antenna transmitter and two groups of two single-antenna users per group, we consider the problem of realizing throughput (max-min) fairness across groups for each of three multiple access schemes, over nine experimental cases in a line-of-sight environment capturing varying levels of pathloss difference and channel correlation across the groups. Over these cases, we observe that RSMA-based MGM achieves fairness at a higher throughput for each group than SDMA- and NOMA-based MGM. These findings validate RSMA-based MGM's promised gains from the theoretical literature.</description>

      <title>Critical point representation of the mutual information in the sparse stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the community structure in the stochastic block model. We aim to describe the mutual information between the observed network and the actual community structure as the number of nodes diverges while the average degree of a given node remains bounded. Our main contribution is a representation of the limit of this quantity, assuming it exists, as an explicit functional evaluated at a critical point of that functional. While we mostly focus on the two-community setting for clarity, we expect our method to be robust to model generalizations. We also present an example involving four communities where we show the invalidity of a plausible candidate variational formula for this limit.</description>

      <title>On Naive Mean-Field Approximation for high-dimensional canonical GLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the validity of the Naive Mean Field (NMF) approximation for canonical GLMs with product priors. This setting is challenging due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood and the prior. Using the theory of non-linear large deviations (Austin 2019, Chatterjee, Dembo 2016, Eldan 2018), we derive sufficient conditions for the tightness of the NMF approximation to the log-normalizing constant of the posterior distribution. As a second contribution, we establish that under minor conditions on the design, any NMF optimizer is a product distribution where each component is a quadratic tilt of the prior. In turn, this suggests novel iterative algorithms for fitting the NMF optimizer to the target posterior. Finally, we establish that if the NMF optimization problem has a "well-separated maximizer", then this optimizer governs the probabilistic properties of the posterior. Specifically, we derive credible intervals with average coverage guarantees, and characterize the prediction performance on an out-of-sample datapoint in terms of this dominant optimizer.</description>

      <title>On Lattice-Code based Multiple Access: Uplink Architecture and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a lattice-code based multiple-access (LCMA) framework, and develops a package of processing techniques that are essential to its practical implementation. In the uplink, $K$ users encode their messages with the same ring coded modulation of $2^{m}$-PAM signaling. With it, the integer sum of multiple codewords belongs to the $n$-dimension lattice of the base code. Such property enables efficient \textit{algebraic binning} for computing linear combinations of $K$ users' messages. For the receiver, we devise two new algorithms, based on linear physical-layer network coding and linear filtering, to calculate the symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities (APPs) w.r.t. the $K$ streams of linear codeword combinations. The resultant APP streams are forwarded to the $q$-ary belief-propagation decoders, which parallelly compute $K$ streams of linear message combinations. Finally, by multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix, all users' messages are recovered. Even with single-stage parallel processing, LCMA is shown to support a remarkably larger number of users and exhibits improved frame error rate (FER) relative to existing NOMA systems such as IDMA and SCMA. Further, we propose a new multi-stage LCMA receiver relying on \emph{generalized matrix inversion}. With it, a near-capacity performance is demonstrated for a wide range of system loads. Numerical results demonstrate that the number of users that LCMA can support is no less than 350\% of the length of the spreading sequence or number of receive antennas. Since LCMA relaxes receiver iteration, off-the-shelf channel codes in standards can be directly utilized, avoiding the compatibility and convergence issue of channel code and detector in IDMA and SCMA.</description>

      <title>A Low-Overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI Feedback Framework for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for downlink precoding in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). However, obtaining CSI through feedback from the user equipment (UE) becomes challenging with the increasing scale of antennas and subcarriers and leads to extremely high CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based methods have emerged for compressing CSI but these methods generally require substantial collected samples and thus pose practical challenges. Moreover, existing deep learning methods also suffer from dramatically growing feedback overhead owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI feedback. To address these issues, we propose a low-overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for massive MIMO systems. An incorporation-extrapolation scheme for eigenvector-based CSI feedback is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead. Then, to alleviate the necessity of extensive collected samples and enable few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation (KDDA) method and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data augmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Experimental results based on the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead by 64 times compared with existing methods while maintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundred collected samples.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As indicated by the title, this paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $[0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that the $q$-stability of a set can be expressed in terms of the R\'enyi divergence between the true output distribution and the target distribution in a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where anti-contractivity introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a unified approach for analyzing the stability of the phaseless operator for both amplitude and intensity measurement on an arbitrary geometric set, thus characterizing the robust performance of phase retrieval via the empirical minimization method. We introduce the random embedding of concave lifting operators in tangent space to characterize the unified analysis of any geometric set. Similarly, we investigate the structured matrix recovery problem through the robust injectivity of a linear rank one measurement operator on an arbitrary matrix set. The core of our analysis is to establish a unified empirical chaos process characterization for various matrix sets. Talagrand's $\gamma_{\alpha}$-functionals are introduced to characterize the connection between the geometric constraints and the number of measurements needed to guarantee stability or robust injectivity. Finally, we construct adversarial noise to demonstrate the sharpness of the recovery bounds in the above two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Tradeoff Based on $\alpha$-lift</title>

Abstract: Information density and its exponential form, known as lift, play a central role in information privacy leakage measures. $\alpha$-lift is the power-mean of lift, which is tunable between the worst-case measure max-lift ($\alpha=\infty$) and more relaxed versions ($\alpha&lt;\infty$). This paper investigates the optimization problem of the privacy-utility tradeoff (PUT) where $\alpha$-lift and mutual information are privacy and utility measures, respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of $\alpha$-lift for $\alpha&lt;\infty$, finding the optimal solution is challenging. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to estimate the optimal utility for each value of $\alpha$, inspired by the optimal solution for $\alpha=\infty$ and the convexity of $\alpha$-lift with respect to the lift, which we prove. The numerical results show the efficacy of the algorithm and indicate the effective range of $\alpha$ and privacy budget $\varepsilon$ with good PUT performance.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-Resilient Trades for Dynamic Service Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11075</link>

Abstract: A combinatorial trade is a pair of sets of blocks of elements that can be exchanged while preserving relevant subset intersection constraints. The class of balanced and swap-robust minimal trades was proposed in [1] for exchanging blocks of data chunks stored on distributed storage systems in an access- and load-balanced manner. More precisely, data chunks in the trades of interest are labeled by popularity ranks and the blocks are required to have both balanced overall popularity and stability properties with respect to swaps in chunk popularities. The original construction of such trades relied on computer search and paired balanced sets obtained through iterative combining of smaller sets that have provable stability guarantees. To reduce the substantial gap between the results of prior approaches and the known theoretical lower bound, we present new analytical upper and lower bounds on the minimal disbalance of blocks introduced by limited-magnitude popularity ranking swaps. Our constructive and near-optimal approach relies on pairs of graphs whose vertices are two balanced sets with edges/arcs that capture the balance and potential balance changes induced by limited-magnitude popularity swaps. In particular, we show that if we start with carefully selected balanced trades and limit the magnitude of rank swaps to one, the new upper and lower bound on the maximum block disbalance caused by a swap only differ by a factor of $1.07$. We also extend these results for larger popularity swap magnitudes.</description>
