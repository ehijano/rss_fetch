      <title>Comparisons of Sequential Experiments for Additively Separable Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three natural classes of dynamic decision problems; 1. additively separable problems, 2. discounted problems, and 3. discounted problems for a fixed discount factor; we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for one sequential experiment to dominate another in the sense that the dominant experiment is preferred to the other for any decision problem in the specified class. We use these results to study the timing of information arrival in additively separable problems.</description>

      <title>FACT or Fiction: Can Truthful Mechanisms Eliminate Federated Free Riding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard federated learning (FL) approaches are vulnerable to the free-rider dilemma: participating agents can contribute little to nothing yet receive a well-trained aggregated model. While prior mechanisms attempt to solve the free-rider dilemma, none have addressed the issue of truthfulness. In practice, adversarial agents can provide false information to the server in order to cheat its way out of contributing to federated training. In an effort to make free-riding-averse federated mechanisms truthful, and consequently less prone to breaking down in practice, we propose FACT. FACT is the first federated mechanism that: (1) eliminates federated free riding by using a penalty system, (2) ensures agents provide truthful information by creating a competitive environment, and (3) encourages agent participation by offering better performance than training alone. Empirically, FACT avoids free-riding when agents are untruthful, and reduces agent loss by over 4x.</description>

      <title>Optimized Cost Per Click in Online Advertising: A Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Optimized Cost Per Click (OCPC) and Optimized Cost Per Mille (OCPM) have emerged as the most widely adopted pricing models in the online advertising industry. However, the existing literature has yet to identify the specific conditions under which these models outperform traditional pricing models like Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA). To fill the gap, this paper builds an economic model that compares OCPC with CPC and CPA theoretically, which incorporates out-site scenarios and outside options as two key factors. Our analysis reveals that OCPC can effectively replace CPA by tackling the problem of advertisers strategically manipulating conversion reporting in out-site scenarios where conversions occur outside the advertising platform. Furthermore, OCPC exhibits the potential to surpass CPC in platform payoffs by providing higher advertiser payoffs and consequently attracting more advertisers. However, if advertisers have less competitive outside options and consistently stay in the focal platform, the platform may achieve higher payoffs using CPC. Our findings deliver valuable insights for online advertising platforms in selecting optimal pricing models, and provide recommendations for further enhancing their payoffs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze OCPC from an economic perspective. Moreover, our analysis can be applied to the OCPM model as well.</description>

      <title>Share-Based Fairness for Arbitrary Entitlements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of indivisible items to agents that have arbitrary entitlements to the items. Every agent $i$ has a valuation function $v_i$ and an entitlement $b_i$, where entitlements sum up to~1. Which allocation should one choose in situations in which agents fail to agree on one acceptable fairness notion? We study this problem in the case in which each agent focuses on the value she gets, and fairness notions are restricted to be {\em share based}. A {\em share} $s$ is an function that maps every $(v_i,b_i)$ to a value $s(v_i,b_i)$, representing the minimal value $i$ should get, and $s$ is {\em feasible} if it is always possible to give every agent $i$ value of at least $s(v_i,b_i)$.
  Our main result is that for additive valuations over goods there is an allocation that gives every agent at least half her share value, regardless of which feasible share-based fairness notion the agent wishes to use. Moreover, the ratio of half is best possible. More generally, we provide tight characterizations of what can be achieved, both ex-post (as single allocations) and ex-ante (as expected values of distributions of allocations), both for goods and for chores. We also show that for chores one can achieve the ex-ante and ex-post guarantees simultaneously (a ``best of both world" result), whereas for goods one cannot.</description>

      <title>The comparative statics of persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07474v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the canonical persuasion model, comparative statics has been an open question. We answer it, delineating which shifts of the sender's interim payoff lead her optimally to choose a more informative signal. Our first theorem identifies a coarse notion of 'increased convexity' that we show characterises those shifts of the sender's interim payoff that lead her optimally to choose no less informative signals. To strengthen this conclusion to 'more informative' requires further assumptions: our second theorem identifies the necessary and sufficient condition on the sender's interim payoff, which strictly generalises the 'S' shape commonly imposed in the literature. We identify conditions under which increased alignment of interests between sender and receiver lead to comparative statics, and study a number of applications.</description>

      <title>Reputational Algorithm Aversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People are often reluctant to incorporate information produced by algorithms into their decisions, a phenomenon called ``algorithm aversion''. This paper shows how algorithm aversion arises when the choice to follow an algorithm conveys information about a human's ability. I develop a model in which workers make forecasts of an uncertain outcome based on their own private information and an algorithm's signal. Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill. The model provides a fully rational microfoundation for algorithm aversion that aligns with the broad concern that AI systems will displace many types of workers.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Adversarial Games are Zero-Sum: An Elaboration of a Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that every two-person adversarial game is an affine transformation of a zero-sum game is traceable to Luce-Raiffa (1957) and made explicit in Aumann (1987). Recent work of (ADP) Adler-Daskalakis-Papadimitriou (2009), and of Raimondo (2023) in increasing generality, proves what has so far remained a conjecture. We present two proofs of an even more general formulation: the first draws on multilinear utility theory developed by Fishburn-Roberts (1978); the second is a consequence of the ADP proof itself for a special case of a two-player game with a set of three actions.</description>

      <title>Risk Propagation in Endogenous Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the endogenous formation of supply chains and its consequences for disruption propagation. In production networks where upstream risk is highly correlated and supplier relationships are not observable, the marginal risk reduction of adding an additional supplier is low, because this additional supplier's risk is likely to be correlated to that of the firm's existing suppliers. This channel reduces firm incentives to diversify, which gives rise to inefficiently fragile production networks.
  By solving the social planner problem, I show that, if the risk reduction experienced downstream resulting from upstream diversification were to be internalised by upstream firms, endogenous production networks would be resilient to most levels of risk. Furthermore, I show that imperfect information yields inefficient but more robust supply chains. Despite its stylised form, the model identifies the trade-off firms face when diversifying risk and isolates the mechanism that aggregates these decisions into a production network. Furthermore, it maps the conditions of the trade-off, such as expected profits of the firm or the sourcing costs, to the properties of the production network.</description>

      <title>Discrete &amp; Bayesian Transaction Fee Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07793v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies employ auction-esque transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs) to allocate transactions to blocks, and to determine how much fees miners can collect from transactions. Several impossibility results show that TFMs that satisfy a standard set of "good" properties obtain low revenue, and in certain cases, no revenue at all. In this work, we circumvent previous impossibilities by showing that when desired TFM properties are reasonably relaxed, simple mechanisms can obtain strictly positive revenue. By discretizing fees, we design a TFM that satisfies the extended TFM desiderata: it is dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC), myopic miner incentive-compatible (MMIC), side-contract-proof (SCP) and obtains asymptotically optimal revenue (i.e., linear in the number of allocated bids), and optimal revenue when considering separable TFMs. If instead of discretizing fees we relax the DSIC and SCP properties, we show that Bitcoin's TFM, after applying the revelation principle, is Bayesian incentive-compatible (BIC), MMIC, off-chain-agreement (OCA) proof, and approximately revenue-optimal. We reach our results by characterizing the class of multi-item OCA-proof mechanisms, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Mechanisms That Incentivize Federated Participation and Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge device participation in federating learning (FL) is typically studied through the lens of device-server communication (e.g., device dropout) and assumes an undying desire from edge devices to participate in FL. As a result, current FL frameworks are flawed when implemented in realistic settings, with many encountering the free-rider dilemma. In a step to push FL towards realistic settings, we propose RealFM: the first federated mechanism that (1) realistically models device utility, (2) incentivizes data contribution and device participation, (3) provably removes the free-rider dilemma, and (4) relaxes assumptions on data homogeneity and data sharing. Compared to previous FL mechanisms, RealFM allows for a non-linear relationship between model accuracy and utility, which improves the utility gained by the server and participating devices. On real-world data, RealFM improves device and server utility, as well as data contribution, by over 3 and 4 magnitudes respectively compared to baselines.</description>
