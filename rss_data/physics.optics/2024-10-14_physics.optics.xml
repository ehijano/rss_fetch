      <title>Dual-band Photonic Filters with Wide Tunable Range Using Chirped Sampled Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a photonic filter featuring dual independently tunable passbands. Employing the reconstruction equivalent-chirp technique, we designed linearly chirped sampled Bragg gratings with two equivalent phase shifts positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the cavity, thus introducing two passbands in the +1st channel. Leveraging the significant thermo-optic effect of silicon, dual-band tuning is achieved via micro-heaters integrated on the chip surface. By tuning the injection currents ranging from 0 to 35 mA into the micro-heaters, the filter exhibits a wide range of dual-wavelength filtering performance, with the frequency interval between the two passbands adjustable from 37.2 GHz to 186.1 GHz.</description>

      <title>Zonal shape reconstruction for Shack-Hartmann sensors and deflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some metrological means, such as Shack-Hartmann, deflectometry sensors or fringe projection profilometry, measure the shape of an optical surface indirectly from slope measurements. Zonal shape reconstruction, a method to reconstruct shape with a high number of degrees of freedom, is used for all of these applications. It has risen in interest with the use of deflectometers for the acquisition of high resolution slope data for optical manufacturing, especially because shape reconstruction is limiting in terms of shape estimation error. Zonal reconstruction methods all rely on the choice of a data formation model, a basis on which the shape will be decomposed, and an estimator. In this paper, we first study the canonical Fried and Southwell models of the literature and analyze their limitations. We show that modeling the slope measurement by a point-wise derivative as they both do can induce a bias on the shape estimation, and that the bases on which the shape is decomposed are imposed because of this assumption. In the second part of this paper, we propose to build an unbiased model of the data formation, without constraints on the choice of the decomposition basis. We then compare these models to the canonical models of Fried and Southwell. Lastly, we perform a regularized MAP reconstruction, and compare the performance in terms of total shape error of this method to the state of the art for the Southwell and Fried models, first by simulation, then on experimental data. We demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms the canonical models in terms of total shape reconstruction error on a deflectometry measurement of the high-frequency content of a freeform mirror.</description>

      <title>Detecting collagen by machine learning improved photoacoustic spectral analysis for breast cancer diagnostics: feasibility studies with murine models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collagen, a key structural component of the extracellular matrix, undergoes significant remodeling during carcinogenesis. However, the important role of collagen levels in breast cancer diagnostics still lacks effective in vivo detection techniques to provide a deeper understanding. This study presents photoacoustic spectral analysis improved by machine learning as a promising non-invasive diagnostic method, focusing on exploring collagen as a salient biomarker. Murine model experiments revealed more profound associations of collagen with other cancer components than in normal tissues. Moreover, an optimal set of feature wavelengths was identified by a genetic algorithm for enhanced diagnostic performance, among which 75% were from collagen-dominated absorption wavebands. Using optimal spectra, the diagnostic algorithm achieved 72% accuracy, 66% sensitivity, and 78% specificity, surpassing full-range spectra by 6%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. The proposed photoacoustic methods examine the feasibility of offering valuable biochemical insights into existing techniques, showing great potential for early-stage cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Noise Constraints for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the parameter space of a non-Hermitian system where eigenenergies and eigenstates coincide. They hold promise for enhancing sensing applications, but this is limited by the divergence of shot noise near EPs. According to recent studies, EP sensors operating in the nonlinear regime may avoid these limitations. By analyzing an exemplary nonlinear system, we show that the interplay of noise and nonlinearity introduces previously-unidentified obstacles to enhanced sensing. The noise effectively displaces the EP in parameter space and reduces its order, thereby eliminating the sought-for divergence in the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise near the nonlinear EP experiences a stronger divergence than predicted by standard calculations of the Petermann noise factor, due to the properties of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian governing the fluctuations. Our semi-analytical estimates for the noise level agree quantitatively with the results of stochastic numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Integrated adaptive coherent LiDAR for 4D bionic vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a ubiquitous tool to provide precise spatial awareness in various perception environments. A bionic LiDAR that can mimic human-like vision by adaptively gazing at selected regions of interest within a broad field of view is crucial to achieve high-resolution imaging in an energy-saving and cost-effective manner. However, current LiDARs based on stacking fixed-wavelength laser arrays and inertial scanning have not been able to achieve the desired dynamic focusing patterns and agile scalability simultaneously. Moreover, the ability to synchronously acquire multi-dimensional physical parameters, including distance, direction, Doppler, and color, through seamless fusion between multiple sensors, still remains elusive in LiDAR. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a bio-inspired frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR system with dynamic and scalable gazing capability. Our chip-scale LiDAR system is built using hybrid integrated photonic solutions, where a frequency-chirped external cavity laser provides broad spectral tunability, while on-chip electro-optic combs with elastic channel spacing allow customizable imaging granularity. Using the dynamic zoom-in capability and the coherent FMCW scheme, we achieve a state-of-the-art resolution of 0.012 degrees, providing up to 15 times the resolution of conventional 3D LiDAR sensors, with 115 equivalent scanning lines and 4D parallel imaging. We further demonstrate cooperative sensing between our adaptive coherent LiDAR and a camera to enable high-resolution color-enhanced machine vision.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile Tuning of Cryogenic Optical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, ultra-low-noise sensing, and high-energy physics experiments often rely on superconducting circuits or semiconductor qubits and devices operating at deep cryogenic temperatures (4K and below). Photonic integrated circuits and interconnects have been demonstrated for scalable communications and optical domain transduction in these systems. Due to energy and area constraints, many of these devices need enhanced light-matter interaction, provided by photonic resonators. A key challenge, however, for using these resonators is the sensitivity of resonance wavelength to process variations and thermal fluctuations. While thermo-optical tuning methods are typically employed at room temperature to mitigate this problem, the thermo-optic effect is ineffective at 4K. To address this issue, we demonstrate a non-volatile approach to tune the resonance of photonic resonators using integrated phase-change materials (PCMs) at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we report a 10Gb/s free-carrier dispersion based resonant photonic modulator that can be tuned in a non-volatile fashion at sub-4K temperatures using a commercial silicon photonics process. This method paves the way for realizing scalable cryogenic integrated photonics with thousands of resonant devices for quantum and high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>

      <title>Optical modeling, solver, and design of wafer-scale single-enantiomer carbon nanotube film and reconfigurable chiral photonic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of circularly polarized light with chiral matter and functional devices enables novel phenomena and applications. Recently, wafer-scale solid-state single-enantiomer carbon nanotube (CNT) films have become feasible and are emerging as a chiral photonic material platform thanks to their quantum-confinement-induced optical properties and facile scalable assembly. However, optical modeling, solver, and device design tools for such materials are non-existent. Here, we prepare wafer-scale single-enantiomer (6,5) and (11,-5) randomly oriented CNT films and create an optical material model based on measured experimental optical spectra. We also implement a highly-parallel graphic-processing-unit accelerated transfer matrix solver for general bi-anisotropic materials and layered structures. Further, we demonstrate reconfigurable chiral photonic devices in a heterostructure with phase change materials through machine learning-enabled efficient gradient-based inverse design and optimization. Our developed full stack of a chiral photonic material and device hardware platform and a corresponding high-performance differential-programming-enabled solver opens the door for future chiral photonic devices and applications based on single-enantiomer CNT films.</description>

      <title>Signal estimation and uncertainties extraction in TeraHertz Time Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) systems have emerged as mature technologies with significant potential across various research fields and industries. However, the lack of standardized methods for signal and noise estimation and reduction hinders its full potential. This paper introduces a methodology to significantly reduce noise in THz-TDS time traces, providing a reliable and less biased estimation of the signal. The method results in an improved signal-to-noise ratio, enabling the utilization of the full dynamic range of such setups. Additionally, we investigate the estimation of the covariance matrix to quantify the uncertainties associated with the signal estimator. This matrix is essential for extracting accurate material parameters by normalizing the error function in the fitting process. Our approach addresses practical scenarios where the number of repeated measurements is limited compared to the sampling time axis length. We envision this work as the initial step toward standardizing THz-TDS data processing. We believe it will foster collaboration between the THz and signal processing communities, leading to the development of more sophisticated methods to tackle new challenges introduced by novel setups based on optoelectronic devices and dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ultra-narrow linewidth laser across the C-band using polarization-controlled dual-cavity feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard method to reduce the linewidth of semiconductor lasers involves the use of external optical feedback (EOF). However, feedback powers less than 1 % usually trigger coherence collapse (CC), leading to chaotic laser dynamics and linewidth broadening. This paper explores a method to mitigate CC through precise tuning of the feedback polarization depending on the feedback power. We report a semiconductor laser with a sub-kHz linewidth, achieved via EOF. The laser features a U-shaped cavity with two sampled grating distributed Bragg reflectors (SG-DBRs), enabling broad tunability across a 42 nm wavelength range (1513-1555 nm). By injecting optical feedback into both sides of the laser cavity via an external fiber-based cavity, we reduce the linewidth by more than three orders of magnitude, from MHz to sub-kHz across the laser's tuning range. Our approach achieves significant linewidth reduction while maintaining coherence at high feedback levels, marking an improvement over prior studies where CC limited performance. These results pave the way for ultra-narrow linewidth diode lasers with wide tunability, which would benefit fields like coherent optical communications and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Leveraging reconfigurable micro-resonator soliton crystals for Intensity-Modulated Direct Detection Data Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perennial demand for highly efficient short-haul communications is evidenced by a sustained explosion of growth in data center infrastructure that is predicted to continue for the foreseeable future. In these relatively compact networks, cost-sensitivity is of particular importance, which limits options to direct detection schemes that are more cost efficient than their coherent counterparts. Since their initial demonstration, multi-soliton states in optical microresonators have been observed to manifest in self-organised ensembles where soliton pulses are equally spaced around the resonators. In the spectral domain, these states, dubbed soliton crystals (SCs), result in significant enhancements to individual comb lines depending on the crystal state, making them well suited towards intensity-modulated direct detection (IMDD) schemes. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate adiabatic, deterministic access to lower-order soliton crystal states using an auxiliary-assisted cavity pumping method, attaining up to 19.6 dB enhancement of the comb lines in the 7-SC configuration compared to the single-soliton state. Seven comb lines of each 46 Gbaud/s pulse amplitude modulation 4 (PAM4) is transmitted over 4km of fiber in comb lines across the C-band with bit-error-rates (BER) as low as 5E-5. Our demonstration shows the promising way of using soliton crystal states as future integrated sources for highly stable Terabaud/s datacenter communications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic van der Waals Crystal with High Refractive Index and Transparency for UV-Visible Range Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their record high refractive index and giant optical anisotropy, van der Waals (vdW) materials have accelerated the development of nanophotonics. However, traditional high refractive index materials, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), still dominate in the most important visible range. This is due to the current lack of transparent vdW materials across the entire visible spectrum. In this context, we propose that germanium disulfide (GeS2) could offer a significant breakthrough. With its high refractive index, negligible losses, and biaxial optical anisotropy across the whole visible range, GeS2 has the potential to complement TiO2 and close the application gap of vdW materials in the visible spectrum. The addition of GeS2 could have a profound impact on the design of van der Waals nanophotonic circuits for any operation wavelength from ultraviolet to infrared, emphasizing the significance of the potential impact of GeS2 on the field of nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband tunable difference frequency generation in standardized thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is a promising platform for nonlinear photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its strong light confinement, high second-order nonlinearity, and flexible quasi-phase matching for three-wave mixing processes via periodic poling. Among the three-wave mixing processes of interest, difference frequency generation (DFG) can produce long wave infrared (IR) light from readily available near IR inputs. While broadband DFG is well studied for mid-IR frequencies, achieving broadband idler generation within the telecom window (near C-band) and the short-wave infrared (near 2 micron) is more challenging due to stringent dispersion profile requirements, especially when using standardized TFLN thicknesses. In this paper, we investigate various standard waveguide designs to pinpoint favorable conditions for broadband DFG operation covering several telecom bands. Our simulations identify viable designs with a possible 3-dB conversion efficiency bandwidth (CE-BW) of 300 nm and our measurements show idler generation from 1418 nm to 1740 nm, limited by our available sources, experimentally confirming our design approach. Furthermore, temperature tuning allows further shift of the idler towards the mid-IR, up to 1819 nm. We also achieve a stretched wavelength range of idler generation by leveraging the longitudinal variation of the waveguide in addition to poling. Finally, our numerical simulations show the possibility of extending the CE-BW up to 780 nm while focusing on waveguide cross-sections that are available for fabrication within a foundry. Our work provides a methodology that bridges the deviations between fabricated and designed cross-sections, paving a way for standardized broadband DFG building blocks.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging using a high-speed silicon photomultiplier array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed multiplex imaging of fluorescent probes is limited by a combination of spectral resolution, sensitivity, high cost and low light throughput of detectors, and filters. In this work, we present a hyperspectral detection system based on a silicon photomultiplier array that enables high-speed, high-light throughput hyperspectral imaging at low cost. We demonstrate 16 spectral channel imaging at 50 MP/s (800M spectra per second) with a conventional two photon microscope combined with a generalized spectral unmixing model that enables extraction of spectrally overlapping fluorophores. We show that the high spectral resolution combined with high throughput enables the multiplexing of multiple contrast agents over large areas and the detection of subtle spectral shifts associated with molecular binding. Silicon photomultiplier arrays may be a promising method to extend multiplex fluorescence imaging in a variety of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Engineering dipole-dipole couplings for enhanced cooperative light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative optical effects are enabled and controlled by interactions between molecular dipoles, meaning that their mutual orientation is of paramount importance to, for example, superabsorbing light-harvesting antennas. Here we show how to move beyond the possibilities of simple geometric tailoring, demonstrating how a metallic sphere placed within a ring of parallel dipoles engineers an effective Hamiltonian that generates "guide-sliding" states within the ring system. This allows steady-state superabsorption in noisy room temperature environments, outperforming previous designs while being significantly simpler to implement.
  As exemplified by this showcase, our approach represents a powerful design paradigm for tailoring cooperative light-matter effects in molecular structures that extends beyond superabsorbing systems, to a huge array of quantum energy transport systems.</description>

      <title>Gain-Momentum Locking in a Chiral-Gain Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional optical materials are characterized by either a dissipative response, which results in polarization-independent absorption, or by a gain response that leads to wave amplification. In this study, we explore the potential of a peculiar class of materials with chiral-gain properties, where gain selectively amplifies waves of one polarization handedness, while dissipation suppresses the opposite handedness. We uncover a novel phenomenon, gain-momentum locking, at the boundary of these chiral-gain materials, where surface plasmons are uniquely amplified or attenuated based on their direction of propagation. This effect, driven by the interplay between spin-momentum locking and polarization-sensitive non-Hermitian responses, enables precise control over unidirectional wave propagation. Our findings open the door to photonic devices with unprecedented capabilities, such as lossless unidirectional edge-wave propagation and the generation of light with intrinsic orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the master equation for interacting quantized fields at finite temperature decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Markovian dynamics of a quantum system involving the interaction of two quantized fields at finite temperature decay. Utilizing superoperator techniques and applying two non-unitary transformations, we reformulate the Lindblad master equation into a von Neumann-like equation with an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Furthermore, an additional non-unitary transformation is employed to diagonalize this Hamiltonian, enabling us to derive an exact solution to the Lindblad master equation. This method provides a framework to calculate the evolution of any initial state in a fully quantum regime. As a specific example, we present the photon coincidence rates for two indistinguishable photons initially interacting within a cavity.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design of multicolor scintillators for enhanced energy resolution in X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillators have been widely used in X-ray imaging due to their ability to convert high-energy radiation into visible light, making them essential for applications such as medical imaging and high-energy physics. Recent advances in the artificial structuring of scintillators offer new opportunities for improving the energy resolution of scintillator-based X-ray detectors. Here, we present a three-bin energy-resolved X-ray imaging framework based on a three-layer multicolor scintillator used in conjunction with a physics-aware image postprocessing algorithm. The multicolor scintillator is able to preserve X-ray energy information through the combination of emission wavelength multiplexing and energy-dependent isolation of X-ray absorption in specific layers. The dominant emission color and the radius of the spot measured by the detector are used to infer the incident X-ray energy based on prior knowledge of the energy-dependent absorption profiles of the scintillator stack. Through ab initio Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our approach can achieve an energy reconstruction accuracy of 49.7%, which is only 2% below the maximum accuracy achievable with realistic scintillators. We apply our framework to medical phantom imaging simulations where we demonstrate that it can effectively differentiate iodine and gadolinium-based contrast agents from bone, muscle, and soft tissue.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network technique for online tracking of the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure liquids, liquid mixtures and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used convolutional neural network in a classification task to track the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol water polystyrene microparticles suspension, dipropylene glycol water mixture and dipropylene glycol water silica nanoparticles suspension. We discretized a wider radii range into short radii segments, labeled them with class numbers and generated theoretically light scattering patterns from Mie theory. Then the network was trained on the theoretical images and used to classify unlabeled experimentally recorded Mie scattering patterns from the evaporating microdroplets. A plot of the class average radii versus the camera s time step revealed the profile of the entire droplet radius evolution. We were able to work with approximately 1500 classes and showed that the technique has the potential to distinguish droplet size difference of 5 nm. We expect it to be applicable for online or real time tracking of droplet evaporation.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Feedforward of a Photonic Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulation conditioned on measurements on entangled photonic quantum states is a cornerstone technology of optical quantum information processing. Performing this task with low latency requires combining single-photon-level detectors with both electronic logic processing and optical modulation in close proximity. In the technologically relevant telecom wavelength band, detection of photonic quantum states is best performed with high-efficiency, low-noise, and high-speed detectors based on the photon-induced breakdown of superconductivity. Therefore, using these devices for feedforward requires mutual compatibility of all components under cryogenic conditions. Here, we demonstrate low-latency feedforward using a quasi-photon-number-resolved measurement on a quantum light source. Specifically, we use a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, amplifier, logic, and an integrated electro-optic modulator in situ below 4K. We modulate the signal mode of a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, conditional on a photon-number measurement of the idler mode, with a total latency of (23+/-3)ns. The photon-number discrimination actively manipulates the signal mode photon statistics, which is itself a central component in photonic quantum computing reliant on heralded single-photon sources. This represents an important benchmark for the fastest quantum photonic feedforward experiments comprising measurement, amplification, logic and modulation. This has direct applications in quantum computing, communication, and simulation protocols.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipole approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Extending the spectral operation of multimode and polarization-independent power splitters through subwavelength nanotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power splitters play a crucial role in virtually all photonic circuits, enabling precise control of on-chip signal distribution. However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by subwavelength grating metamaterials. The inclusion of the metamaterial structure circumvents the practical limitations of conventional Y-junction tips and realizes smooth modal transitions. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (&lt; 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultra-broad 700 nm bandwidth (1300-2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300-1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430-1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses &lt; 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to \pm 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic systems requiring high-performance distribution of optical signals.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Learned Neural Phase Functions for Basis-Free Point Spread Function Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that significantly outperforms existing pixel-wise optimization methods in phase function quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

Abstract: Quantum steganography is a powerful method for information security where communications between a sender and receiver are disguised as naturally occurring noise in a channel. We encoded the phase and amplitude of weak coherent laser states such that a third party monitoring the communications channel, measuring the flow of optical states through the channel, would see an amalgamation of states indistinguishable from thermal noise light. Using quantum state tomography, we experimentally reconstructed the density matrices for artificially engineered thermal states and spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier and verified a state fidelity F&gt;0.98 when compared with theoretical thermal states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>
