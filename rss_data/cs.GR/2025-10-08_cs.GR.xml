      <title>Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates). We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

      <title>Submillimeter-Accurate 3D Lumbar Spine Reconstruction from Biplanar X-Ray Images: Incorporating a Multi-Task Network and Landmark-Weighted Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To meet the clinical demand for accurate 3D lumbar spine assessment in a weight-bearing position, this study presents a novel, fully automatic framework for high-precision 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-ray images, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The core of this method involves a novel multi-task deep learning network that simultaneously performs lumbar decomposition and landmark detection on the original biplanar radiographs. The decomposition effectively eliminates interference from surrounding tissues, simplifying subsequent image registration, while the landmark detection provides an initial pose estimation for the Statistical Shape Model (SSM), enhancing the efficiency and robustness of the registration process. Building on this, we introduce a landmark-weighted 2D-3D registration strategy. By assigning higher weights to complex posterior structures like the transverse and spinous processes during optimization, this strategy significantly enhances the reconstruction accuracy of the posterior arch. Our method was validated against a gold standard derived from registering CT segmentations to the biplanar X-rays. It sets a new benchmark by achieving sub-millimeter accuracy and completes the full reconstruction and measurement workflow in under 20 seconds, establishing a state-of-the-art combination of precision and speed. This fast and low-dose pipeline provides a powerful automated tool for diagnosing lumbar conditions such as spondylolisthesis and scoliosis in their functional, weight-bearing state.</description>

      <title>SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds using Neural Variational Heat Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</description>

      <title>HiMat: DiT-based Ultra-High Resolution SVBRDF Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating ultra-high-resolution spatially varying bidirectional reflectance functions (SVBRDFs) is critical for photorealistic 3D content creation, to faithfully represent fine-scale surface details required for close-up rendering. However, achieving 4K generation faces two key challenges: (1) the need to synthesize multiple reflectance maps at full resolution, which multiplies the pixel budget and imposes prohibitive memory and computational cost, and (2) the requirement to maintain strong pixel-level alignment across maps at 4K, which is particularly difficult when adapting pretrained models designed for the RGB image domain. We introduce HiMat, a diffusion-based framework tailored for efficient and diverse 4K SVBRDF generation. To address the first challenge, HiMat performs generation in a high-compression latent space via DC-AE, and employs a pretrained diffusion transformer with linear attention to improve per-map efficiency. To address the second challenge, we propose CrossStitch, a lightweight convolutional module that enforces cross-map consistency without incurring the cost of global attention. Our experiments show that HiMat achieves high-fidelity 4K SVBRDF generation with superior efficiency, structural consistency, and diversity compared to prior methods. Beyond materials, our framework also generalizes to related applications such as intrinsic decomposition.</description>
