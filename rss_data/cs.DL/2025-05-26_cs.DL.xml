      <title>Clustering scientific publications: lessons learned through experiments with a real citation network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering scientific publications can reveal underlying research structures within bibliographic databases. Graph-based clustering methods, such as spectral, Louvain, and Leiden algorithms, are frequently utilized due to their capacity to effectively model citation networks. However, their performance may degrade when applied to real-world data. This study evaluates the performance of these clustering algorithms on a citation graph comprising approx. 700,000 papers and 4.6 million citations extracted from Web of Science. The results show that while scalable methods like Louvain and Leiden perform efficiently, their default settings often yield poor partitioning. Meaningful outcomes require careful parameter tuning, especially for large networks with uneven structures, including a dense core and loosely connected papers. These findings highlight practical lessons about the challenges of large-scale data, method selection and tuning based on specific structures of bibliometric clustering tasks.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Politicizing science funding undermines public trust in science, academic freedom, and the unbiased generation of knowledge"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a commentary published in mid-2024 (to which the present work is a direct response), a number of scientists argue that U.S. funding agencies have "politicized" the process by which grants are awarded, in service of diversifying the scientific workforce. The commentary in question, however, makes numerous unfounded assertions while recycling citations to a fusillade of opinion essays written by the same cabal of authors, in an effort to resemble a work of serious scholarship. Basic fact-checking is provided here, demonstrating numerous claims that are unsupported by the source material and readily debunked. The present work also serves to document the reality of inclusion and diversity plans for scientific grant proposals to U.S. funding agencies, as they existed at the end of 2024. It is intended as a bulwark against retroactive false narratives, as the U.S. moves into a period of intense antagonism towards diversity, equity, and inclusion activities.</description>

      <title>BAGELS: Benchmarking the Automated Generation and Extraction of Limitations from Scholarly Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific research, limitations refer to the shortcomings, constraints, or weaknesses within a study. Transparent reporting of such limitations can enhance the quality and reproducibility of research and improve public trust in science. However, authors often a) underreport them in the paper text and b) use hedging strategies to satisfy editorial requirements at the cost of readers' clarity and confidence. This underreporting behavior, along with an explosion in the number of publications, has created a pressing need to automatically extract or generate such limitations from scholarly papers. In this direction, we present a complete architecture for the computational analysis of research limitations. Specifically, we create a dataset of limitations in ACL, NeurIPS, and PeerJ papers by extracting them from papers' text and integrating them with external reviews; we propose methods to automatically generate them using a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique; we create a fine-grained evaluation framework for generated limitations; and we provide a meta-evaluation for the proposed evaluation techniques.</description>

      <title>A Domain Ontology for Modeling the Book of Purification in Islam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to address a gap in major Islamic topics by developing an ontology for the Book of Purification in Islam. Many authoritative Islamic texts begin with the Book of Purification, as it is essential for performing prayer (the second pillar of Islam after Shahadah, the profession of faith) and other religious duties such as Umrah and Hajj.
  The ontology development strategy followed six key steps: (1) domain identification, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) conceptualization, (4) classification, (5) integration and implementation, and (6) ontology generation. This paper includes examples of the constructed tables and classifications.
  The focus is on the design and analysis phases, as technical implementation is beyond the scope of this study. However, an initial implementation is provided to illustrate the steps of the proposed strategy.
  The developed ontology ensures reusability by formally defining and encoding the key concepts, attributes, and relationships related to the Book of Purification. This structured representation is intended to support knowledge sharing and reuse.</description>

      <title>SCIRGC: Multi-Granularity Citation Recommendation and Citation Sentence Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for interdisciplinary researchers.</description>

      <title>Language Models Surface the Unwritten Code of Science and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique. We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted responsible AI.</description>

      <title>Paper Copilot Position: The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Community Should Adopt a More Transparent and Regulated Peer Review Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Architectural Vulnerability and Reliability Challenges in AI Text Annotation: A Survey-Inspired Framework with Independent Probability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models, despite their power, have a fundamental architectural vulnerability stemming from their causal transformer design -- order sensitivity. This architectural constraint may distorts classification outcomes when prompt elements like label options are reordered, revealing a theoretical gap between accuracy metrics and true model reliability. The paper conceptualizes this vulnerability through the lens of survey methodology, where respondent biases parallel LLM positional dependencies. Empirical evidence using the F1000 biomedical dataset across three scales of LLaMA3.1 models (8B, 70B, 405B) demonstrates that these architectural constraints produce inconsistent annotations under controlled perturbations. The paper advances a practical solution for social science - Independent Probability Assessment - which decouples label evaluation to circumvent positional bias inherent in sequential processing. This approach yields an information-theoretic reliability measure (R-score) that quantifies annotation robustness at the case level. The findings establish that architectural vulnerabilities in causal transformers require methodological innovations beyond accuracy metrics to ensure valid social science inference, as demonstrated through downstream regression analyses where order-sensitive annotations significantly alter substantive conclusions about scientific impact.</description>
