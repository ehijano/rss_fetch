      <title>The boundedness of rough generalized commutators with Lipschitz functions on homogeneous variable exponent Herz type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of science, many nonlinear problems have emerged. At this time, the classical function space has certain restrictions. For example, it has lost its effectiveness for nonlinear problems under nonstandard growth conditions. In the process of studying such nonlinear problems, scholars are paying more and more attention to the transition from classical function space to variable exponent function space. Also, there is a big difference between variable exponent space and classical function space, mainly because variable exponent function space has lost translation invariance. This difference leads to many properties that hold in classical space no longer hold in variable exponent space. It is important to emphasize that variable exponent function spaces are a fundamental building block in harmonic analysis. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of function spaces equipped with variable exponents, leading to the development of a new framework known as variable exponent analysis. These spaces provide a powerful tool for analyzing functions with variable growth or decay rates and have found applications in various areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations, harmonic analysis and image processing. One can better understand the heterogeneity and complexity inherent in many real world phenomena by taking into consideration the theory of variable exponent function spaces. Thus, by using certain properties of Lipschitz functions and variable exponents, in this article, we establish the boundedness of a class of rough generalized commutators with Lipschitz functions on homogeneous variable exponent Herz and Herz-Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>Global Hypoellipticity for Systems in Time-Periodic Gelfand-Shilov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global hypoellipticity of a class of overdetermined systems with coefficients depending both on time and space variables in the setting of time-periodic Gelfand-Shilov spaces. Our main result provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the global hypoellipticity of this class of systems, stated in terms of Diophantine-type estimates and sign-changing behavior of the imaginary parts of the coefficients. Through a reduction to a normal form and detailed construction of singular solutions, we fully characterize when the system fails to be globally hypoelliptic.</description>

      <title>The Gierer-Meinhardt system in the entire space with non-local proliferation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel stationary Gierer-Meinhardt system incorporating non-local proliferation rates, defined as follows: $$ \begin{cases} \displaystyle -\Delta u+\lambda u=\frac{J*u^p}{v^q}+\rho(x) &amp;\quad\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^N\, , N\geq 1,\\[0.1in] \displaystyle -\Delta v+\mu v=\frac{J*u^m}{v^s} &amp;\quad\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^N.\\[0.1in] \end{cases} $$ This system emerges in various contexts, such as biological morphogenesis, where two interacting chemicals, identified as an activator and an inhibitor, are described, and in ecological systems modelling the interaction between two species, classified as specialists and generalists. The non-local interspecies interactions are represented by the terms $J*u^p, J*u^m$ where the $*$-symbol denotes the convolution operation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a kernel $J\in C^1(\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\{0\})$.
  In the system, we assume that $0&lt;\rho\in C^{0, \gamma}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $\gamma\in (0,1)$, while the parameters satisfy $\lambda, \mu, q,m,s&gt;0$ and $p&gt;1$. Under various integrability conditions on the kernel $J$, we establish the existence and non-existence of classical positive solutions in the function space $C^{2, \delta}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^N).$ These results further highlight the influence of the non-local terms, particularly the proliferation rates, in the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear equations near smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce the problem of proving decay estimates for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear PDEs to proving analogous estimates for solutions of one-dimensional ordinary differential inequalities. Our machinery allow the ellipticity to vanish near the boundary and permits general, possibly unbounded, lower-order terms. A key consequence is the derivation of boundary Harnack inequalities for a broad class of fully nonlinear, nonhomogeneous equations near $C^{1,1}$-boundaries.
  In combination with $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimates, we also obtain that quotients of positive vanishing solutions are H\"older continuous near $C^{1,1}$-boundaries.This result applies to a wide family of fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic PDEs; and for $p(x)$-harmonic functions and planar $\infty$-harmonic functions near locally flat boundaries. We end by deriving some Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of-type corollaries in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>An Iterative PDE Based Illumination Restoration Scheme for Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel iterative scheme for restoring uneven illumination in grayscale images. Our approach solves, at each global iteration, a nonlinear elliptic equation for an auxiliary field $u$ and then updates the illumination via an explicit time-marching step driven by the logarithmic potential of $u$. We establish existence and uniqueness of the discrete subproblems, analyze convergence of the fixed point iteration, and demonstrate performance on standard test images, reporting PSNR and SSIM gains over classical methods. Future work will address color coupling and GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Quantitative quasi-invariance of Gaussian measures below the energy level for the 1D generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and application to global well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger equation on the one dimensional torus with a general odd-power nonlinearity $p \geq 5$, which is known to be globally well-posed in the Sobolev space $H^\sigma(\mathbb{T})$, for every $\sigma \geq 1$, thanks to the conservation and finiteness of the energy. For regularities $\sigma &lt; 1$, where this energy is infinite, we explore a globalization argument adapted to random initial data distributed according to the Gaussian measures $\mu_s$, with covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^s$, for $s$ in a range $(s_p,\frac{3}{2}]$. We combine a deterministic local Cauchy theory with the quasi-invariance of Gaussian measures $\mu_s$, with additional $L^q$-bounds on the Radon-Nikodym derivatives, to prove that the Gaussian initial data generate almost surely global solutions. These $L^q$-bounds are obtained with respect to Gaussian measures accompanied by a cutoff on a renormalization of the energy; the main tools to prove them are the Bou\'e-Dupuis variational formula and a Poincar\'e-Dulac normal form reduction. This approach is similar in spirit to Bourgain's invariant argument and to a recent work by Forlano-Tolomeo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work contributes to the theory of nth level fractional derivative, where $n$ is a positive integer. An equivalent representation of 2nd level fractional derivative in terms of Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative is presented. We generalized our result and provide representation of nth level fractional derivative. As an application, we solve an inverse problem defined for a diffusion equation involving 2nd level fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>A degree-counting formula for a Keller-Segel equation on a surface with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Keller-Segel equation on a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Sigma$: \[
  -\Delta_g u = \rho\Big(\frac{V e^u}{\int_{\Sigma} V e^u \mathrm{d} v_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\Big) \text{ in } {\Sigma}, \quad \text{ with }
  \partial_{\nu_g} u = 0 \text{ on } \partial \Sigma, \]
  where $V$ is a smooth positive function on $\Sigma$ and $\rho &gt; 0$ is a parameter.
  We perform a refined blow-up analysis of bubbling solutions and establish sharper a priori estimates around their concentration points. We then compute the Morse index of these solutions and use it to derive a counting formula for the Leray-Schauder degree in the non-resonant case (i.e., $\rho \notin 4 \pi \mathbb{N}$). Our approach follows the strategy proposed by C.-S. Lin and C.-C. Chen [15,16] for mean field equation on closed surfaces and employs techniques from Bahri's critical points at infinity [8].</description>

      <title>Sharp inequalities and asymptotics for polyharmonic eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study eigenvalues of general scalar Dirichlet polyharmonic problems in domains in $\mathbb R^{d}$. We first prove a number of inequalities satisfied by the eigenvalues on general domains, depending on the relations between the orders of the operators involved. We then obtain several estimates for these eigenvalues, yielding their growth as a function of these orders. For the problem in the ball we derive the general form of eigenfunctions together with the equations satisfied by the corresponding eigenvalues, and obtain several bounds for the first eigenvalue. In the case of the polyharmonic operator of order $2m$ we derive precise bounds yielding the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion for the first normalised eigenvalue as $m$ grows to infinity. These results allow us to obtain the order of growth for the $k^{\rm th}$ polyharmonic eigenvalue on general domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-spike positive solutions to the Lane-Emden problem in any bounded smooth planar domain and compute their Morse index, extending to the dimension $N=2$ classical theorems due to Bahri-Li-Rey (1995) and Rey (1999) when $N\geq 4$ and $N=3$, respectively. Furthermore, by deeply investigating their concentration behavior, we also derive the total topological degree. The Morse index and the degree counting formula yield a new local uniqueness result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build infinitely many geometrically distinct non-radial sign-changing solutions for the Hamiltonian-type elliptic systems $$ -\Delta u =|v|^{p-1}v\ \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N,\ -\Delta v =|u|^{q-1}u\ \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N,$$ where the exponents $(p,q)$ satisfy $p,q&gt;1$ and belong to the critical hyperbola $$\frac1{p+1}+\frac1{q+1} =\frac {N-2}N.$$ To establish this result, we introduce several new ideas and strategies that are both robust and potentially applicable to other critical problems lacking the Kelvin invariance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the long-time dynamics of semilinear wave equation subject to dissipative boundary condition. To do so, we first analyze the set of equilibria, and show it could contain infinitely many elements. Second, we show that, for some nonlinear interior sources, the wave equations have solutions that do not stabilize to any single function, while they approach a continuum of such functions. Finally, if the interior source is a {\L}ojasiewicz-type function, the solution of the wave equation converges to an equilibrium at a rate that depends on the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent, although the set of equilibria is infinite.</description>

      <title>Melting and freezing rates of the radial interior Stefan problem in two dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the interior Stefan problem under radial symmetry in two dimension. A water ball surrounded by ice undergoes melting or freezing. We construct a discrete family of global-in-time solutions, both melting and freezing scenarios. The evolution of the free boundary, represented by the radius of the water ball, $\lambda(t)$ exhibits exponential convergence to a limiting radius value $\lambda_\infty &gt; 0$, characterized by the asymptotic expression \[ \lambda(t) = \lambda_\infty + (1 - \lambda_\infty)\, e^{-\frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_\infty^2} t + o_{t \to \infty}(1)}, \] where $\lambda_k$ stands for the $k$-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the unit disk for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Our approach draws inspiration from the research conducted by Had\v{z}i\'c and Rapha\"el [24] concerning the exterior radial Stefan problem, which involves an ice ball is surrounded by water. In contrast, the bounded geometry in our setting leads to scenario results in a non-degenerate spectrum, leading to distinctly different long-term behavior. These solutions for each $k$ remain stable under perturbations of co-dimension $k - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a transfer operator where two interacting cells carrying non-negative traits transfer a random fraction of their trait to each other. These transfers can lead to population having singular distributions in trait. We extend the definition of the transfer operator to non-negative measures with a finite second moment, and we discuss the regularity of the fixed distributions of that transfer operator. Finally, we consider a dynamic transfer model where an initial population distribution is affected by a transfer operator: we prove the existence and uniqueness of mild measure-valued solutions for that Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity for uniformly convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide an optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity regime for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations with uniformly convex Hamiltonian. We prove that for a globally Lipschitz-continuous and semiconcave terminal condition the rate is of order O($\epsilon$log$\epsilon$), and we provide an example to show that this rate cannot be sharpened. This improves on the previously known rate of convergence O($\sqrt$$\epsilon$), which was widely believed to be optimal. Our proof combines techniques involving regularisation by sup-convolution with entropy estimates for the flow of a suitable version of the adjoint linearized equation. The key technical point is an integrated estimate of the Laplacian of the solution against this flow.

      <title>Stochastic parabolic equations in Musielak-Orlicz spaces with discontinuous in time N-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic parabolic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, multiplicative stochastic noise, and a monotone parabolic operator A. The growth and coercivity of A is controlled by a general N-function M, which depends on time, and spatial variable, but we do not assume any regularity with respect to the former. We show the existence of weak solutions to such system. As auxiliary result, we also provide the proof for the It\^{o}'s formula in Orlicz spaces. This general result applies to the ones studied in the literature, such as p(t, x)-Laplacian and double phase problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of a large solution to a semilinear problem in a bounded open $C^{1,1}$ set for a class of nonlocal operators obtained by an appropriate subordination of the Laplacian. These operators are classical generalisations of the fractional Laplacian. The existence result is shown under a nonlocal version of the Keller-Osserman condition, stated in terms of the subordinator and the source term $f$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a characterization of the time-periodic Gelfand-Shilov spaces, as introduced by F. de \'Avila Silva and M. Cappiello [J. Funct. Anal., 282(9):29, 2022], through the asymptotic behaviour of both the Euclidean and periodic partial Fourier transforms of their elements. As an application, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for global regularity -- within this framework -- for a broad class of constant-coefficient differential operators, as well as for first-order tube-type operators.</description>

      <title>Formal derivation of an isentropic two-phase flow model from the multi-species Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the multi-species Boltzmann equation for a gas mixture, we propose the formal derivation of the isentropic two-phase flow model introduced in [Romenski, E., and Toro, E. F., Comput. Fluid Dyn. J., 13 (2004)]. We examine the asymptotic limit as the Knudsen numbers approach zero, in a regime characterized by resonant intra-species collisions, where interactions between particles of the same species dominate. This specific regime leads to a multi-velocity and multi-pressure hydrodynamic model, enabling the explicit computation of the coefficients for the two-phase macroscopic model. Our derivation also accounts for the inclusion of the evolution of the volume fraction, which is a key variable in many macroscopic multiphase models</description>

Abstract: We introduce a kinetic model that couples the movement of a population of individuals with the dynamics of a pathogen in the same population. The model is formally shown to generalize the well-known compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in appropriate spaces for particular instances of the model. We finish with some examples, and discuss possible applications of this modeling approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide some uniqueness results for the (multi-)coefficient identification problem of reconstructing the spatially varying spin density as well as the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times and the local field inhomogeneity in the Bloch-Torrey equation, as relevant in magnetic resonance imaging MRI. To this end, we follow two approaches: (a) Relying on sampling of the k-space and (approximately) explicit reconstruction formulas in the simplified (Bloch) ODE setting, along with perturbation estimates; (b) Relying on infinite speed of propagation due to diffusion. The results on well-posendess and Lipschitz continuous differentiability of the coefficient-to-state map derived for this purpose, are expected to be useful also in the convergence analysis of reconstruction schemes as well in mathematical optimization of the experimental design in MRI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper our main goal is to study the evolution problem associated with the Laplacian operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a regular tree. First, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions when the initial condition is compatible with the boundary condition. Next, we deal with the asymptotic behavior of the solutions and we prove that they decay to zero exponentially fast. This decay rate is governed by the associated first eigenvalue that we also study here.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of a slowly-varying time-dependent parameter on invasion fronts for which an unstable homogeneous equilibrium is invaded by either another homogeneous state or a spatially periodic state. We first explain and motivate our approach by studying asymptotically constant invasion fronts in a scalar FKPP equation with time-dependent parameter which controls the stability of the trivial state. Following recent works in the area, we use a linearized analysis to derive formal predictions for front position and leading-edge spatial decay. We then use a comparison principle approach to establish a rigorous spreading result in the case of an unbounded temporal parameter. We then consider patterned-invasion in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic bifurcation parameter, a prototype for slow passage through a spatio-temporal Hopf instability. Linearized analysis once again gives front position and decay asymptotics, but also the selected spatial wavenumber at the leading edge. We then use a Burger's modulation analysis to predict the slowly-varying wavenumber in the wake of the front. Finally, in both equations, we used the recently developed concept of a space-time memory curve to characterize delayed invasion in the case where the parameter is initially stable before a subsequent slow passage through instability and invasion. We also provide preliminary results studying invasion in other prototypical pattern formation models modified with a dynamic parameter, as well as numerical results for delayed transition between pushed and pulled fronts in Nagumo's equation with dynamic parameter.</description>

Abstract: We prove that area-minimizing hypersurfaces are generically smooth in ambient dimension $11$ in the context of the Plateau problem and of area minimization in integral homology. For higher ambient dimensions, $n+1 \geq 12$, we prove in the same two contexts that area-minimizing hypersurfaces have at most an $n-10-\epsilon_n$ dimensional singular set after an arbitrarily $C^\infty$-small perturbation of the Plateau boundary or the ambient Riemannian metric, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work "Dealing with moment measures via entropy and optimal transport", Santambrogio provided an optimal transport approach to study existence of solutions for the moment measure equation, that is: given $\mu$, find $u$ such that $ (\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u}=\mu$. In particular he proves that $u$ satisfies the previous equation if and only if $e^{-u}$ is the minimizer of an entropy and a transport cost. Here we study a modified minimization problem, in which we add a strongly convex regularization depending on a positive $\alpha$ and we link its solutions to a modified moment measure equation $(\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u-\frac{\alpha}{2} \|x\|^2}= \mu$. Exploiting the regularization term, we study the stability of the minimizers.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Adjoint-Optimized Neural PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Flat Chain Conjecture and non-regularity of the prescribed Jacobian equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Flat Chain Conjecture in Lang's formulation (that is, without requiring finite mass of the underlying currents) fails for metric $k$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whenever $d\geq 2$ and $k\in\{1, \dots, d\}$. In all other cases, it holds. We first connect the conjecture to a regularity statement concerning the prescribed Jacobian equation near $L^\infty$. We then show that the equation does not have the required regularity. For a Lipschitz vector field $\pi$, its derivative $\mathrm{D}\pi$ exists a.e. and is identified with a matrix. Our non-regularity results for the prescribed Jacobian equation quantify how "small" the set
  \begin{equation*}

      <title>Mixing for acoustic wave motion with boundary random force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns about the large time behavior of acoustic wave motion driven by a random force acting through the boundary. We begin with an abstract result showing the interconnection between the regularity of Markov semigroup generated by a stochastic evolution equation and the observability property of the corresponding adjoint system. This result is then applied to study the mixing for acoustic wave system with a boundary random perturbation of the white noise type. We shall show there exists a unique invariant measure for the stochastic wave system, and the law of the solution to the system converges to this invariant measure weakly.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of 2D Navier-Stokes with Dirichlet boundary fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and interior regularity for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a fractional noise acting as an inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary condition. The model describes a vertical slice of the ocean with a relative motion between the two surfaces and can be thought of as a stochastic variant of the Couette flow. The relative motion of the surfaces is modeled by a Gaussian noise which is coloured in space and fractional in time with Hurst parameter greater than 3/4.</description>

      <title>Global existence for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for wave equations with scale-invariant time-dependent damping and nonlinear time-derivative terms, modeled as $$\partial_{t}^2u- \Delta u +\frac{\mu}{1+t}\partial_tu= f(\partial_tu), \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n, t&gt;0,$$ where $f(\partial_tu)=|\partial_tu|^p $ or $|\partial_tu|^{p-1}\partial_tu$ with $p&gt;1$ and $\mu&gt;0$. We prove global existence of small data solutions in low dimensions $1\leq n\leq 3$ by using energy estimates in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Our primary contribution is an existence result for $p&gt;1+\frac2{\mu}$, in the one-dimensional case, when $\mu \le 2$, which in conjunction with prior blow-up results from \cite{Our2}, establish that the critical exponent for small data solutions in one dimension is $p_G(1,\mu)=1+\frac2{\mu}$, when $\mu \le 2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of the critical exponent range for the time-dependent damped wave equations with scale-invariant and time-derivative nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes and Euler equations in a bounded domain with non-characteristic boundary condition, and study the energy dissipation near the outflow boundary in the zero-viscosity limit. We show that in a general setting, the energy dissipation rate is proportional to $\bar U \bar V ^2$, where $\bar U$ is the strength of the suction and $\bar V$ is the tangential component of the difference between the Euler and the Navier-Stokes solutions on the outflow boundary. Moreover, we show that the enstrophy within a layer of order $\nu / \bar U$ is comparable with the total enstrophy. The rate of enstrophy production near the boundary is inversely proportional to $\nu$.</description>

Abstract: We show an abstract critical point theorem about existence of infinitely many critical orbits to strongly indefinite functionals with sign-changing nonlinear part defined on a dislocation space with a discrete group action. We apply the abstract result to a Schr\"odinger equation $$ -\Delta u + V(x) u = f(u) - \lambda g(u) $$ with $0$ in the spectral gap of the Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta + V(x)$, that appears in nonlinear optics, as well as to the equations with singular potentials arising from the study of cylindrically symmetric, electromagnetic waves to the system of Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution for the stochastic tamed Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising in biomathematics, consisting of a chemotaxis model with a cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by using the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators, and cut-off functions. This scheme enables the construction of sufficiently smooth approximate solutions and facilitates the effective application of the entropy-energy method. Then, based on a newly derived stochastic version of the entropy-energy inequality, we further establish some a priori higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method, allow us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shallow water system with a bed jump describes a fluid flow over a dam, represented by a simple step function with the Riemann initial data is such that the vacuum is on the right-hand side. The main question is whether the fluid will stay on the left-hand side of the dam. After approximating the step function space derivative with a fixed shadow wave, solutions to that problem stay bounded. A proper connection between waves on both sides of the dam, and a unique solution afterward is found by using the maximal dissipation principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a broad class of nonlinear integro-differential equations with a kernel whose differentiability order is described by a general function $\phi$. This class includes not only the fractional $p$-Laplace equations, but also borderline cases when the fractional order approaches $1$. Under mild assumptions on $\phi$, we establish sharp Sobolev-Poincar\'e type inequalities for the associated Sobolev spaces, which are connected to a question raised by Brezis (Russian Math. Surveys 57:693--708, 2002). Using these inequalities, we prove H\"older regularity and Harnack inequalities for weak solutions to such nonlocal equations. All the estimates in our results remain stable as the associated nonlocal energy functional approaches its local counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with rapidly growing nonlinearities in the two-dimensional bounded strictly convex domains. In this paper, we prove the uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions. As a result, we show that there exists a solution curve having infinitely many bifurcation/turning points. These results are recently proved by the present author for supercritical nonlinearities when the domain is the unit ball via an ODE argument. Instead of the ODE argument, we apply a new method focusing on the interaction between the growth condition of the nonlinearities and the shape of the fundamental solution. As a result, we clarify the bifurcation structure for general convex domains.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,\\ \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0. \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove the lower semicontinuity of a Neohookean-type energy for a model of Nonlinear Elasticity that allows, for the first time, for $p&lt;n-1$. Our class of admissible deformations consists of weak limits of Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ homeomorphisms. We also introduce a model that allows for cavitations by studying weak limits of homeomorphisms that can open cavities at some points. In this model we add the measure of the created surface to the energy functional and for this functional we again prove lower semicontinuity.</description>

      <title>Wave-front tracking for a quasi-linear scalar conservation law with hysteresis II: the case of Preisach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the quasi-linear scalar conservation law \[u_t+\mathcal{F}(u)_t+u_x=0,\] where $\mathcal{F}$ is a specific hysteresis operator. Hysteresis models a rate-independent memory relationship between the input $u$ and its output, giving a non-local feature to the equation. In a previous work the authors studied the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the Play operator. In the present article, we extend the analysis to the case of Preisach operator, which is probably the most versatile mathematical model to describe hysteresis in the applications, especially for the presence of some kind of internal variables. This fact has required a new analysis of the equation. Starting from the Riemann problem, we address the so-called wave-front tracking method for a solution to the Cauchy problem with bounded variation initial data. An entropy-like condition is also exploited for uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of zeroes of trigonometric polynomials under repeated differentiation. We show that if the zeroes of a real-rooted, degree $d$ trigonometric polynomial are distributed according to some probability measure $\nu$ in the large $d$ limit, then the zeroes of its $[2td]$-th derivative, where $t&gt;0$ is fixed, are distributed according to the free multiplicative convolution of $\nu$ and the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$. In the simplest special case, our result states that the zeroes of the $[2td]$-th derivative of the trigonometric polynomial $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^{2d}$ (which can be thought of as the trigonometric analogue of the Laguerre polynomials) are distributed according to the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$, in the large $d$ limit. The latter distribution is defined in terms of the function $\zeta=\zeta_t(\theta)$ which solves the implicit equation $\zeta - t \tan \zeta = \theta$ and satisfies $$ \zeta_t(\theta)= \theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta +\ldots))), \qquad \mathrm{Im}\, \theta &gt;0, \;\; t&gt;0. $$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study translating solitons for the mean curvature flow, $\Sigma^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ which are contained in slabs, and are of finite genus and finite entropy. As a first consequence of our results, we can enumerate connected components of slices to define asymptotic invariants $\omega^\pm(\Sigma)\in\mathbb{N}$, which count the numbers of "wings''. Analyzing these, we give a method for computing the entropies $\lambda(\Sigma)$ via a simple formula involving the wing numbers, which in particular shows that for this class of solitons the entropy is quantized into integer steps. Finally, combining the concept of wing numbers with Morse theory for minimal surfaces, we prove the uniqueness theorem that if $\Sigma$ is a complete embedded simply connected translating soliton contained in a slab with entropy $\lambda(\Sigma)=3$ and containing a vertical line, then $\Sigma$ is one of the translating pitchforks of Hoffman-Mart\'in-White</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the heat kernel on a doubling Dirichlet metric measure space has a sub-Gaussian bound, we prove an asymptotically sharp spectral upper bound on the survival probability of the associated diffusion process. As a consequence, we can show that the supremum of the mean exit time over all starting points is finite if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is positive. Among several applications, we show that the spectral upper bound on the survival probability implies a bound for the Hot Spots constant for Riemannian manifolds. Our results apply to interesting geometric settings including sub-Riemannian manifolds and fractals.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for fractional polyharmonic Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Large deviations and free energy of Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3$-model in infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large deviations for focusing Gibbs measures by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the free energy in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we establish a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around the zero field, leading to a triviality result in the infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>
