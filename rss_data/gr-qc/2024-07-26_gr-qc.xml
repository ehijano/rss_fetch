      <title>Interacting Null Sources in Different Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce basic mathematical techniques, followed by an exploration of three distinct topics: the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model in 1+1-dimensional spacetime, the formation of astrophysical jets in Schwarzschild-like black holes, and collisions and confinement phenomena in the third-order Lovelock gravity.
  In the CGHS model, we investigate the collision of ghost fields within the dilaton background geometry, observing the formation and dissolution of wormholes by inserting and removing the ghost fields, respectively. This process mimics a cosmological-scale analogue of Feynman diagrams.
  Next, we study the non-zero expectation values of bumblebee fields due to Lorentz symmetry breaking. This alteration in the energy-momentum tensor necessitates the inclusion of a potential vacuum, resulting in a shift of the vacuum solution towards Schwarzchild-like black holes with a scaling factor $l$. This scaling factor facilitates discussions on the collision of null sources, leading to the formation of impulsive null shells and satisfying the type-D condition. When $l$ approaches zero, jet-like formations vanish, transforming the problem into one involving colliding gravitational waves, which is isometric to the Schwarzschild geometry. Moreover, our method can be applied to any resembling Schwarzschild-like metrics. We aim to enhance our model by incorporating additional physical factors such as extra polarizations or EM fields.
  Finally, our examination extends to the 4-dimensional third-order Lovelock gravity, observing that particles possess finite energy and be confined within the metric time interval extending from - to + infinity. Moreover, this finding does not admit flat rotation curves. Additionally, when collisions occur within the background of this metric, intriguingly, we observe impulsive Weyl curvatures along the null boundaries subsequent to the collision.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Highly Magnified Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing has empowered telescopes to discover astronomical objects that are otherwise out of reach without being highly magnified by foreground structures. While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly magnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this letter, we fill this gap and explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find that these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as smoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any electromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in some cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform signatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with current-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these highly magnified GWs and can use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the usual horizon.</description>

      <title>Spatial curvature in coincident gauge $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature for the symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity, giving the first presentation of their coincident gauge form. Our approach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs the coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then obtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved branch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches of connection in the covariant approach can be studied in this gauge-fixed formalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. Interestingly, we find that the flat and negative spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be seen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ theories, demonstrating a deeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the connection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency condition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing'' and "no boundary'' proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Fractional Scalar Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) metric and the Einstein scalar field system as an underlying gravitational model to construct fractional cosmological models has interesting implications in both classical and quantum regimes. Regarding the former, we just review the most fundamental approach to establishing an extended cosmological model. We demonstrate that employing new methodologies allows us to obtain exact solutions. Despite the corresponding standard models, we cannot use any arbitrary scalar potentials; instead, it is determined from solving three independent fractional field equations. This article concludes with an overview of a fractional quantum/semi-classical model that provides an inflationary scenario.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Rotating Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing modified Chaplygin fluid prescription for the dark energy, we construct slowly rotating isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars. The slow rotation is incorporated via general relativistic Hartle-Thorne formalism; whereas the anisotropy is introduced through Bowers-Liang prescription. We consider both the monopole and quadrupole deformations and present a complete analysis of rotating dark energy stars. By numerically solving the rotating stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we analyse and quantify various properties of dark energy stars such as mass ($M$), radius, mass deformation, angular momentum ($J$), moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment ($Q$), for three different equation of state parameters. We find that anisotropic slow rotation results in significant deformation of stellar mass and thereby affects other global properties studied. For the values of angular frequencies considered, the effect of anisotropy on the stellar structure is found to be more prominent than that due to rotation. The dimensionless quadrupole moment $QM/J^2$ measuring deviation from a Kerr metric black hole was obtained for anisotropic dark energy stars. We observe that dark energy stars with higher anisotropic strength tend to approach the Kerr solution more closely. We report that our results have considerable agreement with various astrophysical observational measurements.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild black-hole immersed in uniform electric or magnetic backgrounds in Entangled Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solution for a Schwarzschild black-hole immersed in an electric or magnetic background field within the framework of Entangled Relativity. Previous solutions in Entangled Relativity required black-holes to be charged for the matter field to be defined everywhere. This is because the theory precludes the existence of vacuum solutions, thereby satisfying Einstein's definition of Mach's Principle. The current black-hole solutions represent the first exact and neutral black-hole solutions of Entangled Relativity discovered to date. The Schwarzschild black-hole of General Relativity emerges as a limit of these solutions when the background field approaches zero, whereas the Melvin solution of General Relativity does not emerge as a limit when the black hole's size approaches zero. This finding suggests that astrophysical black-holes in Entangled Relativity are indistinguishable from those in General Relativity, given the generally weak interstellar density of matter fields.</description>

      <title>Differential Forms vs Geometric Algebra: The quest for the best geometric language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential forms is a highly geometric formalism for physics used from field theories to General Relativity (GR) which has been a great upgrade over vector calculus with the advantages of being coordinate-free and carrying a high degree of geometrical content.
  In recent years, Geometric Algebra appeared claiming to be a unifying language for physics and mathematics with a high level of geometrical content. Its strength is based on the unification of the inner and outer product into a single geometric operation, and its easy interpretation.
  Given their similarities, in this article we compare both formalisms side-by-side to narrow the gap between them in literature. We present a direct translation including differential identities, integration theorems and various algebraic identities.
  As an illustrative example, we present the case of classical electrodynamics in both formalism and finish with their description of GR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields which are favorite among the possible candidates for the dark energy usually have degenerate minima at $\pm \phi_{min}$. In the presented work, we discuss a two Higgs doublet model with the non-degenerate vacuum named inert uplifted double well type two-Higgs doublet model (UDW-2HDM) for the dark energy. It is shown that when the both Higgs doublets lie in their respective true minima then one Higgs doublet can cause the current accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Relativistic gravity in the inhomogeneous Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmology is built on a relativistic understanding of gravity, where the geometry of the Universe is dynamically determined by matter and energy. In the cosmological concordance model, gravity is described by General Relativity, and it is assumed that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. These fundamental principles should be tested. In this thesis, we explore the implications of breaking them.
  In order to understand possible modifications to gravity on cosmological scales, we extend the formalism of parameterised post-Newtonian cosmology, an approach for building cosmological tests of gravity that are consistent with tests on astrophysical scales. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to construct theory-independent equations for the cosmic expansion and its first-order perturbations. Then, we apply the framework to observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. We use these to place novel cosmological constraints on the evolution of the post-Newtonian parameters.
  We investigate the consequences of inhomogeneity and isotropy by developing a new approach to studying anisotropy in the Universe, wherein we consider how an anisotropic cosmology might emerge on large scales as a result of averaging over inhomogeneous structures, and demonstrate how the emergent model is affected by backreaction. We perform a detailed study of light propagation in a wide class of inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes, exploring the conditions under which the Hubble diagram can be accurately predicted by an anisotropic model constructed using explicit averaging, even in the presence of large inhomogeneities. We show that observables calculated in a suitable averaged description closely reproduce the true Hubble diagram on large scales, as long as the spacetime possesses a well-defined homogeneity scale.</description>

      <title>Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii can reach at these mass scales.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the general physical question whether spacetime singularities inside black holes exist, we investigate the problem in the context of an analogue system, a flowing laboratory liquid, for which the governing equations are at least in principle known to all relevant scales, and in all regions of the effective spacetime. We suggest to probe the physical phenomena taking place close to a Penrose-type singularity in the interior of a $2+1$D analogue black hole arising from a polytropic, inviscid, irrotational, and axisymmetric steady flow, and propose to this end an experimental setup in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study provides concrete evidence, for a well understood dynamical system, that the Einstein equations are not necessary for a singularity to form, demonstrating that Penrose-type spacetime singularities can potentially also exist in non-Einsteinian theories of gravity. Finally, we demonstrate how the singularity is physically avoided in our proposed laboratory setup, and that our analysis can be generalized to three-dimensional flows ($3+1$D analogues).</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity of hyperbolic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10454v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the holographic complexity of a family of hyperbolic black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system by applying the complexity=action (CA) conjecture. While people previously studied spherical black holes in the same system, we show that hyperbolic black holes have intriguing features. We confirm that the complexity expression mainly depends on the spacetime causal structure despite the rich thermodynamics. The nontrivial neutral limit that exists only for hyperbolic black holes enables us to analytically obtain the complexity growth rate during phase transitions. We find that the dilaton accelerates the growth rate of complexity, and the Lloyd bound can be violated. This is in contrast to the spherical case where the dilation slows the complexity growth rate down, and the Lloyd bound is always satisfied. As a special case, we study the holographic complexity growth rate of the neutral hairy black holes and find that the Lloyd bound is always violated.</description>

      <title>Big Galaxies and Big Black Holes: The Massive Ends of the Local Stellar and Black Hole Mass Functions and the Implications for Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14595v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by combining the GSMF at stellar masses $M_* \lesssim 10^{11.3} M_\odot$ from the census study of Leja et al. (2020) and the GSMF of massive galaxies at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ from the volume-limited MASSIVE galaxy survey. To obtain a robust estimate of $M_*$ for local massive galaxies, we use MASSIVE galaxies with $M_*$ measured from detailed dynamical modeling or stellar population synthesis modeling (incorporating a bottom-heavy initial mass function) with high-quality spatially-resolved spectroscopy. These two independent sets of $M_*$ agree to within ${\sim}7$%. Our new $z=0$ GSMF has a higher amplitude at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ than previous studies, alleviating prior concerns of a lack of mass growth in massive galaxies between $z\sim 1$ and 0. We derive a local black hole mass function (BHMF) from this GSMF and the scaling relation of SMBH and galaxy masses. The inferred abundance of local SMBHs above $\sim 10^{10}M_\odot$ is consistent with the number of currently known systems. The predicted amplitude of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background is also consistent with the levels reported by Pulsar Timing Array teams. Our $z = 0$ GSMF therefore leads to concordant results in the high-mass regime of the local galaxy and SMBH populations and the gravitational wave amplitude from merging SMBHs. An exception is our BHMF yields a $z=0$ SMBH mass density that is notably higher than the value estimated from quasars at higher redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of the ten-dimensional heterotic string theories appropriate for implementing the stringy replica method for the calculation of quantum entanglement entropy. A novel feature for the heterotic string is that the gauge symmetry must be broken by a Wilson line to ensure modular invariance. We completely classify the patterns of symmetry breaking. We show that the tachyonic contributions in all cases can be analytically continued, with a finite answer in the domain $0&lt;N \leq 1$, relevant for calculating entanglement entropy across the Rindler horizon. We discuss the physical implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Quintessential Cosmic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a dissipative quintessential cosmic inflation. For this purpose, we add a multiplicative dissipative term in the standard quintessence field Lagrangian. We consider the specific form of dissipation as the time integral including the Hubble parameter and an arbitrary function that describes the dissipative properties of the quintessential scalar field. Inflation parameters and observables are calculated under slow-roll approximations and a detailed calculation of the cosmological perturbations is performed in this setup. We consider different forms of potentials and calculate the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for a constant as well as variable dissipation function. To check the reliability of this model, a numerical analysis on the model parameters space is done in confrontation with recent observational data. By comparing the results with observational joint datasets at 68% and 95% confidence levels, we obtain some constraints on the model parameters space, specially the dissipation factor with e-folds numbers N = 55 and N = 60. As some specific results, we show that the power-law potential with a constant dissipation factor and N = 60 is mildly consistent with observational data in some restricted domains of the model parameter space with very small and negative dissipation factor and a negligible tensor-toscalar ratio. But this case with N = 55 is consistent with observation considerably. For power-law potential and variable dissipation factor as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$, the consistency with observation is also considerable with a reliable tensor-to-scalar ratio. The quadratic and quartic potentials with variable dissipation function as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$ are consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing data at the 68% and 95% levels of confidence for some intervals of the parameter n.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we constructed the specific solution to the second-order cosmological perturbation theory, around any Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background filled with dust matter and a positive cosmological constant. In this paper, we use the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) sample of galaxies from the Extragalactic Distance Database to constrain this metric tensor. We obtain an approximation to the local matter distribution and geometry. We numerically solve for null geodesics for randomly distributed mock sources and compare this model with the Lemaitre-Hubble constant inferred from the observations under the assumption of perfect isotropy and homogeneity. We conclude on effects of realistic inhomogeneities on the luminosity distance in the context of the Hubble tension and discuss limitations of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Irreducible decompositions of tensors via the Brauer algebra and applications to metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this thesis, we make use of representation theory of groups and algebras to perform an irreducible decomposition of tensors in the context of metric-affine gravity. In particular, we consider the action of the orthogonal group O(1, d$-1$) on the Riemann tensor associated with an affine connection defined on a d-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. This connection, with torsion and non-metricity, is the characteristic ingredient of metric-affine theories of gravity.
  In the second part of this thesis, we construct the projection operators used for the aforementioned decomposition. They are realized in terms of the symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$ and of the Brauer algebra B$_n$(d) which are related respectively to the action of GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$)) and to the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) (and its real form O(1 , d$-1$)) on tensors via the Schur-Weyl duality. First of all, we give an alternative approach to the known formulas for the central idempotents of $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{S}_n$. These elements provide a unique reducible decomposition, known as the isotypic decomposition. For our purposes, this decomposition is remarkably handy to arrive at the sought after irreducible decomposition with respect to GL(d,$\mathbb{R}$). Then, we construct the elements in B$_n$(d) which realize the isotypic decomposition of a tensor under the action of O(d,$\mathbb{C}$). This decomposition is irreducible under O(d,$\mathbb{C}$) when applied to an irreducible GL(d,$\mathbb{C}$) tensor of order $5$ or less. As a by product of the construction, we give a solution to the problem of decomposing an arbitrary tensor into its traceless part, doubly traceless part and so on. These results led to the development of several Mathematica packages linked to the \textit{xAct} bundle for tensor calculus in field theory.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Low Mass Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the GW230529 event indicates that black hole-neutron star binaries can contain low-mass black holes. Since lower mass systems are more favourable for tidal disruption, such events are promising candidates for multi-messenger observations. In this study, we employ five finite-temperature, composition-dependent matter equations of state and present results from ten 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations for the mass ratios $q = 2.6$ and $5$. Two of these simulations target the chirp mass and effective spin parameter of the GW230529 event, while the remaining eight contain slightly higher-mass black holes, including both spinning ($a_{BH} = 0.7$) and non-spinning ($a_{BH} = 0$) models. We discuss the impact of the equation of state, spin, and mass ratio on black hole-neutron star mergers by examining both gravitational-wave and ejected matter properties. For the low-mass ratio model we do not see fast-moving ejecta for the softest equation of state model, but the stiffer model produces on the order of $10^{-6}M_\odot$ of fast-moving ejecta, expected to contribute to an electromagnetic counterpart. Notably, the high-mass ratio model produces nearly the same amount of total dynamical ejecta, but yields $52$ times more fast-moving ejecta than the low-mass ratio system. In addition, we observe that the black-hole spin tends to decrease the amount of fast-moving ejecta while increasing significantly the total ejected mass. Finally, we note that the disc mass tends to increase as the neutron star compactness decreases.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy is a relationship between classical solutions in gauge and gravity theories, and has previously been applied to vacuum solutions in both General Relativity and its generalisations. There have also been suggestions that the Weyl double copy should extend to solutions with non-trivial sources. In this paper, we provide a systematic derivation of sourced Weyl double copy formulae, using spinorial methods previously established for ${\cal N}=0$ supergravity. As a cross-check, we rederive the same formulae using a tensorial approach, which then allows us to extend our arguments to sources containing arbitrary powers of the inverse radial coordinate. We also generalise our results to include the Kerr-Newman black hole, clarifying previous alternative double copy formulae presented in the literature. Our results extend the validity of the Weyl double copy, and may be useful for further astrophysical applications of this correspondence.</description>

      <title>What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution exhibits regularity, free from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions to obtain a Weyl gauge invariant theory. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is `pure gauge', the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields are of geometric origin, with no added matter or compensating Weyl scalars, etc. The calculation is done in a Weyl {\it gauge covariant} and {\it metric} formulation of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution and thermality via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer, and its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <title>Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions. It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry. Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Wave Signals from Precessing Binary Black Hole Systems using Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current searches for gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole binaries using the LIGO and Virgo observatories are limited to analytical models for systems with black hole spins aligned (or anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum of the binary. Detecting black hole binaries with precessing spinsis crucial for gaining unique astrophysical insights into the formation of these sources. Therefore, it is essential to develop a search strategy capable of identifying compact binaries with precessing spins. Aligned-spin waveform models are inadequate for detecting compact binaries with high precessing spins. While several efforts have been made to construct template banks for detecting precessing binaries using matched filtering, this approach requires many templates to cover the entire search parameter space, significantly increasing the computational cost. This work explores the detection of GW signals from binary black holes(BBH) with both aligned and precessing spins using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We frame the detection of GW signals from aligned or precessing BBH systems as a hierarchical binary classification problem. The first CNN model classifies strain data as either pure noise or noisy signals (GWs from BBH). A second CNN model then classifies the detected noisy signal data as originating from either precessing or non-precessing (aligned/anti-aligned) systems. Using simulated data, the trained classifier distinguishes between noise and noisy GW signals with more than 99% accuracy. The second classifier further differentiates between aligned and highly precessing signals with around 95% accuracy. We extended our analysis to a multi-detector framework by performing a coincident test. Additionally, we tested the performance of our trained architecture on data from the first three observation runs of LIGO to identify detected BBH events as either aligned or precessing.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper by the author was proposed a new metric for the gravitational field of a thin rotating disk physically different from the Kerr metric. The metric is admissible for any angular momentum of the disk. As demonstrated in the present paper the parameter determining the angular momentum of the Milky Way greatly exceeds its gravitational radius so that the Kerr metric physically admissible only if the angular momentum is sufficiently small is completely inapplicable to the Milky Way. It is shown on the basis of the new metric that the rotation of the Milky Way plays a decisive role in the motion of satellites in its gravitational field. The effects due to the rotation can imitate the presence of hypothetical dark matter.</description>

Abstract: It has been established that the famous three-dimensional Thurston geometries have four intrinsically Lorentzian analogs. We explore these spacetimes in three-dimensional general relativity nonminimally coupled to a scalar field together with electromagnetic matter. We find that three of these spacetimes support electromagnetic radiation, while, the other is partially sourced by a nonnull field and supports gravitational radiation. By addressing this problem we have also found a novel type of gravitational Cheshire effect.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we use the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to constrain the parameters of braneworld black holes which constrain $\epsilon=0.0285^{+0.0888+0.1456}_{-0.0895-0.1475}$ for the anisotropic black hole and $q=-0.0305^{+0.1034+0.1953}_{-0.0895-0.1470}$ for the tidal Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (RN) black hole. Based on the fitted data and physical requirement, we calculate the photon deflection, the angular separation and time delay between different relativistic images of the anisotropic black hole and the tidal RN black hole in the ranges $-0.1190&lt;\epsilon&lt;0$ and $-0.1775 &lt;q&lt;0$. And furthermore, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for the braneworld black holes. The results shed light on existence of extra dimension.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on planetary-mass primordial black holes using LIGO O3a data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass inspiraling compact objects would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). We perform the first search for inspiraling planetary-mass compact objects in equal-mass and highly asymmetric mass-ratio binaries using data from the first half of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run. Though we do not find any significant candidates, we determine the maximum luminosity distance reachable with our search to be of $O(0.1-100)$ kpc, and corresponding model-independent upper limits on the merger rate densities to be $O(10^{3}-10^{-7})$ kpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for systems with chirp masses of $O(10^{-4}-10^{-2})M_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we interpret these rate densities as arising from PBH binaries and constrain the fraction of dark matter that such objects could comprise. For equal-mass PBH binaries, we find that these objects would compose less than 4-100% of DM for PBH masses of $10^{-2}M_\odot$ to $2\times 10^{-3}M_\odot$, respectively. For asymmetric binaries, assuming one black hole mass corresponds to a peak in the mass function at 2.5$M_\odot$, a PBH dark-matter fraction of 10% and a second, much lighter PBH, we constrain the mass function of the second PBH to be less than 1 for masses between $1.5\times 10^{-5}M_\odot$ and $2\times 10^{-4}M_\odot$. Our constraints, released on Zenodo, are robust enough to be applied to any PBH or exotic compact object binary formation models, and complement existence microlensing results. More details about our search can be found in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Numerical Study of Scalar Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility that quantum geometry effects may alleviate the apparent tensions existing at large angular scales in the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background explains the increasing interest in considering primordial perturbations within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. In this framework, a number of approximations have been suggested to simplify the study of perturbations and derive analytic expressions for the power spectra. This study requires a new choice of vacuum state that takes into account the preinflationary background geometry, choice for which we adopt the so-called NO-AHD prescription. Here, we apply the aforementioned approximations to the investigation of scalar perturbations. We discuss two approaches to the quantization of perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology, namely the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches. We improve previous approximations by including slow-roll corrections in the inflationary era. Moreover, for the first time in the literature of the NO-AHD prescription, we compute numerically the primordial power spectra for the two considered approaches, and show that the analytic estimations are remarkably accurate for all observable modes. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the spectra obtained with those two approaches.</description>

Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples (even including some simple sources) for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>

Abstract: General relativity is highly successful in explaining a wide range of gravitational phenomena including the gravitational waves emitted by binary systems and the shadows cast by supermassive black holes. From a modern perspective the theory is not fundamental though, but constitutes the lowest order term in an effective field theory description of the gravitational force. As a consequence, the gravitational dynamics should receive corrections by higher-derivative terms. This essay discusses structural aspects associated with these corrections and summarizes their imprint on static, spherically symmetric geometries. Along these lines, we critically reassess the common practice of using local field redefinitions in order to simplify the dynamics at the danger of shifting physics effects into sectors which are beyond the approximation under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choptuik's critical phenomena in general relativity is revisited in the affine-null metric formulation of Einstein's equations for a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. Numerical solutions are obtained by evolution of initial data using pseudo-spectral methods. The underlying system consists of differential equations along the outgoing null rays which can be solved in sequential form. A new two-parameter family of initial data is presented for which these equations can be integrated analytically. Specific choices of the initial data parameters correspond to either an asymptotically flat null cone, a black hole event horizon or the singular interior of a black hole. Our main focus is on the interior features of a black hole, for which the affine-null system is especially well adapted. We present both analytic and numerical results describing the geometric properties of the apparent horizon and final singularity. Using a re-gridding technique for the affine parameter, numerical evolution of initially asymptotically flat supercritical data can be continued inside the event horizon and track the apparent horizon up to the formation of the final singularity.</description>

      <title>Violation of $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$ complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source. Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result $\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$ where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars, and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent Kantowski-Sachs spherically symmetric teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity in vacuum and in a perfect isotropic fluid. We begin by finding the field equations and solve for new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. With a power-law ansatz for the coframe functions, we find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ vacuum solutions. We then proceed to find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions in a perfect isotropic fluid with both linear and non-linear equation of state. We find a great number of new exact and approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. These classes of new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Bianchi I geometry coupled to several species of comoving barotropic perfect fluids with a linear equation of state in the context of general relativity. The solution of the dynamics can be reduced to a quadrature, which can be explicitly performed in certain cases. In particular, we obtain the explicit solution for one species, as well as for two species, given their barotropic indices obey certain relation. These solutions include and generalize different models studied in the literature. For completeness, we analyze all the different possible signs of the matter energy densities, and we obtain a particularly interesting model in which an exotic species produces a bounce of the scale factor, providing a singularity-free cosmology, and then decays to leave a nonexotic component as the dominant fluid for large volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>

      <title>The scalar-torsion gravity corrections in the first-order inflationary models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the corrections to the cosmological models based on the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity induced by the non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion. To determine these corrections, we consider a power-law parametrization of the deviations between the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and the scalar-torsion gravity. The estimates of the possible influence of the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and torsion on the background cosmological parameters and the parameters of cosmological perturbations for the inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of the scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models based on observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the holographic dark energy model with axial torsion which satisfy the cosmological principle. Subsequently, by using the torsional analogues of Friedmann equations for the new equation from Einstein-Cartan gravity theory, we obtain the equation of state for dark energy in this model. We find that the extended holographic dark energy from the particle horizon as the infrared (IR) cut-off does not give the accelerating expansion of the universe. Also, employing the future event horizon as IR cut-off still achieves the accelerating expansion of the universe. In contrast, there is a possibility that the Hubble radius as IR cut-off achieves to the accelerating expansion of the universe in superluminal region for axial torsion. More precisely, the current value of ratio for torsion to the matter density, $\gamma^{0}=0.5$ gives the equation of state of dark energy $\omega_{\Lambda}\cong-1$.</description>

      <title>A path integral formula of quantum gravity emergent from entangled local structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We couple to group field theory (GFT) a scalar field that encodes the entanglement between manifold sites. The scalar field provides a relational clock that enables the derivation of the Hamiltonian of the system from the GFT action. Inspecting the Hamiltonian, we show that a theory of emergent gravity arises, and that this can be recast according to the Ashtekar's formulation of general relativity. The evolution of the GFT observables is regulated by the Shroedinger equation generated by the Hamiltonian. This is achieved by imposing a renormalization group (RG) flow that corresponds to a simplified Ricci flow. As a consequence of the quantization procedure, the Hamiltonian is recovered to be non-Hermitian, and can be related to the complex action formalism, in which the initial conditions and the related future evolution of the systems are dictated by the imaginary part of the action.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Background Dynamics with a Cosmological-model-independent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$ tension has emerged as the most serious crisis in modern cosmology, potentially indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM model may not describe our universe accurately. In this paper, we establish a new, cosmological-model-independent method to study the cosmic background dynamics. Using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample and the model-independent SN Ia sample (P+1690), we derive values for the luminosity distance, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter at five different redshift points ranging from 0.12 to 0.52. Our analysis shows that results obtained from the Pantheon+ sample align with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model within 2$\sigma$ confidence level (CL), while those obtained from the P+1690 sample exhibit deviations of about $2\sim3\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we explore the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and find that while the EoS values from the Pantheon+ sample remain consistent with $-1$ within 2$\sigma$ CL, the P+1690 sample does not conform to this standard. These findings remain unchanged after the inclusion of the Hubble parameter measurements in our analysis. Our results indicate that the $\Lambda$CDM model remains compatible with the Pantheon+ SN Ia and the Hubble parameter measurements at 2$\sigma$ CL.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: Cosmology constraints from cluster abundances in the western Galactic hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster mass function traces the growth of linear density perturbations and provides valuable insights into the growth of structures, the nature of dark matter, and the cosmological parameters governing the Universe. The primary science goal of eROSITA, on board the {\it Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)} mission, launched in 2019, is to constrain cosmology through the evolution of cluster mass function. In this paper, we present the cosmological constraints obtained from 5259 clusters of galaxies detected over an area of 12791~deg$^2$ in the Western Galactic Hemisphere of the eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). The common footprint region between the eROSITA Survey and DES, KiDS, and HSC surveys is used for calibration of the scaling between X-ray count rate and their total mass through measurements of their weak gravitational lensing signal. eRASS1 cluster abundances constrain the $\Lambda$CDM parameters, which are the energy density of the total matter to $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, and the normalization of the density fluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.88\pm0.02$ and their combination yields $S_8=\sigma_8 (\Omega_\mathrm{m} / 0.3)^{0.5}=0.86\pm0.01$, consistent and at a similar precision with the state-of-the-art CMB measurements. eRASS1 cosmological experiment places a most stringent upper limit on the summed masses of left-handed light neutrinos to $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.22\mathrm{~eV}$ (95\% confidence interval). Combining eRASS1 cluster abundance measurements with CMB and ground-based neutrino oscillation experiments, we measure the summed neutrino masses to be $\sum m_\nu=0.08_{-0.02}^{+0.03}\mathrm{~eV}$ or $\sum m_\nu=0.12_{-0.01}^{+0.03}\mathrm{~eV}$ depending on the mass hierarchy scenario for neutrino eigenstates. eRASS1 cluster abundances significantly improve the constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter to $w=-1.12\pm0.12$.

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <title>Probing flavor violation and baryogenesis via primordial gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that observations of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin can shed light into the scale of flavor violation in a flavon model which also explains the mass hierarchy of fermions. The energy density stored in oscillations of the flavon field around the minimum of its potential redshifts as matter and is expected to dominate over radiation in the early universe. At the same time, the evolution of primordial gravitational waves acts as bookkeeping to understand the expansion history of the universe. Importantly, the gravitational wave spectrum is different if there is an early flavon dominated era compared to radiation domination expected from a standard cosmological model and this spectrum gets damped by the entropy released in flavon decays, determined by the mass of the flavon field $m_S$ and new scale of flavor violation $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We derive analytical expressions of the frequency above which the spectrum is damped, as-well-as the amount of damping, in terms of $m_S$ and $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We show that the damping of the gravitational wave spectrum would be detectable at BBO, DECIGO, U-DECIGO, $\mu-$ARES, LISA, CE and ET detectors for $\Lambda_{\rm FV}=10^{5-10}$ GeV and $m_S=\mathcal{O({\rm TeV})}$. Furthermore, the flavon decays can source the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We identify the $m_S-\Lambda_{\rm FV}$ parameter space where the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ is produced and can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA and ET. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently measured stochastic gravitational background signals by NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single-field inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>Criticality of global monopole charges in diverse dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct charged AdS black holes with a global monopole charge in diverse dimensions and study the thermodynamics. We find a critical monopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors. In the context of holography, this could be intepreted using the boundary degrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four dimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution using Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for black holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical point, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature shows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent $2$ and coefficient $-1/8$ in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from the scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals like fluids.</description>
