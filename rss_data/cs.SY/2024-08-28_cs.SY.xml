      <title>Stable dynamic pricing scheme independent of lane-choice models for high-occupancy-toll lanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stable dynamic pricing scheme is essential to guarantee the desired performance of high-occupancy-toll (HOT) lanes, where single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) can pay a price to use the HOT lanes. But existing methods apply to either only one type of lane-choice models with unknown parameters or different types of lane-choice models but with known parameters. In this study we present a new dynamic pricing scheme that is stable and applies to different types of lane-choice models with unknown parameters. There are two operational objectives for operating HOT lanes: (i) to maintain the free-flow condition to guarantee the travel time reliability; and (ii) to maximize the HOT lanes' throughput to minimize the system's total delay. The traffic dynamics on both HOT and general purpose (GP) lanes are described by point queue models, where the queueing times are determined by the demands and capacities. We consider three types of lane-choice models: the multinomial logit model when SOVs share the same value of time, the vehicle-based user equilibrium model when SOVs' values of time are heterogeneous and follow a distribution, and a general lane-choice model. We demonstrate that the second objective is approximately equivalent to the social welfare optimization principle for the logit model. Observing that the dynamic price and the excess queueing time on the GP lanes are linearly correlated in all the lane-choice models, we propose a feedback control method to determine the dynamic prices based on two integral controllers. We further present a method to estimate the parameters of a lane-choice model once its type is known. Analytically we prove that the equilibrium state of the closed-loop system with constant demand patterns is ideal, since the two objectives are achieved in it, and that it is asymptotically stable. With numerical examples we verify the effectiveness of the solution method.</description>

      <title>Energy Management for Prepaid Customers: A Linear Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing energy prices, low income households are known to forego or minimize the use of electricity to save on energy costs. If a household is on a prepaid electricity program, it can be automatically and immediately disconnected from service if there is no balance in its prepaid account. Such households need to actively ration the amount of energy they use by deciding which appliances to use and for how long. We present a tool that helps households extend the availability of their critical appliances by limiting the use of discretionary ones, and prevent disconnections. The proposed method is based on a linear optimization problem that only uses average power demand as an input and can be solved to optimality using a simple greedy approach. We compare the model with two mixed-integer linear programming models that require more detailed demand forecasts and optimization solvers for implementation. In a numerical case study based on real household data, we assess the performance of the different models under different accuracy and granularity of demand forecasts. Our results show that our proposed linear model is much simpler to implement, while providing similar performance under realistic circumstances.</description>

      <title>Constructive Nonlinear Control of Underactuated Systems via Zero Dynamics Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing underactuated systems is an inherently challenging control task due to fundamental limitations on how the control input affects the unactuated dynamics. Decomposing the system into actuated (output) and unactuated (zero) coordinates provides useful insight as to how input enters the system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the structure of this decomposition to formalize the idea of Zero Dynamics Policies (ZDPs) -- a mapping from the unactuated coordinates to desired actuated coordinates. Specifically, we show that a ZDP exists in a neighborhood of the origin, and prove that combining output stabilization with a ZDP results in stability of the full system state. We detail a constructive method of obtaining ZDPs in a neighborhood of the origin, and propose a learning-based approach which leverages optimal control to obtain ZDPs with much larger regions of attraction. We demonstrate that such a paradigm can be used to stabilize the canonical underactuated system of the cartpole, and showcase an improvement over the nominal performance of LQR.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Adaptive Dynamic Routing with Stability Guarantee for a Single-Origin-Single-Destination Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider learning-based adaptive dynamic routing for a single-origin-single-destination queuing network with stability guarantees. Specifically, we study a class of generalized shortest path policies that can be parameterized by only two constants via a piecewise-linear function. Using the Foster-Lyapunov stability theory, we develop a criterion on the parameters to ensure mean boundedness of the traffic state. Then, we develop a policy iteration algorithm that learns the parameters from realized sample paths. Importantly, the piecewise-linear function is both integrated into the Lyapunov function for stability analysis and used as a proxy of the value function for policy iteration; hence, stability is inherently ensured for the learned policy. Finally, we demonstrate via a numerical example that the proposed algorithm learns a near-optimal routing policy with an acceptable optimality gap but significantly higher computational efficiency compared with a standard neural network-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for T-S Fuzzy Markovian Jump Systems Using Dynamic Prediction Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the model predictive control (MPC) problem is investigated for the constrained discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy Markovian jump systems (FMJSs) under imperfect premise matching rules. To strike a balance between initial feasible region, control performance, and online computation burden, a set of mode-dependent state feedback fuzzy controllers within the frame of dynamic prediction optimizing (DPO)-MPC is delicately designed with the perturbation variables produced by the predictive dynamics. The DPO-MPC controllers are implemented via two stages: at the first stage, terminal constraints sets companied with feedback gain are obtained by solving a ``min-max'' problem; at the second stage, and a set of perturbations is designed felicitously to enlarge the feasible region. Here, dynamic feedback gains are designed for off-line using matrix factorization technique, while the dynamic controller state is determined for online over a moving horizon to gradually guide the system state from the initial feasible region to the terminal constraint set. Sufficient conditions are provided to rigorously ensure the recursive feasibility of the proposed DPO-MPC scheme and the mean-square stability of the underlying FMJS. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated through a robot arm system example.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Autonomous Intersection Management: Temporal Logic-based Safety Filters for Vehicle Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a temporal logic-based safety filter for Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM), an emerging infrastructure technology for connected vehicles to coordinate traffic flow through intersections. Despite substantial work on AIM systems, the balance between intersection safety and efficiency persists as a significant challenge. Building on recent developments in formal methods that now have become computationally feasible for AIM applications, we introduce an approach that starts with a temporal logic specification for the intersection and then uses reachability analysis to compute safe time-state corridors for the connected vehicles that pass through the intersection. By analyzing these corridors, in contrast to single trajectories, we can make explicit design decisions regarding safety-efficiency trade-offs while taking each vehicle's decision uncertainty into account. Additionally, we compute safe driving limits to ensure that vehicles remain within their designated safe corridors. Combining these elements, we develop a service that provides safety filters for AIM coordination of connected vehicles. We evaluate the practical feasibility of our safety framework using a simulated 4-way intersection, showing that our approach performs in real-time for multiple scenarios.</description>

      <title>Domain-decoupled Physics-informed Neural Networks with Closed-form Gradients for Fast Model Learning of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14951v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are trained using physical equations and can also incorporate unmodeled effects by learning from data. PINNs for control (PINCs) of dynamical systems are gaining interest due to their prediction speed compared to classical numerical integration methods for nonlinear state-space models, making them suitable for real-time control applications. We introduce the domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) to address current limitations of PINC in handling large and complex nonlinear dynamical systems. The time domain is decoupled from the feed-forward neural network to construct an Ansatz function, allowing for calculation of gradients in closed form. This approach significantly reduces training times, especially for large dynamical systems, compared to PINC, which relies on graph-based automatic differentiation. Additionally, the DD-PINN inherently fulfills the initial condition and supports higher-order excitation inputs, simplifying the training process and enabling improved prediction accuracy. Validation on three systems - a nonlinear mass-spring-damper, a five-mass-chain, and a two-link robot - demonstrates that the DD-PINN achieves significantly shorter training times. In cases where the PINC's prediction diverges, the DD-PINN's prediction remains stable and accurate due to higher physics loss reduction or use of a higher-order excitation input. The DD-PINN allows for fast and accurate learning of large dynamical systems previously out of reach for the PINC.</description>

      <title>Fixed-time Disturbance Observer-Based MPC Robust Trajectory Tracking Control of Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a fixed-time disturbance observerbased model predictive control algorithm is proposed for trajectory tracking of quadrotor in the presence of disturbances. First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit homogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of estimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial estimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is formulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the lumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Compact Pixelated Microstrip Forward Broadside Coupler Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a compact microstrip forward broadside coupler (MFBC) with high coupling level is proposed in the frequency band of 3.5-3.8 GHz. The coupler is composed of two parallel pixelated transmission lines. To validate the designstrategy, the proposed MFBC is fabricated and measured. The measured results demonstrate a forward coupler with 3 dB coupling, and a compact size of 0.12 {\lambda}g x 0.10{\lambda}g. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) design methodology and flexibility of pixelation enable us to optimize the proposed MFBC with desired coupling level and operating frequency within a fixed dimension. Also, low sensitivity to misalignment between two coupled TLs makes the proposed coupler a good candidate for near-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) application and sensors.</description>

      <title>Multitone PSK Modulation Design for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-field wireless power transfer, based on radio frequency (RF) waves, came into the picture to fulfill the power need of large Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the backbone of the 5G and beyond era. However, RF communication signals carry both information as well as energy. Therefore, recently, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has attracted much attention in order to wirelessly charge these IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel N -tone multitone phase shift keying (PSK) modulation scheme, taking advantage of the non-linearity of integrated receiver rectifier architecture. The main advantage of the proposed modulation scheme is the reduction in ripple voltage, introduced by the symbol transmission through phases. Achievable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and bit error rate (BER) at the output are considered to measure the efficacy of the proposed modulation scheme. Simulation results are verified by the measurements over the designed rectifier circuitry. The effect of symbol phase range, modulation order, and the number of tones are analyzed. In the future, this transmission scheme can be utilized to satisfy the data and power requirements of low-power Internet of Things sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Applications in CityLearn Gym Environment for Multi-Objective Control Benchmarking in Grid-Interactive Buildings and Districts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is challenging to coordinate multiple distributed energy resources in a single or multiple buildings to ensure efficient and flexible operation. Advanced control algorithms such as model predictive control and reinforcement learning control provide solutions to this problem by effectively managing a distribution of distributed energy resource control tasks while adapting to unique building characteristics, and cooperating towards improving multi-objective key performance indicator. Yet, a research gap for advanced control adoption is the ability to benchmark algorithm performance. CityLearn addresses this gap an open-source Gym environment for the easy implementation and benchmarking of simple rule-based control and advanced algorithms that has an advantage of modeling simplicity, multi-agent control, district-level objectives, and control resiliency assessment. Here we demonstrate the functionalities of CityLearn using 17 different building control problems that have varying complexity with respect to the number of controllable distributed energy resources in buildings, the simplicity of the control algorithm, the control objective, and district size.</description>

      <title>Data-enabled Predictive Repetitive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems are subject to periodic disturbances and exhibit repetitive behaviour. Model-based repetitive control employs knowledge of such periodicity to attenuate periodic disturbances and has seen a wide range of successful industrial implementations. The aim of this paper is to develop a data-driven repetitive control method. In the developed framework, linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) behaviour is lifted to linear time-invariant (LTI) behaviour. Periodic disturbance mitigation is enabled by developing an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma for systems with exogenous disturbances. The resulting Data-enabled Predictive Repetitive Control (DeePRC) technique accounts for periodic system behaviour to perform attenuation of a periodic disturbance. Simulations demonstrate the ability of DeePRC to effectively mitigate periodic disturbances in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Typical Operating Scenarios of New Power System Based on Deep Time Series Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting typical operational scenarios is essential for making flexible decisions in the dispatch of a new power system. This study proposed a novel deep time series aggregation scheme (DTSAs) to generate typical operational scenarios, considering the large amount of historical operational snapshot data. Specifically, DTSAs analyze the intrinsic mechanisms of different scheduling operational scenario switching to mathematically represent typical operational scenarios. A gramian angular summation field (GASF) based operational scenario image encoder was designed to convert operational scenario sequences into high-dimensional spaces. This enables DTSAs to fully capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of new power systems using deep feature iterative aggregation models. The encoder also facilitates the generation of typical operational scenarios that conform to historical data distributions while ensuring the integrity of grid operational snapshots. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method extracted new fine-grained power system dispatch schemes and outperformed the latest high-dimensional featurescreening methods. In addition, experiments with different new energy access ratios were conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed method. DTSAs enables dispatchers to master the operation experience of the power system in advance, and actively respond to the dynamic changes of the operation scenarios under the high access rate of new energy.</description>

      <title>Sub-Riemannian Geometry, Mixing, and the Holonomy of Optimal Mass Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) has in recent years spurred a fast developing phase of research in stochastic control, control of ensemble systems, thermodynamics, data science, and several other fields in engineering and science. Specifically, OMT endowed the space of probability distributions with a rich Riemannian-like geometry, the Wasserstein geometry and the Wasserstein $\mathcal W_2$-metric. This geometry proved fruitful in quantifying and regulating the uncertainty of deterministic and stochastic systems, and in dealing with problems related to the transport of ensembles in continuous and discrete spaces.
  We herein introduce a new type of transportation problems. The salient feature of these problems is that particles/agents in the ensemble, that are to be transported, are labeled and their relative position along their journey is of interest. Of particular importance in our program are closed orbits where particles return to their original place after being transported along closed paths. Thereby, control laws are sought so that the distribution of the ensemble traverses a closed orbit in the Wasserstein manifold without mixing. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about mixing of the flow, which is expected and allowed when traversing curves in the Wasserstein space.
  In the theory that we present, we explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule. From this vantage point, we discuss several other problems of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than what can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their weighted cumulative benefit, and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. Our simulations show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Planning for Rigid Robot Formations with Probabilistic Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed method for robots moving in rigid formations while ensuring probabilistic collision avoidance between the robots. The formation is parametrised through the transformation of a base configuration. The robots map their desired velocities into a corresponding desired change in the formation parameters and apply a consensus step to reach agreement on the desired formation and a constraint satisfaction step to ensure collision avoidance within the formation. The constraint set is found such that the probability of collision remains below an upper bound. The method was demonstrated in a manual teleoperation scenario both in simulation and a real-world experiment.</description>

      <title>Data-driven distributionally robust MPC for systems with multiplicative noise: A semi-infinite semi-definite programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) algorithm for a specific class of controlled dynamical systems where the disturbance multiplies the state and control variables. These classes of systems arise in mathematical finance, where the paradigm of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) fits perfectly, and this serves as the primary motivation for this work. We recast the optimal control problem (OCP) as a semi-definite program with an infinite number of constraints, making the ensuing optimization problem a \emph{semi-infinite semi-definite program} (SI-SDP). To numerically solve the SI-SDP, we advance an approach for solving convex semi-infinite programs (SIPs) to SI-SDPs and, subsequently, solve the DRMPC problem. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>SpecGuard: Specification Aware Recovery for Robotic Autonomous Vehicles from Physical Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic Autonomous Vehicles (RAVs) rely on their sensors for perception, and follow strict mission specifications (e.g., altitude, speed, and geofence constraints) for safe and timely operations. Physical attacks can corrupt the RAVs' sensors, resulting in mission failures. Recovering RAVs from such attacks demands robust control techniques that maintain compliance with mission specifications even under attacks to ensure the RAV's safety and timely operations.
  We propose SpecGuard, a technique that complies with mission specifications and performs safe recovery of RAVs. There are two innovations in SpecGuard. First, it introduces an approach to incorporate mission specifications and learn a recovery control policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL). We design a compliance-based reward structure that reflects the RAV's complex dynamics and enables SpecGuard to satisfy multiple mission specifications simultaneously. Second, SpecGuard incorporates state reconstruction, a technique that minimizes attack induced sensor perturbations. This reconstruction enables effective adversarial training, and optimizing the recovery control policy for robustness under attacks. We evaluate SpecGuard in both virtual and real RAVs, and find that it achieves 92% recovery success rate under attacks on different sensors, without any crashes or stalls. SpecGuard achieves 2X higher recovery success than prior work, and incurs about 15% performance overhead on real RAVs.</description>

      <title>Risk-aware Scheduling and Dispatch of Flexibility Events in Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential and commercial buildings, equipped with systems such as heat pumps (HPs), hot water tanks, or stationary energy storage, have a large potential to offer their consumption flexibility as grid services. In this work, we leverage this flexibility to react to consumption requests related to maximizing self-consumption and reducing peak loads. We employ a data-driven virtual storage modeling approach for flexibility prediction in the form of flexibility envelopes for individual buildings. The risk-awareness of this prediction is inherited by the proposed scheduling algorithm. A Mixed-integer Linear Program (MILP) is formulated to schedule the activation of a pool of buildings in order to best respond to an external aggregated consumption request. This aggregated request is then dispatched to the active individual buildings, based on the previously determined schedule. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by coordinating up to 500 simulated buildings using the Energym Python library and observing about 1.5 times peak power reduction in comparison with a baseline approach while maintaining comfort more robustly. We demonstrate the scalability of the approach by solving problems with 2000 buildings in about 21 seconds, with solving times being approximately linear in the number of considered assets.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Unsupervised Anomaly detection framework in multivariate time-series of industrial dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a new model-free anomaly detection framework is proposed for time-series induced by industrial dynamical systems. The framework lies in the category of conventional approaches which enable appealing features such as, a fast learning with reduced amount of learning data, a reduced memory, a high potential for explainability as well as easiness of incremental learning mechanism to incorporate operator feedback after an alarm is raised an analyzed. All these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solution by industry but they are rarely considered in the comparisons between competing methods which generally exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Baseline Results for Selected Nonlinear System Identification Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear system identification remains an important open challenge across research and academia. Large numbers of novel approaches are seen published each year, each presenting improvements or extensions to existing methods. It is natural, therefore, to consider how one might choose between these competing models. Benchmark datasets provide one clear way to approach this question. However, to make meaningful inference based on benchmark performance it is important to understand how well a new method performs comparatively to results available with well-established methods. This paper presents a set of ten baseline techniques and their relative performances on five popular benchmarks. The aim of this contribution is to stimulate thought and discussion regarding objective comparison of identification methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shifted frequency-based electromagnetic transient (SFEMT) simulation has greatly improved the computational efficiency of traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation for the ac grid. This letter proposes a novel interface for the co-simulation of the SFEMT model and the traditional EMT model. The general form of SFEMT modeling and the principle of analytical signal construction are first derived. Then, an interface for the co-simulation of EMT and SFEMT simulation is proposed based on rotational invariance techniques. Theoretical analyses and test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Control-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Chemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a control-informed reinforcement learning (CIRL) framework that integrates proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control components into the architecture of deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies. The proposed approach augments deep RL agents with a PID controller layer, incorporating prior knowledge from control theory into the learning process. CIRL improves performance and robustness by combining the best of both worlds: the disturbance-rejection and setpoint-tracking capabilities of PID control and the nonlinear modeling capacity of deep RL. Simulation studies conducted on a continuously stirred tank reactor system demonstrate the improved performance of CIRL compared to both conventional model-free deep RL and static PID controllers. CIRL exhibits better setpoint-tracking ability, particularly when generalizing to trajectories outside the training distribution, suggesting enhanced generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the embedded prior control knowledge within the CIRL policy improves its robustness to unobserved system disturbances. The control-informed RL framework combines the strengths of classical control and reinforcement learning to develop sample-efficient and robust deep reinforcement learning algorithms, with potential applications in complex industrial systems.</description>

      <title>InPTC: Integrated Planning and Tube-Following Control for Prescribed-Time Collision-Free Navigation of Wheeled Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach, called InPTC (Integrated Planning and Tube-Following Control), for prescribed-time collision-free navigation of wheeled mobile robots in a compact convex workspace cluttered with static, sufficiently separated, and convex obstacles. A path planner with prescribed-time convergence is presented based upon Bouligand's tangent cones and time scale transformation (TST) techniques, yielding a continuous vector field that can guide the robot from almost all initial positions in the free space to the designated goal at a prescribed time, while avoiding entering the obstacle regions augmented with safety margin. By leveraging barrier functions and TST, we further derive a tube-following controller to achieve robot trajectory tracking within a prescribed time less than the planner's settling time. This controller ensures the robot moves inside a predefined ``safe tube'' around the reference trajectory, where the tube radius is set to be less than the safety margin. Consequently, the robot will reach the goal location within a prescribed time while avoiding collision with any obstacles along the way. The proposed InPTC is implemented on a Mona robot operating in an arena cluttered with obstacles of various shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that InPTC not only generates smooth collision-free reference trajectories that converge to the goal location at the preassigned time of $250\,\rm s$ (i.e., the required task completion time), but also achieves tube-following trajectory tracking with tracking accuracy higher than $0.01\rm m$ after the preassigned time of $150\,\rm s$. This enables the robot to accomplish the navigation task within the required time of $250\,\rm s$.</description>

      <title>Structured Deep Neural Networks-Based Backstepping Trajectory Tracking Control for Lagrangian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to learn controllers due to their excellent approximation capabilities. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</description>
