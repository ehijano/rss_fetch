      <title>Classification of ancient ovals in higher dimensional mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact non-selfsimilar ancient noncollapsed solutions to the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, called ancient ovals. Our main result is the classification of $k$-ovals: any $k$-oval (characterized by having cylindrical blow down $\mathbb{R}^k\times S^{n-k}$ and the quadratic bending asymptotics) belongs, up to space-time rigid motions and parabolic dilations, to the family of ancient ovals constructed by Haslhofer and the second author. Assuming the nonexistence of exotic ovals (recently proved by Bamler-Lai), this yields a classification of all ancient ovals and identifies the moduli space, modulo symmetries, with an open $(k-1)$-simplex modulo the symmetry of simplex. Although these conclusions are contained in the recent breakthrough of Bamler-Lai classifying all ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows and resolving the mean convex neighborhood conjecture, we give an alternative argument for the independently obtained classification of $k$-ovals in arbitrary dimensions based on a different spectral parametrization.</description>

      <title>Linear Quantitative Rigidity for Almost-CMC Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative rigidity result for almost constant mean curvature spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Under a sub--two--sphere Willmore bound and a small $L^2$--CMC defect, we show that an almost--CMC surface is close to the round sphere, with linear control of the $W^{2,2}$--distance of the parametrization and the $L^\infty$--norm of the conformal factor. An analogous statement holds under an a priori area bound below that of two spheres.The proof relies on a linearized analysis around the sphere. A previously established qualitative rigidity result provides the initial closeness required to enter the perturbative regime. The estimate further extends to integral $2$--varifolds of unit density using known regularity and density results.</description>

      <title>Multiple cluster algebra structures for TCD maps I: theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce triple crossing diagram (TCD) maps, which encode projective configurations of points and lines, as a unified framework for constructions arising in various areas of geometry, such as discrete differential geometry, discrete geometric dynamics and hyperbolic geometry. We define two types of local moves for TCD maps, one of which is governed by the discrete Schwarzian KP (dSKP) equation, and establish their multi-dimensional consistency. We construct two distinct cluster structures on the space of TCD maps, called projective and affine cluster structures, and show that they are related via an operation called section. This framework organizes and unifies a wide range of examples, including Q-nets, Darboux maps, line complexes, T-graphs, t-embeddings, triangulations and geometric discrete integrable systems such as the pentagram map and cross-ratio dynamics, which are further developed in a companion paper and in (arXiv:2108.12692).</description>

      <title>On unions of geodesics and projections of invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $d$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold and let $\pi: SM \to M$ denote the canonical projection from the unit tangent bundle. We prove that if $E \subset SM$ is a set that invariant under the geodesic flow with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_{\mathcal{H}} E \ge 2(k-1)+1 +\beta$ for some integer $1 \le k \le d-1$ and some $\beta \in [0,1]$, then the projection $\pi(E)$ satisfies $\dim_{\mathcal{H}} \pi(E) \ge k + \beta$. In other words, this yields a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of unions of geodesics in $M$. Our theorem extends a result of J. Zahl concerning unions of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proof relies on the transversal property of geodesics, an appropriate $(k+1)$-linear curved Kakeya estimate, and the Bourgain-Guth argument.</description>

      <title>On the classification of Serrin planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that all smooth ring domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ that admit a solution to Serrin's classical problem $\Delta u+2=0$ with locally constant overdetermined boundary conditions along $\partial \Omega$ can be described as algebro-geometric potentials of the mKdV hierarchy. The same result holds for periodic unbounded domains with two boundary components. In particular, any such domain is determined by suitable holomorphic data in some algebraic curve. As a consequence, the space of all Serrin ring domains, or periodic Serrin bands, can be ordered into a sequence of finite-dimensional complexity levels. By studying the first non-trivial level, given by elliptic functions, we construct: $(i)$ a global $1$-parameter family of periodic solutions to Serrin's problem that interpolates between a flat band and a chain of disks along an axis, following an unduloid pattern, and $(ii)$ for any $n&gt;1$, a two-dimensional moduli space ${\bf T}_n$ of non-radial Serrin ring domains with a dihedral symmetry group of order $2n$. This moduli space ${\bf T}_n$ is geometrically a triangle, and has radial bands on one side of ${\bf T}_n$, and a necklace of $n$ pairwise tangent disks distributed along the unit circle at its opposite vertex in ${\bf T}_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For oriented surfaces $\Sigma$ with boundary, we consider the infinite-dimensional deformation space of projective structures on $\Sigma$ with nondegenerate boundary, up to isotopies fixing the boundary. We show that this space carries a natural symplectic structure, and is a Hamiltonian space for the symplectic groupoid integrating the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii-space of the boundary.</description>

      <title>The Jet Isomorphism Theorem of Riemannian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:1509.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Riemannian geometry, due in its original form to Cartan, states that the Taylor expansion of the metric in geodesic normal coordinates is a universal formal power series involving only the symmetrizations of the iterated covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor; this is known as the jet isomorphism theorem. In particular, it is in principle possible to reconstruct the jet of the curvature tensor from its symmetrization in geodesic normal coordinates, although this would certainly result in an unwieldy computation. In this paper we achieve the same goal by coordinate-free calculations, using only the intrinsic definition of the relevant Young symmetrizers.</description>

      <title>A general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves a general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ on a compact orbifold $E$, subject to suitable limiting conditions on the metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ as $\mu \to \infty$. The result is distinct from similar theorems in the literature since it does not require bounds on curvature or injectivity radius of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ and thus allows for Gromov-Hausdorff limits of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ which have strictly lower dimension than $E$. The paper also introduces and studies a new class of stratified fibrations between orbifolds, termed weak submersions, and new classes of geometric structures on orbifolds, termed stratified Riemannian metrics, stratified Riemannian semi-metrics and stratified quasi-Finslerian structures, all of which play a key role in the proof of the main theorem.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and associated collapsing results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses scaling arguments to prove the unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms for two explicit closed 7-manifolds. The first manifold is the product $X \times S^1$ (where $X$ is the Nakamura manifold constructed by de Bartolomeis-Tomassini) equipped with a 4-dimensional family of closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and is inspired by a short paper of Fern\'{a}ndez. The second is the manifold recently constructed by Fern\'{a}ndez-Fino-Kovalev-Mu\~{n}oz. In the latter example, careful resolution of singularities is required, in order to ensure that the rescaled forms are cohomologically constant. By combining suitable geometric estimates with a general collapsing theorem for orbifolds recently obtained by the author, explicit descriptions of the large volume limits of both manifolds are also obtained. The proofs in this paper are notable for not requiring explicit solution of the Laplacian flow evolution PDE for closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, thereby allowing treatment of manifolds which lack the high degree of symmetry generally required for Laplacian flow to be explicitly soluble.</description>

Abstract: We show that the combination of nonnegative 2-intermediate Ricci Curvature and strict positivity of scalar curvature forces rigidity of two-sided free boundary stable minimal hypersurface in a 4-manifold with bounded geometry and weakly convex boundary. This extends the method of Chodosh-Li-Stryker to free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in ambient manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper combines explicit local calculations with covering arguments to prove the unboundedness above and below (in a logarithmic sense) of the Donaldson-Hitchin functionals on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms, over compact manifolds (or, more generally, orbifolds) with boundary. In addition, the Donaldson-Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms over compact manifolds (or orbifolds) with boundary is shown to be unbounded below. As scholia, the critical points of the functionals on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms are shown to be saddles, and initial conditions of the Laplacian coflow which do not lead to convergent solutions are shown to be dense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two new spectral invariants of torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on closed orbifolds and computes their values on all Joyce orbifolds. These invariants are shown to be more discerning than the $\overline{\nu}$-invariant of Crowley-Goette-Nordstr\"{o}m when applied to Joyce orbifolds, and thus provide candidate tools for distinguishing between Joyce manifolds. The invariants may be viewed as regularisations of the classical Morse indices of the critical points of the Hitchin functionals on closed and coclosed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures respectively. In the case of Joyce orbifolds, an interesting link with twisted Epstein $\zeta$-functions is also observed.</description>

      <title>Relative $h$-principles for closed stable forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration to develop a new, general method for proving relative $h$-principles for closed, stable, exterior forms on manifolds. This method is applied to prove the relative $h$-principle for 4 classes of closed stable forms which were previously not known to satisfy the $h$-principle, $\textit{viz.}$ stable $(2k-2)$-forms in $2k$ dimensions, stable $(2k-1)$-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms. The method is also used to produce new, unified proofs of all three previously established $h$-principles for closed, stable forms, $\textit{viz.}$ the $h$-principles for closed stable 2-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms and closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ 3-forms. In addition, it is shown that if a class of closed stable forms satisfies the relative $h$-principle, then the corresponding Hitchin functional (whenever defined) is necessarily unbounded above.
  Due to the general nature of the $h$-principles considered in this paper, the application of convex integration requires an analogue of Hodge decomposition on arbitrary $n$-manifolds (possibly non-compact, or with boundary) which cannot, to the author's knowledge, be found elsewhere in the literature. Such a decomposition is proven in Appendix A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two $p$-eigenvalue pinching sphere theorems, for the \( p \)-Laplacian, $p&gt;1$. The first result states that if the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold with sectional curvature $K_{M}\geq 1$ is sufficiently close to the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of $\mathbb{S}^{n}$ then $M$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. The second states that if the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold with Ricci curvature ${\rm Ric}_{M}\geq (n-1)$ and injectivity radius ${\rm inj}_{M}\geq i_0&gt;0$ is sufficiently close to the first non-zero $p$-eigenvalue of $\mathbb{S}^{n}$ then $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. Our results extend sphere theorems originally settled for the Laplacian by S. Croke~\cite{Croke1982} and G.P. Bessa~\cite{bessa} respectively.</description>

As corollaries, it is proven that if an oriented 6-manifold $\mathrm{M}$ admits any $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form, then every degree 3 cohomology class on $\mathrm{M}$ can be represented by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and, moreover, that the corresponding Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms representing this class is necessarily unbounded above. Essential to the proof of the $h$-principle is a careful analysis of the rank 3 distributions induced by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and their interaction with generic pairs of hyperplanes. The proof also introduces a new property of sets in affine space, termed macilence, as a method of verifying ampleness.</description>

Abstract: This paper uses algebro-topological techniques such as characteristic classes and obstruction theory, together with the $h$-principles for $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms recently established by the author and the $h$-principle for $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms established by Donaldson, to prove results on the topological properties of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on oriented 6- and 7-manifolds. Specifically, a criterion for an arbitrary oriented 7-manifold to admit a closed (resp. coclosed) $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structure is obtained, proving a conjecture of L\^{e}; a generalisation of Donaldson's '$\mathrm{G}_2$-cobordisms' to $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms is introduced, with homotopic $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms in a given cohomology class shown to be $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-cobordant, a result which currently has no analogue in the $\mathrm{G}_2$ case; and a complete classification of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms up to homotopy is provided. Additionally, a lower bound on the number of homotopy classes of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on a given manifold is obtained, and the question of which closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms arise as the boundary values of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structures on oriented 7-manifolds is investigated.</description>

      <title>On the smooth Lorentzian optimal transport problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we want to establish some general results in the Lorentzian optimal transport theory that have well-known Riemannian counterparts. As a first result, we will provide non-trivial assumptions on the measures to ensure strong (Kantorovich) duality, i.e. the existence of a maximizing pair in the dual optimal transport formulation. We will also show that, under suitable assumptions, optimality of a causal coupling is characterized by $c$-cyclical monotonicity. The second result deals with the regularity of $c$-convex functions and (weak) Kantorovich potentials. We show that, in general, regularity results known in the Riemannian context do not extend to the Lorentzian setting. Under suitable assumptions on the measures, we will prove nevertheless that these (weak) potentials are locally semconvex on an open set of full measure. As our last result, we will prove that, under quite general assumptions, for any two intermediates measures along a displacement interpolation, there exists a $C^{1,1}_{loc}$-regular maximizing pair in the dual formulation.</description>
