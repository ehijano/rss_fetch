      <title>Inferring and predicting Fried physical frailty phenotype deficits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the Fried physical frailty phenotype health deficits (FPFP5: slow gait, weakness, weight loss, low activity, and exhaustion) using two measures of frailty: frailty index (FI) or frailty phenotype (FP). The FP theorizes that the FPFP5 are mutually dependent through shared etiology and positive feedbacks, so that the total number of FPFP5 deficits (NFPFP5) should be highly predictive of existing deficits. Alternatively, the FI theorizes that strong mutual dependencies exist between \emph{all} age-related health deficits, so that the FI would be more predictive. We investigated predictive models of FPFP5 using FI or NFPFP5 in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We find that the FI, chronological age, and current deficit state are all important predictors of future FPFP5 deficits. Notably, the FI consistently out-performed NFPFP5, raising questions regarding FPFP5 causal connections and how best to measure the physical component of frailty. We discuss implications for both FPFP5 forecasting, and inference when data are missing or incomplete.</description>

      <title>Predicting novel pharmacological activities of compounds using PubChem IDs and machine learning (CID-SID ML model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance and Object: The proposed methodology aims to provide time- and cost-effective approach for the early stage in drug discovery. The machine learning models developed in this study used only the identification numbers provided by PubChem. Thus, a drug development researcher who has obtained a PubChem CID and SID can easily identify new functionality of their compound. The approach was demonstrated, using four bioassay which were on (i) the antagonists of human D3 dopamine receptors; (ii) the promoter Rab9 activators; (iii) small molecule inhibitors of CHOP to regulate the unfolded protein response to ER stress; (iv) antagonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor. Solution: The four bioassays used for demonstration of the approach were provided by PubChem. For each bioassay, the generated by PubChem CIDs, SIDs were extracted together with the corresponding activity. The resulting dataset was sifted with the dataset on a water solubility bioassay, remaining only the compounds common for both bioassays. In this way, the inactive compounds were reduced. Then, all active compounds were added, and the resulted dataset was later used for machine learning based on scikit learn algorithms. Results: The average values of the ML models` metrics for the four bioassays were: 83.82% Accuracy with 5.35 standard deviation; 87.9% Precision with 5.04 standard deviation; 77.1% Recall with 7.65 standard deviation; 82.1% F1 with 6.44 standard deviation; 83.4% ROC with 5.09 standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Molecule-dynamic-based Aging Clock and Aging Roadmap Forecast with Sundial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the unavoidable bias inherent in supervised aging clocks, we introduce Sundial, a novel framework that models molecular dynamics through a diffusion field, capturing both the population-level aging process and the individual-level relative aging order. Sundial enables unbiasedestimation of biological age and the forecast of aging roadmap. Fasteraging individuals from Sundial exhibit a higher disease risk compared to those identified from supervised aging clocks. This framework opens new avenues for exploring key topics, including age- and sex-specific aging dynamics and faster yet healthy aging paths.</description>

      <title>Genomic and pathological analyses of an asymmetric true hermaphroditism case in a female labrador retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two main gonadal development disorders in dogs are true hermaphroditism and XX male syndrome. True hermaphroditism can be divided into two subcategories: XX sex reversal and XY sex reversal. XX Sry-negative sex reversal is more common, and it is characterized by the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissues in an animal. To date, there are 16 cases of true hermaphroditism reported in the literature, 15 of which are XX true hermaphroditism. Hermaphroditism has not been formally documented in labrador retrievers, and no case of asymmetric hermaphroditism has been reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Beware of so-called 'good' correlations: a statistical reality check on individual mRNA-protein predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in the life sciences often employs messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) quantification as a standalone approach for functional analysis. However, although the correlation between the measured levels of mRNA and proteins is positive, correlation coefficients observed empirically are incomplete, necessitating caution in making agnostic inferences. This essay provides a statistical reflection and caveat on the concept of correlation strength in the context of transcriptomics-proteomics studies. It highlights the variability in possible protein levels at given empirical correlation values, even for precise mRNA amount, and underscores the notable proportion of mRNA-protein pairs with abundances at opposite ends of their respective distributions. Cell biologists, data scientists, and biostatisticians should recognise that mRNA-protein correlation alone is insufficient to justify using a single mRNA quantification to infer the amount or function of its corresponding protein.</description>

      <title>From thermodynamics to protein design: Diffusion models for biomolecule generation towards autonomous protein engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein design with desirable properties has been a significant challenge for many decades. Generative artificial intelligence is a promising approach and has achieved great success in various protein generation tasks. Notably, diffusion models stand out for their robust mathematical foundations and impressive generative capabilities, offering unique advantages in certain applications such as protein design. In this review, we first give the definition and characteristics of diffusion models and then focus on two strategies: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Score-based Generative Models, where DDPM is the discrete form of SGM. Furthermore, we discuss their applications in protein design, peptide generation, drug discovery, and protein-ligand interaction. Finally, we outline the future perspectives of diffusion models to advance autonomous protein design and engineering. The E(3) group consists of all rotations, reflections, and translations in three-dimensions. The equivariance on the E(3) group can keep the physical stability of the frame of each amino acid as much as possible, and we reflect on how to keep the diffusion model E(3) equivariant for protein generation.</description>

      <title>RealDiffFusionNet: Neural Controlled Differential Equation Informed Multi-Head Attention Fusion Networks for Disease Progression Modeling Using Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach named RealDiffFusionNet incorporating Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDE) - time series models that are robust in handling irregularly sampled data - and multi-head attention to align relevant multimodal context (image data, time invariant data, etc.) at each time point. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models were also used as a baseline. Two different datasets were used: a data from the Open-Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) containing structured time series data of demographics and lung function with a baseline CT scan of the lungs and the second from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) containing a series of MRI scans along with demographics, physical examinations, and cognitive assessment data. An ablation study was performed to understand the role of CDEs, multimodal data, attention fusion, and interpolation strategies on model performance. When the baseline models were evaluated, the use of multimodal data resulted in an improvement in Neural CDE performance, with a lower test RMSE. Additionally, the performance of multimodal Neural CDE was also superior to multimodal LSTM. In the attention-based architectures, fusion through concatenation and rectilinear interpolation were found to improve model performance. The performance of the proposed RealDiffFusionNet was found to be superior (0.2570) to all models. For the ADNI dataset, between the Neural-CDE and LSTM models trained only on the structured data, the test RMSE were comparable (0.471 for LSTM vs. 0.4581 Neural-CDE). Furthermore, the addition of image features from patients' MRI series resulted in an improvement in performance, with a lower test RMSE (0.4372 with multimodal vs 0.4581 with structured data). RealDiffFusionNet has shown promise in utilizing CDEs and multimodal data to accurately predict disease progression.</description>

      <title>Role of Noise in the Fairen-Velarde model of bacterial respiration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following our recent study (S. Kundu and M. Acharyya, International Journal of Modern Physics C, 35 (2024) 2450094), we have introduced stochasticity (random noise) in the Fairen-Velarde deterministic differential equations. The role of such noise on time scales is studied. The probability of reaching the domain of fixed points in a given interval is also calculated. The probability is studied as a function of the width of the noise, and a hyperbolic tangent fitting is proposed. The noise reduces the time scale for bringing the bacteria into an inactive state. The area of the fixed-point domain was found to be asympotically linear with noise. The time to reach the fixed-point domain is fitted to a Gaussian function with noise intensity.</description>

      <title>The ultimate issue error in scientific inference: mistaking parameters for hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference often conflates the probability of a parameter with the probability of a hypothesis, a critical misunderstanding termed the ultimate issue error. This error is pervasive across the social, biological, and medical sciences, where null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is mistakenly understood to be testing hypotheses rather than evaluating parameter estimates. Here, we advocate for using the Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach, which integrates quantitative data with qualitative background information for more accurate and transparent inference. Through a detailed example involving the relationship between vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) levels and COVID-19 risk, we demonstrate how WoE quantifies support for hypotheses while accounting for study design biases, power, and confounding factors. These findings emphasise the necessity of combining statistical metrics with contextual evaluation. This offers a structured framework to enhance reproducibility, reduce false interpretations, and foster robust scientific conclusions across disciplines.</description>

      <title>How Honeybees Perceive and Traverse Apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to fly through openings in vegetation allows insects like bees to access otherwise unreachable food sources. The specific visual strategies employed by flying insects during aperture negotiation tasks remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the visual and geometric parameters of apertures that influence honeybee flight. We recorded honeybees flying through apertures with varying shapes and sizes using high-speed cameras to examine their spatial distribution patterns and trajectories during passage. Our results reveal that the flight of bees was, on average, along the bilateral center of the edges of the aperture irrespective of the size. When apertures were smaller, bees tended to also fly closer to the vertical center. However, for larger apertures, they traverse at lower vertical positions (closer to the bottom edge). The behaviors suggest that honeybees modulate their flight trajectories in response to spatial constraints, adjusting trajectory relative to aperture dimensions. When entering at off-center horizontal positions, bees tended to access the vertical center of the aperture, indicating altitude selection influenced by the curvature of the edge below. This behavior suggests an acute awareness of the vertical and horizontal spatial constraints and a preference for maintaining a curvature-dependent altitude that optimizes safe passage. Our analysis reveals that honeybees modulate speed and altitude above the ventral edge passing beneath them, maintaining a median ventral optic flow of 778 deg/s. This relationship suggests a control mechanism where bees rely on visual information in a narrow ventrally directed field to navigate safely through confined spaces.</description>
