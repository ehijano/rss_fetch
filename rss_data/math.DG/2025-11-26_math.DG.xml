      <title>Quantitative Stability of the Clifford Torus as a Willmore Minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integral $2$-varifold $V\subset \mathbb{S}^3$ with square-integrable mean curvature, unit density, and support of genus at least $1$, assume that its Willmore energy satisfies \[ \mathcal{W}(V)\le 2\pi^2+\delta^2,\qquad \delta&lt;\delta_0\ll1. \] We show that the support $\Sigma=\operatorname{spt}V$ is, after applying a suitable conformal transformation of $\mathbb{S}^3$, quantitatively close to the Clifford torus. More precisely, under an appropriate conformal normalization, the surface $\Sigma$ admits a $W^{2,2}$ conformal parametrization by the flat torus whose conformal factor and metric coefficients differ from those of the Clifford torus by at most $C\delta$.</description>

      <title>On the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence for K\"{a}hler currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that if a holomorphic vector bundle is slope polystable with respect to a K\"{a}hler class, then it admits a Hermitian-Yang-Mills metric with respect to a suitable K\"{a}hler current with singularities in higher codimension which represents the K\"{a}hler class. Most parts of the proof remains valid for closed positive $(1,1)$-currents representing a nef and big class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short essay, we will survey on two conjectures in non-K\"ahler geometry: the constant holomorphic sectional curvature conjecture and the Fino-Vezzoni conjecture. We aim at the broad audience and assume no expertise in non-K\"ahler geometry. We will discuss the history and recent developments on these two typical conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Kodaira dimension of almost complex $4$-manifolds with torsion first Chern class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Kodaira dimension of almost complex $4$-manifolds with torsion first Chern class. First, we prove that, if the almost complex structure is also tamed, the only possible values for the Kodaira dimension are $0$ or $-\infty$. This is done by developing the theory of pseudoholomorphic structures on vector bundles. In arbitrary dimension, we study infinitesimal deformations of structures with pseudoholomorphically torsion canonical bundle. We compute their tangent space and, under suitable assumptions, we prove an unobstructedness theorem in the spirit of Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov. Together, our results allow to fully describe non-integrable infinitesimal deformations of complex structures on $K3$ and Enriques surfaces in terms of their Kodaira dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the full off-diagonal asymptotics of the equivariant and partial Bergman kernels associated with a circle action on a prequantized K\"ahler manifold with bounded geometry at infinity, then use these results to compute the asymptotics of the linear statistics of the associated determinantal point process as the number of points grows to infinity, showing that its distribution converges to a centered normal variable with variance given by the sum of an $H^1$-norm squared in the bulk and an $H^{1/2}$-norm squared on the boundary of the associated droplet.</description>

      <title>On the rigidity of special and exceptional geometries with torsion a closed $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that all Riemannian manifolds $(M, g, H)$ that admit a connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form $H$, which is both closed $d H=0$ and $\hat\nabla$-covariantly constant, are locally isometric to a product $N\times G$, where $G$ is a semisimple group and $N$ is a Riemannian manifold with $\iota_V H=0$ for all tangent vectors $V \in T_pN\subset T_pM$, $p\in M$. If $M$ is simply connected and complete, then by the de Rham theorem $M=N\times G$ globally. We use this to simplify the proof of similar results for strong KT, CYT and HKT manifolds that obey the above hypotheses and extend them to strong $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds with torsion. As an application, we describe the geometry of all complete and simply connected $G_2$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ manifolds whose torsion satisfies the above conditions.
  We also demonstrate that all compact 8-dimensional manifolds with strong HKT structure are locally isometric to one of the following: 8-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler; $SU(3)$ equipped with the bi-invariant metric and 3-form; or the product $(U(1)\times SU(2))\times B^4$, where $B^4$ is either a hyper-K\"ahler manifold or $U(1)\times SU(2)$ equipped with an HKT structure.</description>

      <title>Morse index stability for p-Yang-Mills connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the lower semi continuity of the Morse index and the upper continuity of the Morse Index plus nullity of sequences of critical points of the Sacks-Uhlenbeck type relaxation of the Yang-Mills Energy in 4 dimension. The result is known not to be true in general for the ``cousin problem'' of hamonic maps from surfaces into arbitrary manifolds. This result is stressing the more stable behaviour of Yang-Mills Fields compare to harmonic maps as observed in other contexts such as the flow. The Morse Index control at the limit of critical points to Sacks Uhlenbeck relaxations of Yang-Mills Lagrangian is a central result in the implementation of minmax operation on this Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Index invariants and Eta invariants determine Differential KO theory in degrees that are multiples of 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sullivan--Simons developed a Cheeger--Simons differential character analogue for degree (0 mod 2) differential K-theory, giving a complete set of numerical invariants that determine a complex vector bundle with unitary connection on a base manifold X, up to Chern--Simons equivalence of the connection. In this paper we develop a degree (0 mod 8) differential KO-analogue. Namely, given a real vector bundle with orthogonal connection, we construct R/Z -valued eta-invariants in the context of Atiyah--Patodi--Singer and Z2 Atiyah--Singer index invariants that completely determine differential KO-theory in degree (0 mod 8); we call this the differential KO-character. In the second part, for a Riemannian submersion X to B with closed 8k-dimensional spin fibers, we develop two family index theorems in differential KO -theory: one in the differential KO -character model and one in the structured-bundle model. The fact that these two pushforwards agree follows from the Bismut--Cheeger adiabatic limit theorem, providing a new interpretation of that result.</description>

      <title>A Calder\'on Problem for the Dirac operator with chiral boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider on a spin manifold with boundary a Dirac operator $D_A$ with chiral boundary conditions, twisted by a unitary connection $A$. When $m$ is not in the chiral spectrum of $D_A$, we define an analogue of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Dirac equation $D_A - m$, which we call the boundary conjugation map, and show that it is a pseudodifferential operator of order $0$ on the boundary. We show that in dimension greater than 2, its symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric and connection modulo gauge on the boundary when $m \neq 0$ and $m^2$ is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of $D_A^2$. We go on to show that a real-analytic Riemannian manifold and twisted spinor bundle with twisted spin connection can be recovered from its boundary conjugation map. Under further hypotheses, one can recover the unitary connection up to global gauge equivalence and the complex spinor bundles. Similar results hold in dimension $2$ when the auxiliary bundle and connection are absent.</description>

      <title>A Presymplectic and Symmetry Reduced Formulation of the Maxwell Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric formulation of the Maxwell-Vlasov system using the infinite-dimensional Skinner-Rusk (SR) formalism. In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay--Nester--Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism.
  Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler--Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden--Weinstein/Morrison--Greene Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy--Casimir method.
  Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie--Poisson equations for plasma--antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing. The resulting picture provides a single presymplectic structure that unifies Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, gauge, reduction, and control-theoretic aspects of the Maxwell-Vlasov system.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

Abstract: We prove for the first time a pointwise lower estimate of the normal injectivity radius of an embedded hypersurface in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold. Main applications include: (i) a pointwise lower estimate of the graphing radius of a properly embedded hypersurface; (ii) the construction of metrics of bounded geometry on arbitrary manifolds with boundary; (iii) the equivalence of the classical (topological) notion of orientation with that of the geometric notion (in the sense of metric measure spaces) on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds with boundary. In addition, we prove that every manifold with boundary admits a metric with bounded geometry such that the boundary becomes convex. This result strengthens the justification of a recent notion of orientation on finite dimensional RCD spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of the ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds inspired by the definition of mass for weakly regular asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds by Gicquaud and Sakovich. This version of the mass allows one to work with metrics of local Sobolev regularity $ W^{1,2}_\text{loc} \cap L^\infty $ and we show, under suitable asymptotic assumptions, that the mass is finite, invariant under a change of coordinates at infinity and that it agrees with the classical ADM mass in the smooth setting. We also provide an expression in terms of the Ricci tensor that agrees with the Ricci version of the ADM mass studied by Herzlich.</description>

Abstract: We consider fill-ins of spin manifolds with scalar curvature bounded by $-n(n-1)$. Gromov proposed a conjecture relating the infimum of the mean curvature of such a fill-in to the hyperspherical radius. We observe that the inequality conjectured by Gromov follows by combining an inequality of Hijazi-Montiel-Rold\'an for the first Dirac eigenvalue with a recent theorem of B\"ar. Moreover, we give an alternative proof of the Hijazi-Montiel-Rold\'an inequality based on the work of B\"ar and B\"ar-Ballmann.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Serre-Swan theorem asserts that any finitely generated projective module over the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions of a manifold $M$ can be realized as the sections of a vector bundle over $M$. In this article, we extend this theorem beyond the projective case by introducing a notion of singular vector bundle whose sections can realize all finitely generated $C^\infty(M)$-modules, up to invisible elements. We introduce tepui fibrations as the underlying geometric objects of these singular vector bundles, and show how these tepui fibrations can model singular foliations, their holonomy groupoids, and singular subalgebroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl geometry is a natural extension of conformal geometry with Weyl covariance mediated by a Weyl connection. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal manifolds to a corresponding construction for Weyl manifolds. We first introduce the Weyl-ambient metric motivated by the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham (WFG) gauge. From a top-down perspective, we show that the Weyl-ambient space as a pseudo-Riemannian geometry induces a codimension-2 Weyl geometry. Then, from a bottom-up perspective, we start from promoting a conformal manifold into a Weyl manifold by assigning a Weyl connection to the principal $\mathbb{R}_+$-bundle realizing a Weyl structure. We show that the Weyl structure admits a well-defined initial value problem, which determines the Weyl-ambient metric. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we also investigate Weyl-covariant tensors on the Weyl manifold and define extended Weyl-obstruction tensors explicitly.</description>

Abstract: We construct the first explicit non-trivial example of deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills (dHYM) connection on a higher rank slope-unstable holomorphic vector bundle over a Fano threefold. Additionally, we provide a sufficient algebraic condition in terms of central charges for the existence of dHYM connections on Whitney sum of holomorphic line bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. As a consequence, we obtain several new examples of dHYM connections on higher rank holomorphic vector bundles.</description>
