      <title>Refined Absorption: A New Proof of the Existence Conjecture and its Applications to Extremal and Probabilistic Design Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the recently developed method of refined absorption and how it is used to provide a new proof of the Existence Conjecture for combinatorial designs. This method can also be applied to resolve open problems in extremal and probabilistic design theory while providing a unified framework for these problems. Crucially, the main absorption theorem can be used as a "black-box" in these applications obviating the need to reprove the absorption step for each different setup.</description>

      <title>An inverse and a stability result for Ruzsa's inequality on triple sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruzsa's inequality states that $|A+A+A| \leq |A+A|^{3/2}$ for any finite set $A$ in a commutative group. Ruzsa has constructed examples showing that this inequality is sharp asymptotically, up to a constant factor. We prove an inverse result which says that if $|A+A+A| \geq \frac{1}{M} |A+A|^{3/2}$ for some parameter $M,$ then the set $A$ resembles the sets in Ruzsa's construction. We then construct more families of examples which suggest that our inverse result is likely best possible qualitatively. The method extends to give an inverse result for a higher sumset analogue of Ruzsa's inequality, namely $|(h+1)A| \leq |hA|^{\frac{h+1}{h}}$ for any $h\geq 2.$ We also provide a "99%-stability" version of Ruzsa's inequality, which describes near optimal structures when $M$ is very close to $1.$</description>

      <title>Point-Line Incidence Estimates in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The point-line incidence problem has been widely studied in Euclidean spaces and vector spaces over finite fields, whereas the analogous problem has rarely been considered over finite $p$-adic rings. In this paper, we investigate incidences in the $p$-adic setting and prove new incidence bounds for points and lines in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^2$. Our first two results extend previously known incidence bounds over finite fields, assuming lines are well-separated. For non-separated lines, we establish a general incidence result for weighted points and lines under certain dimensional spacing conditions using the Fourier analytic method and the induction-on-scales argument.</description>

      <title>A Linear Representation for Functions on Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any function $f$ from a finite set $Y$ to itself can be represented linearly. Specifically, we prove the existence of an injective map $j$ from $Y$ into a modular ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ and a constant $a \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that the relation $j(f(y)) = a \cdot j(y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ holds for all $y \in Y$. This result is established by analyzing the algebraic properties of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix associated with the function's digraph. The proof is constructive, providing a method for finding the embedding $j$, the modulus $m$, and the linear multiplier $a$.</description>

      <title>Boundary vertices of Strongly Connected Digraphs with respect to `Sum Metric'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $D = (V, E)$ is a strongly connected digraph and $u, v \in V (D)$. Among the many metrics in graphs, the sum metric warrants further exploration. The sum distance $sd(u, v)$ defined as $sd(u, v) =\overrightarrow{d}(u, v)+\overrightarrow{d}(v, u)$ is a metric where $\overrightarrow{d}(u, v)$ denotes the length of the shortest directed $u - v$ path in $D$. The four main boundary vertices in the digraphs are ``boundary vertices, contour vertices, eccentric vertices'', and ``peripheral vertices'' and their relationships have been studied. Also, an attempt is made to study the boundary-type sets of corona product of (di)graphs. The center of the corona product of two strongly connected digraphs is established. All the boundary-type sets and the center of the corona product are established in terms of factor digraphs.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and Hilton-Milner type theorem for $k$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-partition of an $n$-set $X$ is a collection of $k$ pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets whose union is $X$. A family of $k$-partitions of $X$ is called $t$-intersecting if any two of its members share at least $t$ blocks. A $t$-intersecting family is trivial if every $k$-partition in it contains $t$ fixed blocks, and is non-trivial otherwise. In this paper, we first prove that, for $n\geq L(k,t):=(t+1)+(k-t+1)\cdot\log_2(t+1)(k-t+1)$, a $t$-intersecting family with maximum size must consist of all $k$-partitions containing $t$ fixed singletons. This improves the results given by Erd\H{o}s and Sz\H{e}kely (2000), and by Kupavskii (2023). We further determine the non-trivial $t$-intersecting families of $k$-partitions with maximum size for $n \ge 2L(k,t)$, which turn out to be natural analogs of the corresponding families for finite sets. In addition, we prove a stability result.</description>

      <title>Probability model of edge-fault tolerance for regular graphs with respect to edge connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the probability model of edge-fault tolerance of a network in the sense of connectivity with link faults. Using graph-theoretical notation, we define the edge-fault (EF) and Menger-type edge-fault (MEF) tolerances of a graph as the probabilities that the graph is connected and strongly Menger edge-connected when each edge has a certain failure probability, respectively. We derive an upper bound on the EF tolerance for regular graphs, which reveals an asymptotical behavior when graphs and edge failure probability are large enough. We also perform a simulation experiment on a number of randomly generated regular graphs and some typically well-used graphs. The numerical results show that, in addition to their well-structured properties for networks, Hypercubes, M\"{o}bius Cubes, Ary-Cubes and Circulant graphs have also higher EF and MEF tolerance in general. In particular, the M\"{o}bius Cube has both the highest EF and MEF tolerance among all involved graphs. The numerical results also hint that, in contrast to MEF tolerance, the EF tolerance of regular graphs is not strongly effected by the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Convexity of Neural Codes with Four Maximal Codewords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Place cells are neurons that act as biological position sensors, associated with and firing in response to regions of an environment to situate an organism in space. These associations are recorded in (combinatorial) neural codes, motivating the following mathematical question: Which neural codes are generated by a collection of convex open sets in Euclidean space? Giusti and Itskov showed that a necessary condition for convexity is the absence of ``local obstructions." This necessary condition is, in fact, sufficient for certain families of codes. One such family consists of all codes with up to three maximal codewords. In this article, we investigate codes with four maximal codewords, showing that for many such codes, convexity is characterized by the absence of local obstructions, whereas for other such codes, convexity is characterized by the absence of local obstructions and a second type of obstruction, a ``wheel". Key to our analysis is a case-by-case investigation based on the nerve complex of the set of maximal codewords of a neural code. Up to symmetry, there are 20 possible nerves; and our results fully characterize convexity in 15 of the 20 cases.</description>

      <title>Total perfect codes in Cayley sum graphs of cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Cayley sum graphs over the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and aim to explore several necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of total perfect codes in these graphs. Specifically, we examine various cases for the connection set of the graph including when it is periodic, aperiodic, or square-free. To this end, we utilize a correspondence that we first establish between total perfect codes and factorizations of groups, along with their algebraic properties. We then generalize some of these conditions to the direct product of cyclic groups, i.e. $\mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{n_d}$.</description>

      <title>Perfect difference families, perfect systems of difference sets and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $v$ be a positive odd integer. A $(v,k,\lambda)$-perfect difference family (PDF) is a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-subsets of $\{0,1,\ldots,v-1\}$ such that the multiset $\bigcup_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\{x-y : x,y\in F, x&gt;y\}$ covers each element of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,(v-1)/2\right\}$ exactly $\lambda$ times. Perfect difference families are a special class of perfect systems of difference sets. They were introduced by Bermond, Kotzig, and Turgeon in the 1970s, following a problem suggested by Erd\H{o}s. In this paper, we prove that a $(v,4,\lambda)$-PDF exists if and only if $\lambda(v-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{12}$, $v \geq 13$, and $(v,\lambda) \notin \{(25,1),(37,1)\}$. This result resolves a nearly 50-year-old conjecture posed by Bermond. Perfect difference families find applications in radio astronomy, optical orthogonal codes for optical code-division multiple access systems, geometric orthogonal codes for DNA origami, difference triangle sets, additive sequences of permutations, and graceful graph labelings.
  To establish our main result, we introduce a new concept termed a layered difference family. This concept provides a powerful and unified perspective that not only facilitates our proof of the main theorem but also simplifies recent existence proofs for various cyclic difference packings.</description>

      <title>Higher Order r-Dowling polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ordered set partition, when one insert a number of bars in-between the blocks of the ordered set partition the result is a barred preferential arrangement.
  In this study, using the notion of barred preferential arrangements we propose a combinatorial interpretation of a type of generalized Bell polynomials. We also define a new higher order generalization of the $r$-Dowling polynomials. We discuss its degenerate and non degenerate versions. Using the notion of barred preferential arrangements we provide a combinatorial interpretation of these higher order $r$-Dowling polynomials. Furthermore, we prove several combinatorial identities on these polynomials. We also provide some integral representations of these polynomials, and provide some of their asymptotic results. We also show several closed form expressions demonstrating how these higher order $r$-Dowling polynomials may be expressed in terms of Bell polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Geometric Bipartite Graphs with Asymptotically Smallest Zarankiewicz Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the \textit{Zarankiewicz problem} in graphs with low-dimensional geometric representation (i.e., low Ferrers dimension). Our first result reveals a separation between bipartite graphs of Ferrers dimension three and four: while $Z(n;k) \leq 9n(k-1)$ for graphs of Ferrers dimension three, $Z(n;k) \in \Omega\left(n k \cdot \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$ for Ferrers dimension four graphs (Chan &amp; Har-Peled, 2023) (Chazelle, 1990). To complement this, we derive a tight upper bound of $2n(k-1)$ for chordal bigraphs and $54n(k-1)$ for grid intersection graphs (GIG), a prominent graph class residing in four Ferrers dimensions and capturing planar bipartite graphs as well as bipartite intersection graphs of rectangles. Previously, the best-known bound for GIG was $Z(n;k) \in O(2^{O(k)} n)$, implied by the results of Fox &amp; Pach (2006) and Mustafa &amp; Pach (2016). Our results advance and offer new insights into the interplay between Ferrers dimensions and extremal combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: Ferrer dimension, along with the order dimension, is a standard dimensional concept for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we prove that a graph is of Ferrer dimension three (equivalent to the intersection bigraph of orthants and points in ${\mathbb R}^3$) if and only if it admits a biadjacency matrix representation that does not contain $\Gamma= \begin{bmatrix} * &amp; 1 &amp; * \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; * \end{bmatrix}$ and $\Delta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; * &amp; * \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; * \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}$, where $*$ denotes zero or one entry.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Kim-Vu sandwich conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2004, Kim and Vu conjectured that, when $d=\omega(\log n)$, the random $d$-regular graph $G_d(n)$ can be sandwiched with high probability between two random binomial graphs $G(n,p)$ with edge probabilities asymptotically equal to $\frac{d}{n}$. That is, there should exist $p_*=(1-o(1))\frac{d}{n}$, $p^*=(1+o(1))\frac{d}{n}$ and a coupling $(G_*,G,G^*)$ such that $G_*\sim G(n,p_*)$, $G\sim G_d(n)$, $G^*\sim G(n,p^*)$, and $\mathbb{P}(G_*\subset G\subset G^*)=1-o(1)$. Known as the sandwich conjecture, such a coupling is desirable as it would allow properties of the random regular graph to be inferred from those of the more easily studied binomial random graph. The conjecture was recently shown to be true when $d\gg\log^4n$ by Gao, Isaev and McKay. In this paper, we prove the sandwich conjecture in full. We do so by analysing a natural coupling procedure introduced in earlier work by Gao, Isaev and McKay, which had only previously been done when $d\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$.</description>

      <title>A Tverberg-type problem of Kalai: Two negative answers to questions of Alon and Smorodinsky, and the power of disjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote the least integer $n$ such that every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a partition $P=P_1\cup\cdots\cup P_r$ with the property that for any choice of $s_i$-convex sets $C_i\supseteq P_i$ $(i\in[r])$ one necessarily has $\bigcap_{i=1}^r C_i\neq\emptyset$, where an $s_i$-convex set means a union of $s_i$ convex sets. A recent breakthrough by Alon and Smorodinsky establishes a general upper bound $f_r(d,s_1,\dots,s_r) = O(dr^2\log r \prod_{i=1}^r s_i\cdot \log(\prod_{i=1}^r s_i).$ Specializing to $r=2$ resolves the problem of Kalai from the 1970s. They further singled out two particularly intriguing questions: whether $f_{2}(2,s,s)$ can be improved from $O(s^2\log s)$ to $O(s)$, and whether $f_r(d,s,\ldots,s)\le Poly(r,d,s)$. We answer both in the negative by showing the exponential lower bound $f_{r}(d,s,\ldots,s)&gt; s^{r}$ for any $r\ge 2$, $s\ge 1$ and $d\ge 2r-2$, which matches the upper bound up to a multiplicative $\log{s}$ factor for sufficiently large $s$. Our construction combines a scalloped planar configuration with a direct product of regular $s$-gon on the high-dimensional torus $(\mathbb{S}^1)^{r-2}$. Perhaps surprisingly, if we additionally require that within each block the $s_i$ convex sets are pairwise disjoint, the picture changes markedly. Let $F_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote this disjoint-union variant of the extremal function. We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\log s)$ by performing controlled planar geometric transformations and constructing an auxiliary graph whose planarity yields the upper bound; (2) when $s$ is large, $F_r(d,s,\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by $O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\log r\cdot s^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the geometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a variant of the Erd\H{o}s box problem.</description>

      <title>Mixing time and isoperimetry in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixing time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs generated by the unit intensity Poisson Point Process in a $d$-dimensional cube of volume $n$. With $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and any $r \ge (1+\epsilon)r_g$, the mixing time of the giant component is with high probability $\Theta(n^{2/d}/r^{2})$, thereby closing a gap in the literature. The main tool is an isoperimetric inequality which holds, w.h.p., for any large enough vertex set, a result which we believe is of independent interest. Our analysis also implies that the relaxation time is of the same order.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to majority optimality in NICD with erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We asked GPT-5 Pro to look for counterexamples among a public list of open problems (the Simons ``Real Analysis in Computer Science'' collection). After several numerical experiments, it suggested a counterexample for the Non-Interactive Correlation Distillation (NICD) with erasures question: namely, a Boolean function on 5 bits that achieves a strictly larger value of $\mathbb{E}|f(z)|$ than the 5-bit majority function when the erasure parameter is $p=0.40.$ In this very short note we record the finding, state the problem precisely, give the explicit function, and verify the computation step by step by hand so that it can be checked without a computer. In addition, we show that for each fixed odd $n$ the majority is optimal (among unbiased Boolean functions) in a neighborhood of $p=0$. We view this as a little spark of an AI contribution in Theoretical Computer Science: while modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often assist with literature and numerics, here a concrete finite counterexample emerged.</description>

      <title>Labeling and folding multi-labeled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1989 Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely showed that there is a bijection between (i) the set of rooted trees with $n+1$ vertices whose leaves are bijectively labeled with the elements of $[\ell]=\{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ for some $\ell \leq n$, and (ii) the set of partitions of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. They established this via a labeling algorithm based on the anti-lexicographic ordering of non-empty subsets of $[n]$ which extends the labeling of the leaves of a given tree to a labeling of all of the vertices of that tree. In this paper, we generalize their approach by developing a labeling algorithm for multi-labeled trees, that is, rooted trees whose leaves are labeled by positive integers but in which distinct leaves may have the same label. In particular, we show that certain orderings of the set of all finite, non-empty multisets of positive integers can be used to characterize partitions of a multiset that arise from labelings of multi-labeled trees. As an application, we show that the recently introduced class of labelable phylogenetic networks is precisely the class of phylogenetic networks that are stable relative to the so-called folding process on multi-labeled trees. We also give a bijection between the labelable phylogenetic networks with leaf-set $[n]$ and certain partitions of multisets.</description>

      <title>Excluding a Line Minor via Design Matrices and Column Number Bounds for the Circuit Imbalance Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a real matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ with non-collinear columns, we show that $n \leq O(d^4 \kappa_A)$ where $\kappa_A$ is the \emph{circuit imbalance measure} of $A$. The circuit imbalance measure $\kappa$ is a real analogue of $\Delta$-modularity for integer matrices, satisfying $\kappa_A \leq \Delta_A$ for integer $A$. The circuit imbalance measure has numerous applications in the context of linear programming (see Ekbatani, Natura and V{\'e}gh (2022) for a survey). Our result generalizes the $O(d^4 \Delta_A)$ bound of Averkov and Schymura (2023) for integer matrices and provides the first polynomial bound holding for all parameter ranges on real matrices.
  To derive our result, similar to the strategy of Geelen, Nelson and Walsh (2021) for $\Delta$-modular matrices, we show that real representable matroids induced by $\kappa$-bounded matrices are minor closed and exclude a rank $2$ uniform matroid on $O(\kappa)$ elements as a minor (also known as a line of length $O(\kappa)$).
  As our main technical contribution, we show that any simple rank $d$ complex representable matroid which excludes a line of length $l$ has at most $O(d^4 l)$ elements. This complements the tight bound of $(l-3)\binom{d}{2} + d$ for $l \geq 4$, of Geelen, Nelson and Walsh which holds when the rank $d$ is sufficiently large compared to $l$ (at least doubly exponential in $l$).</description>

      <title>Laplacian Spectrum and Domination in Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite simple undirected graph $G$, let $\gamma(G)$ denote the size of a smallest dominating set of $G$ and $\mu(G)$ denote the number of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of $G$ in the interval $[0,1)$, counting multiplicities. Hedetniemi, Jacobs and Trevisan [Eur. J. Comb. 2016] showed that for any graph $G$, $\mu(G) \leqslant \gamma(G)$. Cardoso, Jacobs and Trevisan [Graphs Combin. 2017] asks whether the ratio $\gamma(T)/\mu(T)$ is bounded by a constant for all trees $T$. We answer this question by showing that this ratio is less than $4/3$ for every tree. We establish the optimality of this bound by constructing an infinite family of trees where this ratio approaches $4/3$. We also improve this upper bound for trees in which all the vertices other than leaves and their parents have degree at least $k$, for every $k \geqslant 3$. We show that, for such trees $T$, $\gamma(T)/\mu(T) &lt; 1 + 1/((k-2)(k+1))$.</description>

      <title>The Davenport constant of balls and boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an additively written abelian group $G$ and a set $X\subseteq G$, we let $\mathsf{D}(X)$ denote the Davenport constant of $X$, namely the largest non-negative integer $n$ for which there exists a sequence $x_1, \dots, x_n$ of elements of $X$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i =0$ and $\sum_{i \in I} x_i \ne 0$ for each non-empty proper subset $I$ of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. In this paper, we mainly investigate the case when $G$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$, and $X$ is a discrete Euclidean ball. An application to the classical problem of estimating the Davenport constant of a box - a product of intervals of integers - is then obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inversion statistic of random permutations under the family~$(\p_\theta)_{\theta \ge 0}$ of Ewens sampling distributions on~$S_n$. We obtain an exact formula for the expected number of inversions under~$\p_\theta$. In particular, we show that this expected number of inversions is decreasing in the tilting parameter~$\theta$ and that it is convex in~$\theta$ for~$n \ge 5$ only. Further, we derive an exact formula for the probability that a specific pair of indices~$(i,j) \in \{1,\dots,n\}^2$ is inverted and show that this probability is decreasing in~$\theta$ if and only if~$\abs j-i\abs \ge 2$ holds.</description>

      <title>Incomplete U-Statistics of Equireplicate Designs: Berry-Esseen Bound and Efficient Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the main analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy. By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound that applies to all incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be established even in the degenerate case and when the order diverges. We also introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain cases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to kernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. In a real data example with CIFAR-10, our permutation-free MMD test delivers substantial computational gains while retaining power and type I error control.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Long-Refinement Graphs for Colour Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Colour Refinement algorithm is a classical procedure to detect symmetries in graphs, whose most prominent application is in graph-isomorphism tests. The algorithm and its generalisation, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, evaluate local information to compute a colouring for the vertices in an iterative fashion. Different final colours of two vertices certify that no isomorphism can map one onto the other. The number of iterations that the algorithm takes to terminate is its central complexity parameter. For a long time, it was open whether graphs that take the maximum theoretically possible number of Colour Refinement iterations actually exist. Starting from an exhaustive search on graphs of low degrees, Kiefer and McKay proved the existence of infinite families of such long-refinement graphs with degrees 2 and 3, thereby showing that the trivial upper bound on the iteration number of Colour Refinement is tight. In this work, we provide a complete characterisation of the long-refinement graphs with low (or, equivalently, high) degrees. We show that, with one exception, the aforementioned families are the only long-refinement graphs with maximum degree at most 3, and we fully classify the long-refinement graphs with maximum degree 4. To this end, via a reverse-engineering approach, we show that all low-degree long-refinement graphs can be represented as compact strings, and we derive multiple structural insights from this surprising fact. Since long-refinement graphs are closed under taking edge complements, this also yields a classification of long-refinement graphs with high degrees. Kiefer and McKay initiated a search for long-refinement graphs that are only distinguished in the last iteration of Colour Refinement before termination. We conclude it in this submission by showing that such graphs cannot exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1808.06095 we have introduced the Knuth class of the word recording a sequence of locations for repeated internal insertion operations in the Sagan-Stanley skew RSK correspondence, with no prescribed external insertion of new cells, to be a preserver for the $P$-tableau. As a consequence the Benkart-Sottile-Stroomer switching involution on ballot tableau pairs allows a realization as a recursive internal insertion procedure. This amounts to explain the various presentations of Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters and their coincidence predicted by Pak and Vallejo with contributions by Danilov and Koshevoi. In particular, the aforesaid presentation provides internal insertion as an alternative to Sch\"utzenberger- Lusztig involution (or evacuation) to constructing the Gelfand-Tsetlin pair in the Henriques-Kamnitzer $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-crystal commuter. In addition, the coincidence of LR commuters solves the Lecouvey-Lenart conjecture, recently further developed by Kumar-Torres, on bijections between the Kwon and Sundaram branching models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following generalisation of permutation networks. We say a sequence $T=(T_1,\dots,T_\ell)$ of transpositions in $S_n$ forms a $t$-reachability network if, for every choice of $t$ distinct points $x_1, \dots, x_t\in \{1,\dots,n\}$, there is a subsequence of $T$ whose composition maps $j$ to $x_j$ for every $1\leq j\leq t$. When $t=n$, any permutation in $S_n$ can be created and $T$ is a permutation network. Waksman [JACM, 1968] showed that the shortest permutation networks have length about $n \log_2(n)$. In this paper, we investigate the shortest $t$-reachability networks for other values of $t$. Our main result settles the case of $t=2$: the shortest $2$-reachability network has length $\lceil 3n/2\rceil-2 $. For fixed $t \geq 3$, we give a simple randomised construction which shows that there exist $t$-reachability networks with $(2+o_t(1))n$ transpositions. We also study the effect of restricting to star-transpositions, i.e. restricting all transpositions to have the form $(1, \cdot)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute a triangulation of certain faces of the submodular cone. More precisely, graphical zonotopes are generalized permutahedra, and hence their deformation cones are faces of the submodular cone. We give a triangulation of these faces for graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 4 vertices. We deduce the rays of these faces: Minkowski indecomposable deformations of these graphical zonotopes are segments and triangles.
  Besides, computer experiments lead to examples of graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 5 vertices, whose graphical zonotopes have high dimensional Minkowski indecomposable deformations.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes $Q_{n,2}$ with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrates on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083\%$ of values where $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds of $h$ mentioned above are both tight.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs with uniform Tur\'an density equal to 8/27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os initiated the study of Tur\'an problems with a uniformity condition on the distribution of edges: the uniform Tur\'an density of a hypergraph $H$ is the infimum over all $d$ for which any sufficiently large hypergraph with the property that all its linear-size subhypergraphs have density at least $d$ contains $H$. In particular, they asked to determine the uniform Tur\'an densities of $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved in [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter still remains open. Till today, there are known constructions of 3-uniform hypergraphs with uniform Tur\'an density equal to 0, 1/27, 4/27 and 1/4 only. We extend this list by a fifth value: we prove an easy to verify condition for the uniform Tur\'an density to be equal to 8/27 and identify hypergraphs satisfying this condition.</description>

      <title>Vertices of the monotone path polytopes of hypersimplicies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monotone path polytope of a polytope $P$ encapsulates the combinatorial behavior of the shadow vertex rule (a pivot rule used in linear programming) on $P$. Computing monotone path polytopes is the entry door to the larger subject of fiber polytopes, for which explicitly computing examples remains a challenge. We first give a detailed presentation on how to construct monotone path polytopes.
  Monotone path polytopes of cubes and simplices have been known since the seminal article of Billera and Sturmfels. We extend these results to hypersimplices by linking this problem to the combinatorics of lattice paths. Indeed, we give a combinatorial model which describes the vertices of the monotone path polytope of the hypersimplex $\Delta(n, 2)$ (for any generic direction). With this model, we give a precise count of these vertices, and furthermore count the number of coherent monotone paths on $\Delta(n, 2)$ according to their lengths.
  We prove that some of the results obtained also hold for hypersimplices $\Delta(n, k)$ for $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that products of double Grothendieck polynomials have the same back- and forward-stability numbers as products of Schubert polynomials, characterize which simple reflections appear in such products, and also give a new proof of a finiteness conjecture of Lam-Lee-Shimozono on products of back-stable Grothendieck polynomials which was first proved by Anderson. To do this, we use the main theorems from our recent work, as well as expansion formulas of Lenart, Fomin-Kirillov, and Lam-Lee-Shimozono.</description>

      <title>Catching Rats in $H$-minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $H$-minor-free graph that also excludes a $(k \times k)$-grid as a minor has treewidth/branchwidth bounded from above by a function $f(t,k)$ that is linear in $k$ and polynomial in $t := |V(H)|$. Such a result was proven originally by [Demaine &amp; Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$ was indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was non-explicit (and huge). Later, [Kawarabayashi &amp; Kobayashi, JCTB, 2020] showed that this bound can be estimated to be $f(t,k)\in 2^{\mathcal{O}(t\log t)} \cdot k$. Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be polynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$. We answer this in a particularly strong sense, by showing that the treewidth/branchwidth of $G$ is in $\mathcal{O}(gk + t^{2304}),$ where $g$ is the Euler genus of $H$. This directly yields $f(t,k)= \mathcal{O}(t^2k + t^{2304})$.
  Our methods build on techniques for branchwidth and on new bounds and insights for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem (GMST) due to [Gorsky, Seweryn &amp; Wiederrecht, 2025, arXiv:2504.02532]. In particular, we prove a variant of the GMST that ensures some helpful properties for the minor relation. We further employ our methods to provide approximation algorithms for the treewidth/branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and every $t$-vertex graph $H$ with Euler genus $g$, we give a $(g + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs running in $2^{\mathsf{poly}(t) / \varepsilon} \cdot \mathsf{poly}(n)$-time. Our algorithms explicitly return either an appropriate branch-decomposition or a grid-minor certifying a negative answer.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for Interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Knop and Sahi introduced a remarkable family of inhomogeneous symmetric polynomials, defined via vanishing conditions, whose top homogeneous parts are exactly the Macdonald polynomials. Like the Macdonald polynomials, these interpolation Macdonald polynomials are closely connected to the Hecke algebra, and admit nonsymmetric versions, which generalize the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. In this paper we give a combinatorial formula for interpolation Macdonald polynomials in terms of signed multiline queues; this formula generalizes the combinatorial formula for Macdonald polynomials in terms of multiline queues given by Corteel-Mandelshtam-Williams.</description>

      <title>Many rays of the submodular cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the cone of submodular functions goes back to Jack Edmonds' seminal 1970 paper, which already highlighted the difficulty of characterizing its extreme rays. Since then, researchers from diverse fields have sought to characterize, enumerate, and bound the number of such rays. In this paper, we introduce an inductive construction that generates new rays of the submodular cone. This allows us to establish that the $n$-th submodular cone has at least $2^{2^{n-2}}$ rays, which improves upon the lower bound obtained from Hien Q. Nguyen's 1986 characterization of indecomposable matroid polytopes by a factor of order $\sqrt{n^3}$ in the exponent.</description>

      <title>An AI enhanced approach to the tree unimodality conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, its independence sequence is the integral sequence $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets of vertices of size i. In the late 80's Alavi, Erdos, Malde, Schwenk showed that this sequence need not be unimodal for general graphs, but conjectured that it is always unimodal whenever $G$ is a tree. This conjecture was then naturally generalized to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave, in the sense that $a_i^2$ is always above $a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$. This conjecture stood for many years, until in 2023, Kadrawi, Levit, Yosef, and Mizrachi proved that there were exactly two trees on 26 vertices whose independence sequence was not log concave. In this paper, we use the AI architecture PatternBoost, developed by Charton, Ellenberg, Wagner, and Williamson to train a machine to find counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture. We will discuss the successes of this approach - finding tens of thousands of new counter-examples to log-concavity with vertex set sizes varying from 27 to 101 - and some of its fascinating failures.</description>

      <title>Word Measures on Wreath Products II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been noticed since around 2007 that certain enumeration problems can be solved when an analytic or algebraic curve is identified. This curve is the key to the problem. In these lectures, a few such examples are presented. One is a detailed account on counting simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering this key curve. The formula for the curve allows us to write the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers in terms of polynomials. This unexpected polynomiality produces, as a byproduct, straightforward and short proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous enumeration problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The asymptotic behavior of counting leads this time to the Euler characteristic of the moduli spaces of smooth curves. We then discuss another enumeration problem, the Ap\'ery sequences. The quest of identifying the hidden curve for this case remains open.
  These curves, also known as spectral curves, are discovered via solving ordinary differential equations. The counting problem of geometric origin associated with the genus 0, one marked point case is encoded in the spectral curve. It is explained that going from the $(g,n)=(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$ is a process of quantization of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations are linear with holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <title>Depth-Bounds for Neural Networks via the Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.</description>

      <title>Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can algebraic geometry enhance the sharpness, robustness, and interpretability of modern neural reasoning models by equipping them with a mathematically grounded inductive bias? To answer this, we introduce Tropical Attention, an attention mechanism grounded in tropical geometry that lifts the attention kernel into tropical projective space, where reasoning is piecewise-linear and 1-Lipschitz, thus preserving the polyhedral decision structure inherent to combinatorial reasoning. We prove that Multi-Head Tropical Attention (MHTA) stacks universally approximate tropical circuits and realize tropical transitive closure through composition, achieving polynomial resource bounds without invoking recurrent mechanisms. These guarantees explain why the induced polyhedral decision boundaries remain sharp and scale-invariant, rather than smoothed by Softmax. Empirically, we show that Tropical Attention delivers stronger out-of-distribution generalization in both length and value, with high robustness against perturbative noise, and substantially faster inference with fewer parameters compared to Softmax-based and recurrent attention baselines. For the first time, we extend neural algorithmic reasoning beyond PTIME problems to NP-hard and NP-complete problems, paving the way toward sharper and more expressive Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) capable of tackling complex combinatorial challenges in phylogenetics, cryptography, particle physics, and mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>Scattered Behavior Using Modified Cyclotomic Mapping Over Finite Fields Of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced by Sheekey in 2016, the study of scattered polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ has been increasing regarding the classification of those that are exceptional, i.e., polynomials which are scattered over infinite field extensions, are limited to the cases where their index $t$ is small, or a prime number larger than the q-degree k of the polynomial, or an integer smaller than k in the case where k is a prime. In this paper, we focus on the scattered behavior of $S(x)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix^{q^{r_i}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime, $0&lt;r_1&lt;r_2&lt; \cdots&lt;r_k&lt;n$ and $a_1, \cdots,a_k \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that the order of $a_i$'s divide $(q^{r_1}-1)$, $\forall i=2,3,\cdots,k $. We explore a connection between $S(x)$ and the cyclotomic mapping polynomial. As an application, in three parts, we discuss the scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $t$ where $t=r_1$, or $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$, or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. Starting with the pseudoregulus type of index $t \geq 0$, we present conditions to verify scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $r_1$. With some additional conditions, we do the same in case $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$ or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. In particular, for $S(x)=a_1x^{q^{r_1}}+a_2x^{q^{r_2}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ with $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that $|a_2| \mid q^{r_1}-1$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to verify its scattered behavior of index $t \in \{r_1,r_2\}$. We also connect such scattered binomials with the well known Lunardon-Polverino polynomial. With conditions on $\delta, q,n$, and $r$; we present a new family of exceptional scattered polynomial $S(x)=x^q+\delta x^{q^{(2r+1)}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ of index $\{r+1\}$.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the VC-Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a well-studied and fundamental complexity measure of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a $1$-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We design a $2^{\mathcal{O}(\rm{tw}\cdot \log \rm{tw})}\cdot |V|$-time algorithm for any graph $G=(V,E)$ of treewidth $\rm{tw}$ (which, for a set system, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). This is in contrast with closely related problems that require a double-exponential dependency on the treewidth (assuming the ETH).</description>
