      <title>Holographic Strange Metals for Philosophers and Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the physics and philosophy of strange metals, which are characterized by unusual electrical and thermal properties that deviate from conventional metallic behaviour. The anomalous strange-metal behaviour discussed here appears in the normal state of a copper-oxide high-temperature superconductor, and it cannot be described using standard condensed-matter physics. Currently, it can only be described through a holographic dual, viz.~a four-dimensional black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This paper first introduces the theory of, and specific experiments carried out on, strange metals. Then it discusses a number of philosophical questions that strange metals open up regarding the experimental evidence for holography and its realist interpretation. Strange metals invert the explanatory arrows, in that usual holographic arguments are seen as giving explanations of the bulk quantum-gravity theory from the boundary. By contrast, the aim here is, by using holography, to explain the experimentally discovered and anomalous properties of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity treats spacetime as dynamical and exhibits its breakdown at singularities. This failure is interpreted as evidence that quantum gravity is not a theory formulated within spacetime; instead, it must explain the very emergence of spacetime from deeper quantum degrees of freedom, thereby resolving singularities. Quantum gravity is therefore envisaged as an axiomatic structure, and algorithmic calculations acting on these axioms are expected to generate spacetime. However, G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness establish intrinsic limits on any such algorithmic programme. Together, these results imply that a wholly algorithmic "Theory of Everything" is impossible: certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding. We formalize this by constructing a "Meta-Theory of Everything" grounded in non-algorithmic understanding, showing how it can account for undecidable phenomena and demonstrating that the breakdown of computational descriptions of nature does not entail a breakdown of science. Because any putative simulation of the universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the universe cannot be a simulation.</description>

      <title>Pascual Jordan's "Erweiterte Gravitationstheorie" - A Historical Analysis of its Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to highlight Pascual Jordan's axiomatic definition of the covariant derivative, as set out in his 1952 textbook "Schwerkraft und Weltall". Developed in light of his \emph{Erweiterte Gravitationstheorie} - a projective reformulation of relativity theory that incorporates a variable gravitational constant - Jordan's definition resembles those in contemporary usage. The paper contextualises Jordan's work within the broader historical frameworks of differential geometry and projective relativity, with a particular focus on the Princeton relativity group led by Oswald Veblen and Luther Pfahl Eisenhart. It also provides a summary of Jordan's formalism, focusing particularly on his definition of the covariant derivative, as well as a brief history of the origin and development of the covariant derivative.</description>

      <title>A translation of the paper "Presentation of some observations that could be made to shed light on Meteorology" by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1771)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mulhouse mathematician Jean-Henri (or Johann Heinrich) Lambert (August 26 or 28, 1728; September 25, 1777) is well known for having devised the conformal conic projection in 1772, which is still used in some graphical outputs of our weather forecasting models, under the name "Lambert projection" Less well known is that he also devised the idea of a minimum temperature value corresponding to $-270${\deg}C in 1777, the year of his death and therefore 70 years before Lord Kelvin. But Johann Heinrich Lambert also published in 1771 an even lesser-known article, which is the subject of this publication. This article, written in Old French and published in a German journal, described in a rather striking manner the idea of a global observation network where the Earth would be divided into different zones where observers would record the same wind, temperature, pressure, and other current weather data at the same fixed times. The goal would then be to pool all this data to seek to understand how meteorological phenomena evolve in space and time, and to make meteorology a science on a par with astronomy.</description>
