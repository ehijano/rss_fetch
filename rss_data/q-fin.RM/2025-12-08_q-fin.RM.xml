      <title>Standard and stressed value at risk forecasting using dynamic Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) framework for forecasting value at risk (VaR) and stressed VaR (SVaR) and compares its performance to several commonly applied models. Using daily S&amp;P 500 index returns from 1991 to 2020, we produce 10-day 99% VaR and SVaR forecasts using a rolling period and historical returns for the traditional models, while three DBNs use both historical and forecasted returns. We evaluate the models' forecasting accuracy using standard backtests and forecasting error measures. Results show that autoregressive models deliver the most accurate VaR forecasts, while the DBNs achieve comparable performance to the historical simulation model, despite incorporating forward-looking return forecasts. For SVaR, all models produce highly conservative forecasts, with minimal breaches and limited differentiation in accuracy. While DBNs do not outperform traditional models, they demonstrate feasibility as a forward-looking approach to provide a foundation for future research on integrating causal inference into financial risk forecasting.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Modeling for Enhanced Credit Risk Management in Supply Chain Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small- and medium-sized sellers, yet financing remains a critical challenge due to their limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk measures estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study explores the use of generative models in CBEC SCF risk management, illustrating their potential to strengthen credit assessment and support financing for small- and medium-sized sellers.</description>
