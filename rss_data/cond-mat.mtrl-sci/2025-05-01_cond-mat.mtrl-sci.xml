      <title>SDW driven "magnetic breakdown" in a d-wave altermagnet KV$_2$Se$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, combining zero net magnetization with intrinsic spin splitting, demonstrate unique quantum phenomena crucial for spintronic applications. KV$_2$Se$_2$O is proven to be a d-wave altermagnet with phase transition from a checkerboard-type (C-type) antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a spin density wave (SDW) state as the temperature decreases. After phase transition, the apparent paradox emerges where angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals negligible Fermi surface modifications, while physical property measurement system (PPMS) measurements uncover substantial changes in transport properties. Our study explores the microscopic mechanisms governing phase-dependent transport properties of KV$_2$Se$_2$O base on first-principles calculations. The spin canting driven by periodic spin modulation in the SDW phase reduces the magnetic symmetry of KV$_2$Se$_2$O. The resultant band degeneracy lifting and Fermi surface reconstruction induce the ``magnetic breakdown" phenomenon, which alters carrier trajectories, modifies carrier concentration, strengthens electron-hole compensation, and ultimately accounts for the contrasting magnetic-field-dependent Hall resistivity relative to the C-type AFM state. Our work proposes an innovative method for identifying the electronic structure evolution across phase transitions from transport signatures, providing a novel paradigm for altermagnets research.</description>

      <title>Materials discovery acceleration by using condition generative methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, generative models have been increasingly employed in the exploration of novel materials. By integrating traditional computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), existing generative models, including diffusion models and autoregressive models, have demonstrated remarkable potential in the discovery of novel materials. However, their efficiency in goal-directed materials design remains suboptimal. In this work we developed a highly transferable, efficient and robust conditional generation framework, PODGen, by integrating a general generative model with multiple property prediction models. Based on PODGen, we designed a workflow for the high-throughput crystals conditional generation which is used to search new topological insulators (TIs). Our results show that the success rate of generating TIs using our framework is 5.3 times higher than that of the unconstrained approach. More importantly, while general methods rarely produce gapped TIs, our framework succeeds consistently, highlighting an effectively $\infty$ improvement. This demonstrates that conditional generation significantly enhances the efficiency of targeted material discovery. Using this method, we generated tens of thousands of new topological materials and conducted further first-principles calculations on those with promising application potential. Furthermore, we identified promising, synthesizable topological (crystalline) insulators such as CsHgSb, NaLaB$_{12}$, Bi$_4$Sb$_2$Se$_3$, Be$_3$Ta$_2$Si and Be$_2$W.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Advancements of the FHI-aims Software Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic band splitting in 10 nm epitaxial CrSb thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 1 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals. The distinct altermagnetic band structure required for potential spin-transport applications survives down to the 10 nm thin film limit at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Site-Percolation-Driven Ionic Conductivity in Random Substitutional Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random Substitutional Crystals (RSCs), where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this competitive relation. Although extensive studies have focused on local ionic hopping, the role of mesoscale structural organization in determining macroscopic conductivity remains poorly understood, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of NaCl-type RSCs as a function of composition using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the carrier ion concentration exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Tensile Behavior and Dislocation Dynamics in Cu and Ag Nanowires: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using molecular dynamics simulations, the research examine how copper and silver nanowires respond to tensile loading in order to clarify their nanoscale deformation mechanisms. The results demonstrate that these two metal nanowires follow notably different stress - strain trends, with silver wires exhibiting greater elastic stiffness and higher yield points at equivalent diameters - an effect likely rooted in silver's stronger atomic bonding and more stable microstructure. A pronounced size effect is observed: as the wire diameter diminishes, both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase substantially, a behavior driven by the higher proportion of surface atoms that enhance dislocation nucleation and mobility. Atomistic analyses further underscore the dominant role of dislocations during plastic deformation, and in particular reveal that surface - initiated dislocations in thinner wires critically affect their fracture behavior.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) on the Transformation Behavior in Sputtered Ti-rich TiNiPd Shape Memory Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TiNiPd based shape memory alloys (SMAs) share similar microstructural features as TiNiCu-based SMAs known for their exceptional resistance to functional fatigue due to their high crystallographic compatibility, nanometer sized grains and coherent precipitates, making them an ideal system to further explore the critical factors influencing cyclic stability. In this study, we investigate the effect of heat treatments (500 {\deg}C, 600 {\deg}C, 700 {\deg}C and 800 {\deg}C) on the cyclic stability and microstructure of free-standing, magnetron-sputtered Ti$_{53.6}$Ni$_{35.2}$Pd$_{11.2}$ films. All heat treatments promote the formation of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) precipitates and result in a similar grain size (~1-4 $\mu$m). Lower heat treatment temperatures improve the cyclic stability of the stress induced transformation while reducing transformation temperatures and latent heat. Temperature dependent X-ray diffraction reveals a complex microstructure for the martensite phase with Ti$_2$Pd(Ni), Ti$_2$Ni(Pd), TiNiPd(B2), B19/B19$'$ and R-phase. The thermal phase transition changes from a distinct 1st order to a 2nd order like transition, accompanied by increasing amount of remanent austenite and R-phase, with nearly no change for the sample heat treated at 500 {\deg}C. In situ stress dependent X-ray diffraction demonstrates a significant difference between the temperature and stress induced phase transformation for this heat treatment. The observed semi crystalline microstructure, featuring nano domains of Ti$_2$Pd(Ni) precipitates in the sample heat-treated at 500 {\deg}C, leads to a mixture of long range martensitic and strain glass transition. This study highlights the impact of heat treatment and microstructure on the phase transformation behavior and functional fatigue in Ti-rich TiNiPd alloys.</description>

      <title>Transition States Energies from Machine Learning: An Application to Reverse Water-Gas Shift on Single-Atom Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF) predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models. Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS, providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Unveiling competitions between carrier recombination pathways in semiconductors via mechanical damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total rate of carrier recombination in semiconductors has conventionally been expressed using an additive model, r_total = \Sigma r_i , which rules out the interactions between carrier recombination pathways. Here we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating pathway competitions using our newly developed light-induced mechanical absorption spectroscopy (LIMAS), which allows us to probe genuine recombination dynamics in semiconductors via mechanical damping. We show that the total recombination rate in zinc sulfide (ZnS), a model semiconductor material, follows a multiplicative weighting model, r_total \propto \Pi r_i ^(w_i) with \Sigma w_i=1. Under both steady-state and switch-on illuminations, the weighting factors w_i for each recombination pathway-direct, trap-assisted, and sublinear-are dictated by the carrier generation mechanism: (i) interband transition favors direct recombination; (ii) single-defect level-mediated generation promotes trap-assisted recombination; (iii) generation involving multiple saturated defect levels gives rise to sublinear recombination. Upon light switch-off, localized state changes drive a dynamic evolution of w_i, altering pathway competitions. These findings reshape our fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics and provide a new strategy to optimize next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear thermoelectric effects as a means to probe quantum geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which has the quantum metric and Berry curvature as its real and imaginary parts, plays a key role in the transport properties of condensed matter systems. In the nonlinear regime, the quantum metric dipole and Berry curvature dipole provide two distinct mechanisms for generating nonlinear Hall effects, which can both be experimentally observed in systems with suitable symmetries. In this work, we investigate the role of quantum geometry in nonlinear thermoelectric responses. We derive a series of nonlinear thermoelectric effects governed by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric dipole, respectively. Among them, we identify a particularly interesting quantized thermoelectric response that directly measures the total chirality of Weyl points below the Fermi level. For general nonlinear responses, we derive the nonlinear analogs of the Wiedemann-Franz law and Mott's formula. These provide a means to estimate the magnitude of nonlinear thermoelectric responses based on existing nonlinear Hall measurements. Our estimates suggest that these effects should be observable in several candidate materials, with In-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te standing out as the most promising. Our work offers new insights into the experimental study of quantum geometry through nonlinear thermoelectric measurements.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors are a new class of quantum materials for studying the emergent physics of excitons and spins in the 2D limit. Twist engineering provides a powerful tool to manipulate the fundamental properties of 2D vdW materials. Here, we show that twist engineering of the anisotropic ferromagnetic monolayer semiconductor, CrSBr, leads to bilayer magnetic semiconductors with continuously tunable magnetic moment, dielectric anisotropy, exciton energy and linear dichroism. We furthermore provide a model for exciton energy in the media with tunable anisotropy. These results advance fundamental studies on 2D vdW materials and open doors to applications to nano-optics, twistronics, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Wilson polygons and the topology of zero-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that zero-dimensional (0-D) systems can host non-trivial topology analogous to macroscopic topological materials in greater dimensions. Unlike macroscopic periodic systems with translational symmetry, zero-dimensional materials such as molecules, clusters and quantum dots can exhibit discrete rotation symmetry. The eigenstates can thus be grouped into discrete bands and Bloch-like wave functions. Since the symmetry is discrete, the Berry phase and the topological indices must be defined by discrete Wilson polygons. Here, we demonstrate non-trivial Z2 orders in two representative 0-D molecules, [m]-Cycloparaphenylene and [m]-iso-thianaphthene, where topological transitions occur when modifying the coupling between the repeating units. Similar to macroscopic topological systems in greater dimensions, localized boundary states emerge in composite nanohoops formed by segments that are topologically distinct. This opens up the possibility of non-trivial topological phases in 0-D systems.</description>

      <title>Wideband covariance magnetometry below the diffraction limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for measuring correlations of wideband magnetic signals with spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our technique employs two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale magnetometers, spectrally resolved by inhomogeneous optical transitions. Using high-fidelity optical readout and long spin coherence time, we probe correlated MHz-range noise with sensitivity of 15 nT Hz$^{-1/4}$. In addition, we use this system for correlated $T_1$ relaxometry, enabling correlation measurements of GHz-range noise. Under such externally applied noise, while individual NV centers exhibit featureless relaxation, their correlation displays rich coherent and incoherent dynamics reminiscent of superradiance physics. This capability to probe high-frequency correlations provides a powerful tool for investigating a variety of condensed-matter phenomena characterized by nonlocal correlations.</description>

      <title>Photoengineering the Magnon Spectrum in an Insulating Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond optical pulses have opened a new frontier in ultrafast dynamics, enabling direct access to fundamental interactions in quantum materials. In antiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange interaction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling, enabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that naturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities. Femtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons across the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such as the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step, enabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction pathways. Yet, achieving this remains a challenge, requiring ultrafast and long-lasting manipulation of the underlying exchange interaction. Here, we show that in DyFeO3 - an insulating AFM with strongly coupled electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom - resonant above-bandgap optical excitation leads to a dramatic renormalization of the THz magnon spectrum, including a near-total collapse of the magnon gap. Our analysis reveals this transformation to be consistent with a transient reduction of the exchange interaction by nearly 90% in the near-surface nanoscale region. These findings establish a pathway for light-driven, nanoscale control of AFM spin dynamics, opening opportunities for reconfigurable, high-speed magnonic and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Differentiating anomalous and topological Hall effects using first-order reversal curve measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next generation magnetic memories rely on novel magnetic phases for information storage. Novel spin textures such as skyrmions provide one possible avenue forward due to their topological protection and controllability via electric fields. However, the common signature of these spin textures, the topological Hall effect (THE), can be mimicked by other trivial effects. Competing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) components can produce a peak in the Hall voltage similar to that of the THE, making clear identification of the THE difficult. By applying the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique to the Hall effect in candidate topological Hall systems we can clearly distinguish between the THE and AHE. This technique allows for quantitative investigation of the THE and AHE in magnetic materials and heterostructures with topologically non-trivial spin textures. We demonstrate the technique and apply it to several examples.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\beta)$. At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of $\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), where zero-resistance states appear nonreciprocally during current injection, is receiving tremendous interest in both fundamental and applied physics because the SDE is a novel manifestation of symmetry breaking and enables the creation of a novel diode. In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe. Our findings can pave a new avenue for the construction of novel material and device platforms utilizing SDEs.</description>

Abstract: The dependencies of the resistance on the applied voltage of a series of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) powders was studied. The MoSxOy samples were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. These materials had the structure of nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes. Chemical composition of the materials was evaluated by XPS and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The MoSxOy nanoflakes revealed unusual electric transport features. The current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grew monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, containing ca. 25 % of Mo in oxidized species (in contrast to MoS2), being non-ohmic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. On the other hand, the I-V curves acquire N-like shaped with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity (NDR) part for the samples containing more than 50 % of Mo in oxidized forms. In all cases the I-V curves manifested hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters depended on the Ts. Important, that the studied nanoflakes were characterized by very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off". The flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes was proposed, and the observed I-V curves were theoretically described. The revealed experimentally and explained features of resistive switching and charge accumulation in the MoSxOy materials look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory with linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets is useful for studying large atomic systems, especially when it comes to computationally highly demanding time-dependent dynamics. We have implemented the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (ED) method with the approximate approach of Tomfohr and Sankey within the projector augmented-wave code GPAW. We apply this method to small molecules as well as larger periodic systems, and elucidate its limits, advantages, and disadvantages in comparison to the existing implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with a real-space grid representation. For modest atomic velocities, LCAO-ED shows satisfactory accuracy at a much reduced computational cost. This method will be particularly useful for modeling ion irradiation processes that require large amounts of vacuum in the simulation cell.</description>

      <title>Predicting the N\'eel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site N\'eel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site N\'eel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moir\'e superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. These findings advance the understanding of twist-engineered interfacial thermal transport, offering design principles for optimizing thermal management in devices based on van der Waals layered materials.</description>

Abstract: Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we demonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ligand vs. Linker on Phase Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle Gels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle gels have attracted considerable attention due to their highly tunable properties. One strategy for producing nanoparticle gels involves using strong local attractions between polymeric molecules, such as DNA hybridization or dynamic covalent chemistry, to form percolated nanoparticle networks. These molecules can be used in two distinct roles: as "ligands" with one end grafted to a nanoparticle or as "linkers" with both ends free. Here, we explore how these roles shape the phase behavior and mechanical properties of gel-like nanoparticle assemblies using coarse-grained simulations. We systematically vary the interaction strength and bending stiffness of both ligands and linkers. We find that phase separation can be limited to low nanoparticle volume fractions by making the ligands rigid, consistent with previous studies on linked nanoparticle gels. At fixed interaction strength and volume fraction, both ligand- and linker-mediated nanoparticle assemblies show similar mechanical responses as bending stiffness is varied. However, a comparison between the two association schemes reveals that the linked nanoparticles form rigid percolated networks that are less stretchable than the ligand-grafted gels, despite exhibiting similar tensile strength. We attribute these differences between ligands and linkers to the distinct structural arrangement of nanoparticles within the gel. Our findings highlight the potential to use different association schemes to tune specific mechanical properties.</description>

Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>
