      <title>Competition, stability, and functionality in excitatory-inhibitory neural circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based models have become a central paradigm for understanding computation and stability in both theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. However, the energetic framework typically relies on symmetry in synaptic or weight matrices - a constraint that excludes biologically realistic systems such as excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) networks. When symmetry is relaxed, the classical notion of a global energy landscape fails, leaving the dynamics of asymmetric neural systems conceptually unanchored. In this work, we extend the energetic framework to asymmetric firing rate networks, revealing an underlying game-theoretic structure for the neural dynamics in which each neuron is an agent that seeks to minimize its own energy. In addition, we exploit rigorous stability principles from network theory to study regulation and balancing of neural activity in E-I networks. We combine the novel game-energetic interpretation and the stability results to revisit standard frameworks in theoretical neuroscience, such as the Wilson-Cowan and lateral inhibition models. These insights allow us to study cortical columns of lateral inhibition microcircuits as contrast enhancer - with the ability to selectively sharpen subtle differences in the environment through hierarchical excitation-inhibition interplay. Our results bridge energetic and game-theoretic views of neural computation, offering a pathway toward the systematic engineering of biologically grounded, dynamically stable neural architectures.</description>

      <title>SSDLabeler: Realistic semi-synthetic data generation for multi-label artifact classification in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.</description>

      <title>Decoding Selective Auditory Attention to Musical Elements in Ecologically Valid Music Listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Language in the Developing Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few million words suffice for children to acquire language. Yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this unique ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigate neural activity recorded from over 7,400 electrodes implanted in the brains of 46 children, teenagers, and adults for epilepsy monitoring, as they listened to an audiobook version of "The Little Prince". We then train neural encoding and decoding models using representations, derived either from linguistic theory or from large language models, to map the location, dynamics and development of the language hierarchy in the brain. We find that a broad range of linguistic features is robustly represented across the cortex, even in 2-5-year-olds. Crucially, these representations evolve with age: while fast phonetic features are already present in the superior temporal gyrus of the youngest individuals, slower word-level representations only emerge in the associative cortices of older individuals. Remarkably, this neuro-developmental trajectory is spontaneously captured by large language models: with training, these AI models learned representations that can only be identified in the adult human brain. Together, these findings reveal the maturation of language representations in the developing brain and show that modern AI systems provide a promising tool to model the neural bases of language acquisition.</description>
