      <title>Nonlinear excitations in multi-dimensional nonlocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of breathers in multi-dimensional lattices with nonlocal coupling that decays algebraically. By variational methods, the exact relationship between various parameters (dimension, nonlinearity, nonlocal parameter $\alpha$) that defines positive excitation thresholds is characterized. At the anti-continuum regime, there exists a family of unique ground states that determines excitation thresholds. We not only characterize the sharp spatial decay of ground states, which varies continuously in $\alpha$, but also identify the time decay of dispersive waves, which undergoes a discontinuous transition in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Stability of smooth solitary waves under intensity--dependent dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) in one dimension is considered in the presence of an intensity-dependent dispersion term. We study bright solitary waves with smooth profiles which extend from the limit where the dependence of the dispersion coefficient on the wave intensity is negligible to the limit where the solitary wave becomes singular due to vanishing dispersion coefficient. We analyze and numerically explore the stability for such smooth solitary waves, showing with the help of numerical approximations that the family of solitary waves becomes unstable in the intermediate region between the two limits, while being stable in both limits. This bistability, that has also been observed in other NLS equations with the generalized nonlinearity, brings about interesting dynamical transitions from one stable branch to another stable branch, that are explored in direct numerical simulations of the NLS equation with the intensity-dependent dispersion term.</description>

      <title>Second and third harmonic generation of acoustic waves in a nonlinear elastic solid in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of second and third harmonics by an acoustic wave propagating along one dimension in a weakly nonlinear elastic medium that is loaded harmonically in time with frequency $\omega_0$ at a single point in space, is analyzed by successive approximations starting with the linear case. It is noted that nonlinear waves have a speed of propagation that depends on their amplitude. It is also noted that both a free medium as well as a loaded medium generate higher harmonics, but that although the second harmonic of the free medium scales like the square of the linear wave, this is no longer the case when the medium is externally loaded. The shift in speed of propagation due to the nonlinearities is determined imposing that there be no resonant terms in a successive approximation solution scheme to the homogeneous problem. The result is then used to solve the inhomogeneous case also by successive approximations, up to the third order. At second order, the result is a second harmonic wave whose amplitude is modulated by a long wave, whose wavelength is inversely proportional to the shift in the speed of propagation of the linear wave due to nonlinearities. The amplitude of the long modulating wave scales like the amplitude of the linear wave to the four thirds. At short distances from the source a scaling proportional to the amplitude of the linear wave squared is recovered, as is a second harmonic amplitude that grows linearly with distance from the source and depends on the third-order elastic constant only. The third order solution is the sum of four amplitude-modulated waves, two of them oscillate with frequency $\omega_0$ and the other two, third harmonics, with $3\omega_0$. In each pair, one term scales like the amplitude of the linear wave to the five-thirds, and the other to the seven-thirds.</description>

      <title>Soliton Dynamics of a Gauged Fokas-Lenells Equation Under Varying Effects of Dispersion and Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Davydova-Lashkin-Fokas-Lenells equation (DLFLE) is a gauged equivalent form of Fokas-Lenells equation (FLE) that addresses both spatio-temporal dispersion (STD) and nonlinear dispersion (ND) effects. The balance between those effects results a soliton which has always been an interesting topic in research due to its potential applicability as signal carrier in information technology. We have induced a variation to the dispersion effects and apply Hirota bilinear method to realise soliton solution of the proposed DLFLE and explore how the soliton dynamic behaves in accordance to the variation of the dispersion effects. The proposed equation is applicable for number of systems like ultrashort optical pulse, ioncyclotron plasma wave, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) matter-wave soliton under certain external fields, etc. The study on such systems under varying effects is very limited and we hope our work can benefit the researchers to understand soliton dynamics more and work on various other nonlinear fields under varying effects.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate for the "sound" wave the coefficient of reflection from (the coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds and the wave impedances. When only the capacitors or only the inductors are nonlinear, the coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds only. We explicitly include into consideration of the shocks the dissipation, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>
