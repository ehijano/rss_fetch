      <title>Scalable, Wireless Determination of Electric Properties of Nanostructures via Electro-Rotation in Water Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breakthroughs in nanotechnology have enabled the large-scale fabrication of nanoparticles with varied compositions and structures. Yet, evaluating their electrical conductivities remains challenging due to high volume and individual variability. We report a rapid, wireless, and parallel method to characterize longitudinal nanostructures, including insulators, semiconductors, and conducting metal oxides by using MoO3, MoS2/MoO2, and MoS2 nanoribbons, produced at different fabrication stages, as a model system. Leveraging our semi-quantitative model based on Maxwell-Wagner and electrical double-layer polarization, electric conductivities of various nanoparticles are determined from their distinct electro-rotation behaviors in water, spanning six orders of magnitude. The results agree well with standard four-probe measurements. These findings highlight a non-destruction, rapid, simple characterization method promising to bring nanomaterials closer to practical applications in electronics, optics, sensing, catalysis, and robotics.</description>

      <title>A compact quasi-zero stiffness metamaterial based on monolithic shells for vibration isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) metamaterials are highly effective in isolating objects from low-frequency external vibrations, due to their high static stiffness but low dynamic stiffness characteristics. Traditionally, QZS metamaterials are designed by combining a negative-stiffness part with a positive-stiffness counterpart. Here, we present a novel QZS metamaterial design without relying on combining two components. The QZS characteristic is achieved solely through monolithic shell elements' unique geometry and nonlinear deformation. Using experimental and numerical approaches, we investigate the static and dynamic responses of the proposed metamaterials as a function of their geometric parameters. We then tune the structure's geometry to achieve ideal zero-stiffness behaviors and experimentally demonstrate an exceptional low-frequency vibration isolation mechanism. This concept can be further utilized as a building block for constructing metamaterials with multiple zero-stiffness features, enabling a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Spin light-emitting devices in a 2D magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors represent transformative platforms to explore magneto-optics and opto-spintronic applications. Though 2D opto-spintronics has attracted tremendous research efforts in spin-dependent photodetectors and non-volatile memory components, the realization of one core application - spin-modulated light-emitting device (spin-LED) - remains elusive so far. Here we successfully realize prototype spin-LED integrated with a 2D semiconducting magnet CrSBr, demonstrating considerable electroluminescence (EL) down to bilayers. Intriguingly, the EL of the spin-LED is discovered to be directly manipulated by spin-flip and spin-canting transitions. Notably, spin-flip transitions enable unprecedented hysteretic behaviors of EL characteristics, while spin-canting transitions induce EL continuous modulation with robust anisotropy. This versatile manipulation is originated from the synergy of magnetic-order mediated excitonic transitions and spintronic transport. The prototype demonstration of spin-LED establishes an indispensable scheme of opto-spintronic devices leveraging 2D spin transitions and strong excitonic effects, presenting a critical step towards integrated 2D opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Vector spin Seebeck effect and spin swapping effect in antiferromagnetic insulators with non-collinear spin structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFs) are prospective for next-generation high-density and high-speed spintronic applications due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics, notwithstanding the challenges in detecting and manipulating AF order with no magnetization (M = 0). Among the AFs, non-collinear AFs are of particular interest because of their unique properties arising from the non-collinear spin structure and the small magnetization M. In this work, we describe the recently observed vector spin Seebeck effect in non-collinear LuFeO$_3$, where the magneto-thermovoltage under an in-plane temperature gradient, not previously observed, is consistent with the predicted spin swapping effect. Our results shed light on the importance of the non-collinear spin structure in the emerging spin phenomena in non-collinear AFs and offer a new class of materials for AF spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Switching of Magnon Spin Current in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of directional magnon propagation, known as magnon spin current, is essential for developing magnonic memory and logic devices featuring nonvolatile functionalities and ultralow power consumption. Magnon spin current can usually be modulated by magnetic field or current-induced spin torques. However, these approaches may lead to energy dissipation caused by Joule heating. Electric-field switching of magnon spin current without charge current is highly desired but very challenging to realize. By integrating magnonic and piezoelectric materials, we demonstrate manipulation of the magnon spin current generated by the spin Seebeck effect in the ferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG) film on a piezoelectric substrate. We observe reversible electric-field switching of magnon polarization without applied charge current. Through strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces the magnetic compensation transition between two magnetic states of the GdIG, resulting in its magnetization reversal and the simultaneous switching of magnon spin current. Our work establishes a prototype material platform that pave the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric field reading and writing and reveals the underlying physics principles of their functions.</description>

      <title>Atomic Interface Engineering of Battery Current Collectors via Ion Implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic interface engineering (AIE) is critical for advancing technologies in energy storage, catalysis, and microelectronics. In anode-less lithium metal batteries (ALLMBs), AIE is essential for controlling interfacial chemistry governing lithium deposition and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on copper current collectors. However, native copper surfaces readily oxidize, forming electronically insulating oxides that degrade performance and obscure failure mechanisms. Here, we report a scalable ion implantation strategy to create an atomically clean and robust copper interface. By implanting copper ions into commercial foils, we simultaneously remove the native oxide and introduce subsurface vacancy clusters that act as oxygen traps, yielding an oxidation-resistant and conductive surface. Experimental characterization and multiscale simulations reveal that these engineered vacancies suppress reoxidation and guide the formation of an ultrathin Li2O-enriched solid electrolyte interphase. When applied in ALLMBs, the current collectors enable uniform lithium deposition, suppress parasitic reactions, and deliver a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% over 400 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions. This work presents a generalizable and industry-compatible approach for stabilizing electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Voltage-Controlled Cryogenic Boolean Logic Paradigm with Quantum-Enhanced Josephson Junction FETs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra low power computing and the emergence of quantum technologies have intensified interest in cryogenic electronics, particularly superconducting devices.Despite their promise, current controlled superconducting components face fundamental challenges in cascadability, limiting their effectiveness in complex logic architectures.To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on developing gate tunable superconducting devices, such as Josephson Junction Field Effect Transistors (JJFETs).However, achieving robust control and sufficient supercurrent gain, both critical for transistor-like performance in logic circuits remains a key challenge.A recent advancement in JJFET design, based on InAs and GaSb heterostructures, demonstrates enhanced gain and favorable device characteristics suitable for circuit integration.Building on this innovation, we propose and analyze fundamental voltage controlled logic topologies using the quantum enhanced JJFET. We develop a Verilog A based circuit compatible compact model of the quantum enhanced JJFET which accurately captures the experimentally observed device characteristics.To ensure cascadability, our logic circuits incorporate the multilayered Heater Nanocryotron (nTron), a superconducting nanowire-based thermal switch.Through simulation based analysis, we demonstrate the successful implementation of fundamental logic gates, including NOT, NAND, and NOR. Furthermore, we design a 3 input majority gate, which plays a pivotal role in quantum and reversible computing due to its universality.Finally, to demonstrate the cascadability of our proposed logic topology, we demonstrate the operation of a 2 input XOR gate based on our designed JJFET based NOT, NAND, and NOR gate.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Probing of Materials Plasmonic Properties using Fabry-Perot Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate in situ characterization of plasmonic materials dispersion and efficiency remains a key challenge for next generation nanophotonic devices. To this end, we introduce a platform leveraging extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through plasmonic gratings comprised of subwavelength Fabry Perot (FP) resonators to interrogate the optical response of plasmonic materials. We implement direct E k dispersion mapping across a well defined set of optical momenta by systematically varying the grating size, with each grating serving as a discrete momentum-space probe. Non Hermitian modal decomposition is carried out by means of the finite element method (FEM) and validated with finite difference time domain (FDTD) to examine the eigenstates of the plasmonic systems and analyze the modal hybridization within the aperture. The interplay between the resonant mechanisms involved in the enhanced transmitted field is investigated in both an idealized perfect electric conducting metal and a realistic dispersive metal, emphasizing the aperture s role in mode confinement and resonance shift. This approach provides an angle insensitive platform for reliable, in situ and real time characterization of established and emerging plasmonic materials.</description>

      <title>A More Convex Ising Formulation of Max-3-Cut Using Higher-Order Spin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers: changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut, which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work - approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Metasurfaces with Structural Chirality and Pseudo-Chirality for Enhanced Circular Dichroism and Enantiomeric Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and optical characterization of a plasmonic metasurface engineered to exhibit strong polarization anisotropy under both linearly and circularly polarized light. The metasurface consists of geometrically asymmetric gold nanostructures arranged periodically on a glass substrate. Each nanostructure is formed by the fusion of three equilateral triangles. The nanostructures simultaneously break mirror and inversion symmetries, resulting in chiral and pseudo-chiral optical responses that manifest as linear and circular polarization-dependent spectral features. Our numerical and experimental results reveal clear chiroptical effects in both near- and far-field. Near-field scanning optical microscopy confirms the excitation of polarization-selective localized plasmonic modes, with spatially distinct hot-spots lighting up under different incident polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metasurface exhibits a measurable enantiospecific optical response when coated with thin left- or right-handed chiral overlayers. The differential circular dichroism signals observed in the presence of opposite enantiomers highlight the potential of the metasurface for label-free chiral sensing. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between structural anisotropy, pseudo-chirality, and enantioselective interactions in planar plasmonic systems. Our findings highlight the ability of planar metasurfaces to emulate chiral optical behavior without requiring volumetric 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Photolithography-Compatible Three-Terminal Superconducting Switch for Driving CMOS Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting devices have enabled breakthrough performance in quantum sensing and ultra-low-power computing. Nevertheless, the need for a cryo-electronics platform that can interface superconducting electronics with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) devices has become increasingly evident in many cutting-edge applications. In this work, we present a three-terminal micrometer-wide superconducting wire-based cryotron switch (wTron), fabricated using photolithography, that can directly interface with CMOS electronics. The wTron features an output impedance exceeding 1 k$\Omega$ and exhibits reduced sensitivity to ambient magnetic noise, similar to its nanoscale predecessor, the nanocryotron. In addition, its micrometer-wide wires support switching currents in the mA range, making wTrons well-suited for driving current-hungry resistive loads and highly capacitive CMOS loads. We demonstrate this capability by using the wTron to drive room-temperature CMOS electronics, including an LED and a MOSFET with a gate capacitance of 500 pF. We then examine the optimal design parameters of wTrons to drive CMOS loads, such as MOSFETs, HEMTs, and electro-optic modulators. Furthermore, to demonstrate the foundry readiness of the wTron, we fabricated wTrons using MIT Lincoln Laboratory's SFQ5ee superconducting process and characterized their switching behavior. Our work shows that wTron will facilitate the interface between superconducting electronics and CMOS, thereby paving the way for the development of foundry-compatible cryo-electronic ecosystems to advance next-generation computing and quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: As the terahertz (THz) band emerges as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless communications, accurate channel modeling in dynamic environments becomes increasingly critical, particularly for scenarios involving reflective interactions with water surfaces. This article presents comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations into THz channel (120-320 GHz) performance under dynamic water surface reflections. By developing and validating a modified dual-scale scattering model based on the improved integral equation model (I2EM), this work systematically evaluates channel characteristics, such as signal power loss and bit error rate (BER), across various dynamic aquatic scenarios. Laboratory experiments and real-world natatorium measurements demonstrate the model's efficacy in capturing complex temporal and spatial scattering behaviors, offering vital insights and robust predictive capabilities essential for deploying possible THz communication systems in aquatic and sports environments.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.</description>

Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle wells) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by an empirical nonlocal pseudopotential model to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interactions between valley states across neighboring Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to extend the one-dimensional SCLC from planar gaps to more complicated geometries. However, introducing a magnetic field orthogonal to the diode's electric field complicates these calculations due to changes in the electron trajectory. This paper extends a recent study that applied variational calculus to determine the SCLC for a cylindrical crossed-field diode to derive an equation that is valid for any orthogonal coordinate system. We then derive equations for the SCLC for crossed-field gaps in spherical, tip-to-tip, and tip-to-plane geometries that can be solved numerically. These calculations exhibit a discontinuity at the Hull cutoff magnetic field $B_H$ corresponding to the transition to magnetic insulation as observed analytically for a planar geometry. The ratio of the crossed-field SCLC to the nonmagnetic SCLC becomes essentially independent of geometry when we fix $\delta = D/D_M &gt; 0.6$, where $D$ is the canonical gap distance accounting for geometric effects on electric potential and $D_M$ is the effective gap distance that accounts for magnetic field and geometry. The solutions for these geometries overlap as $\delta \to 1$ since the geometric corrections for electric potential and magnetic field match. This indicates the possibility of more generally accounting for the combination of geometric and magnetic effects when calculating $B_H$ and SCLC.</description>

      <title>Free-Space Characterization Setup for Low-Loss UV-261nm Waveguides in Aluminum Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a characterization setup for low-loss integrated photonic waveguides in aluminum oxide, tailored for deep UV applications. The setup includes a 261nm UV light source, objective lenses for free-space coupling, an automated stage, and a UV camera. The measured losses for the aluminum oxide waveguides in the UV-261nm range were calculated to be 4.9485 dB/cm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the setup in achieving low-loss characterization of integrated photonics waveguides for deep UV applications.</description>

      <title>Spatial Filtering with Nonlocal Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial filtering of optical fields has widespread applications ranging from beam shaping to optical information processing. However, conventional spatial filters are bulky and alignment-sensitive. Here, we present nonlocal non-Hermitian metasurfaces that can act as exceptionally effective optical spatial filters while being highly compact and insensitive to both lateral and longitudinal displacements. The metasurface design is based on a resonant waveguide grating in which radiative losses of the modes are tailored to realize a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum in the middle of a non-Hermitian flat band. Using this design, we propose a compact spatial filtering device operating over an angular range of approximately 1 degree around normal incidence. In addition to being ultrathin and robust against translational misalignment, the proposed metasurfaces are easy to manufacture, which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional spatial filters, holding a potential to become a widely used optical component.</description>
