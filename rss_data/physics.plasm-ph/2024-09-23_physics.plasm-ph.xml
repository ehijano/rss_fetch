      <title>Universal cascade and relaxation of strong anisotropic turbulence in fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the governing equations, exact relations have been derived for three-dimensional reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence corresponding to the inertial range cascade of energy and cross-helicity. Justifications are provided for not attempting to recover the said exact relations as a limit of the exact relations previously derived for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Assuming axial symmetry, anisotropic energy spectrum has been predicted from the exact relation and is found to be consistent with the critical balance thus leading to a -5/3 perpendicular energy spectrum. In the case of a strong alignment between the velocity and the magnetic field fluctuations, the derived exact relation implies a generalized anisotropic spectrum with a -3/2 power-law dependence in the direction of alignment. Using the alternative form of the exact relations, it is shown that the flow naturally relaxes towards a state of dynamic alignment in the limit of negligible kinetic and magnetic pressure. Finally, despite having different equations of dynamics, the exact relations for energy and cross-helicity and the relaxed states of a two-dimensional MHD are found to be identical to those in reduced magnetohydrodynamic flow.</description>

      <title>Electron source based on emergence of self-injected electron bunch at plasma wakefield excitation by a TW laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wakefield acceleration methods are known due to some their advantages. The main of them is the high accelerating gradient up to several teravolts per meter. In the paper another important advantage is concluded to the possibility of using a wakefield accelerator as a source of electrons by means of obtaining self injected bunches and their accelera-tion. The result is the simulation of the process of plasma wakefield excitation by a laser pulse with an energy of tens of mJ and a power of 1-2 TW for obtaining the promising electron source. Homogeneous and Gaussian plasma profiles were investigated and compared to increase the energy of the self-injected bunches. The laser parameters were taken that corresponded to the parameters of the laser setup in the Institute of Plasma Electronics and New Methods of Acceleration of the National Scientific Center "Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology". Based on the results of the simulation, the possibility of obtaining relativistic self-injected bunches that can be used for further laser acceler-ation experiments, including dielectric laser acceleration, was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Effect of gas pressure on plasma asymmetry and higher harmonics generation in sawtooth waveform driven capacitively coupled plasma discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation technique, the effect of gas pressure (5-500 mTorr) on the plasma spatial asymmetry, ionization rate, metastable gas densities profile, electron energy distribution function and higher harmonics generation are studied in a symmetric capacitively coupled plasma discharge driven by a sawtooth-like waveform. At a constant current density of 50 A/m2, the simulation results predict a decrease in the plasma spatial asymmetry (highest at 5mTorr) with increasing gas pressure reaching a minimum value (at intermediate gas pressures) and then turning into a symmetric discharge at higher gas pressures. Conversely, the flux asymmetry shows an opposite trend. At a low gas pressure, the observed strong plasma spatial asymmetry is due to high frequency oscillation on the instantaneous sheath edge position near to one of the electrodes triggered by temporally asymmetry waveform, whereas the flux asymmetry is not present due to collisionless transport of charge particles. At higher pressures, multi-step ionization through metastable states dominates in the plasma bulk, causing a reduction in the plasma spatial asymmetry. Distinct higher harmonics (26th) are observed in the bulk electric field at low pressure and diminished at higher gas pressures. The electron energy distribution function changes its shape from bi-Maxwellian at 5 mTorr to nearly Maxwellian at intermediate pressures and then depletion of the high-energy electrons (below 25 eV) is observed at higher gas pressures. The inclusion of the secondary electron emission is found to be negligible on the observed simulation trend.</description>

      <title>Properties of non-cryogenic DTs and their relevance for fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion, pure deuterium-tritium (DT) is usually used as a fusion fuel. In their paper \cite{gus2011effect}, Guskov et al. instead propose using low-Z compounds that contain DT and are non-cryogenic at room temperature. They suggest that these fuels (here called non-cryogenic DTs) can be ignited for $\rho_{DT} R \geq 0.35 \, gcm^{-2}$ and $kT_{e} \geq 14 \, keV$, i.e., parameters which are more stringent but still in the same order of magnitude as those for DT. In deriving these results the authors in \cite{gus2011effect} assume that ionic and electronic temperatures are equal and consider only electronic stopping power. Here, we show that at temperatures greater than 10 keV, ionic stopping power is not negligible compared to the electronic one. We demonstrate that this necessarily leads to higher ionic than electronic temperatures. Both factors facilitate ignition compared to the model used in \cite{gus2011effect} showing that non-cryogenic DT compounds are more versatile than previously known. In addition, we find that heavy beryllium borohydride ignites more easily than heavy beryllium hydride, the best-performing fuel found by Guskov et al. Our results are based on an analytical model that incorporates a detailed stopping power analysis, as well as on numerical simulations using an improved version of the community hydro code MULTI-IFE. Alleviating the constraints and costs of cryogenic technology and the fact that non-cryogenic DT fuels are solids at room temperature open up new design options for fusion targets with $Q&gt;100$ and thus contribute to the larger goal of making inertial fusion energy an economically viable source of clean energy. In addition, the discussion presented here generalizes the analysis of fuels for energy production.</description>

      <title>Duqtools: Dynamic uncertainty quantification for Tokamak reactor simulations modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale validation and uncertainty quantification are essential in the experimental design, control, and operations of fusion reactors. Reduced models and increasing computational power means that it is possible to run many simulations, yet setting up simulation runs remaining a time-consuming and error-prone process that involves many manual steps. duqtools is an open-source workflow tool written in Python for that addresses this bottleneck by automating the set up of new simulations. This enables uncertainty quantification and large scale validation of fusion energy modelling simulations. In this work, we demonstrate how duqtools can be used to set up and launch 2000 different simulations of plasma experiments to validate aspects of the JINTRAC modelling suite. With this large-scale validation we identified issues in preserving data consistency in model initialization of the current ($I(p)$) distribution. Furthermore, we used duqtools for sensitivity analysis on the QLKNN-jetexp-15D surrogate model to verify its correctness in multiple regimes.</description>

      <title>Synthetic measurements of runaway electron synchrotron emission in the SPARC tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With plasma currents up to 8.7 MA, the SPARC tokamak runs the risk of forming multi-MA beams of relativistic "runaway" electrons (REs) which could damage plasma facing components if unmitigated. The infrared (IR) and visible imaging and visible spectroscopy systems in SPARC are designed with measurements of synchrotron emission from REs in mind. Synchrotron radiation is emitted by REs along their direction of motion, opposite the plasma current. Matched clockwise and counterclockwise wide views are proposed to detect synchrotron and background radiation, allowing observation of RE synchrotron emission in both plasma current configurations. Due to SPARC's high toroidal magnetic field strength, 12.2 T on axis, the synchrotron light spectrum is expected to peak in the visible-IR wavelength range. The synthetic diagnostic tool SOFT (Synchrotron Orbit-Following Toolkit) is used to model synchrotron images and spectra for three scenarios, with appropriate magnetic equilibria for each: REs generated during plasma current ramp-up, steady-state flattop (although unlikely, but serving as a reference), and disruptions. Required time resolutions, achievable spatial coverage, and appropriate spectral ranges for various RE energies are assessed.</description>

      <title>Composition-asymmetric and sheared relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection studies have focused on symmetric configurations so far, where the upstream plasma has identical properties on each side of the layer. The boundary layer between a relativistic jet and an accretion flow forming around a supermassive black hole may present an asymmetric configuration in terms of plasma composition, bulk velocity, temperature and magnetization. In this work, we aim to conduct the first study of relativistic magnetic reconnection where the upstream plasma is composed of electron-positron pairs on one side, and electrons and ions on the other. We also investigate the role of a relativistic symmetric shear flow applied along the reconnecting field lines. We simulate magnetic reconnection using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The initial setup is adapted from a classic Harris layer without guide field, modified to accommodate plasma-composition and shear asymmetries in the upstream medium. For a composition-asymmetric setup, we find that the reconnection dynamics is driven by the electron-ion side, which is the plasma with the lowest magnetization. The energy partition favors accelerating ions at the expense of electrons even more than in a corresponding symmetric setup. With respect to shear, a super-Alfv\'enic upstream decreases the laboratory-frame reconnection rate, but, unlike in non-relativistic studies, does not shut off reconnection completely. The asymmetries examined in this work diminish the overall efficiency of electron acceleration relative to corresponding symmetric configurations. In the context of a black hole jet-disk boundary, asymmetric reconnection alone is probably not efficient at accelerating electrons to very high energies, but it might facilitate plasma mixing and particle injection for other acceleration channels at the interface.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>
