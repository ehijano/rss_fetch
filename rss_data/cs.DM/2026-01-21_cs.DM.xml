      <title>Mathematical and computational perspectives on the Boolean and binary rank and their relation to the real rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the study of the binary and Boolean rank from both a mathematical and a computational perspective, with particular emphasis on their relationship to the real rank. We review the basic definitions of these rank functions and present the main alternative formulations of the binary and Boolean rank, together with their computational complexity and their deep connection to the field of communication complexity. We summarize key techniques used to establish lower and upper bounds on the binary and Boolean rank, including methods from linear algebra, combinatorics and graph theory, isolation sets, the probabilistic method, kernelization, communication protocols and the query to communication lifting technique. Furthermore, we highlight the main mathematical properties of these ranks in comparison with those of the real rank, and discuss several non-trivial bounds on the rank of specific families of matrices. Finally, we present algorithmic approaches for computing and approximating these rank functions, such as parameterized algorithms, approximation algorithms, property testing and approximate Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). Together, the results presented outline the current theoretical knowledge in this area and suggest directions for further research.</description>

      <title>Explicit Almost-Optimal $\varepsilon$-Balanced Codes via Free Expander Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing explicit codes whose rate and distance match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the low-rate, high-distance regime. In 2017, Ta-Shma gave an explicit family of codes where every pair of codewords has relative distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$, with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)})$, matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound up to a factor of $\varepsilon^{o(1)}$. Ta-Shma's construction was based on starting with a good code and amplifying its bias with walks arising from the $s$-wide-replacement product.
  In this work, we give an arguably simpler almost-optimal construction, based on what we call free expander walks: ordinary expander walks where each step is taken on a distinct expander from a carefully chosen sequence. This sequence of expanders is derived from the construction of near-$X$-Ramanujan graphs due to O'Donnell and Wu.</description>

      <title>An Eventown Result for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of permutations $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is even-cycle-intersecting if $\sigma \pi^{-1}$ has an even cycle for all $\sigma,\pi \in \mathcal{F}$. We show that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is an even-cycle-intersecting family of permutations, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq 2^{n-1}$, and that equality holds when $n$ is a power of 2 and $\mathcal{F}$ is a double-translate of a Sylow 2-subgroup of $S_n$. This result can be seen as an analogue of the classical eventown problem for subsets and it confirms a conjecture of J\'anos K\"orner on maximum reversing families of the symmetric group. Along the way, we show that the canonically intersecting families of $S_n$ are also the extremal odd-cycle-intersecting families of $S_n$ for all even $n$. While the latter result has less combinatorial significance, its proof uses an interesting new character-theoretic identity that might be of independent interest in algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ of diameter 3 we can decide if $G$ is $3$-colourable in time $2^{O(n^{2/3-\varepsilon})}$ for any $\varepsilon &lt; 1/33$. This improves on the previous best algorithm of $2^{O((n\log n)^{2/3})}$ from D\k{e}bski, Piecyk and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [Faster 3-coloring of small-diameter graphs, ESA 2021].</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions and concentration inequalities for hypergraph colorings in the local lemma regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for $q$-colorings in $k$-uniform hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, if $k\ge 50$ and $q\ge 700\Delta^{\frac{5}{k-10}}$, there is a "Lee-Yang" zero-free strip around the interval $[0,1]$ of the partition function, which includes the special case of uniform enumeration of hypergraph colorings. As an immediate consequence, we obtain Berry-Esseen type inequalities for hypergraph $q$-colorings under such conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic normality for the size of any color class in a uniformly random coloring. Our framework also extends to the study of "Fisher zeros", leading to deterministic algorithms for approximating the partition function in the zero-free region.
  Our approach is based on extending the recent work of [Liu, Wang, Yin, Yu, STOC 2025] to general constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). We focus on partition functions defined for CSPs by introducing external fields to the variables. A key component in our approach is a projection-lifting scheme, which enables us to essentially lift information percolation type analysis for Markov chains from the real line to the complex plane. Last but not least, we also show a Chebyshev-type inequality under the sampling LLL condition for atomic CSPs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallel $(\Delta+1)$-Edge-Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring problem in the parallel $\left(\mathrm{PRAM}\right)$ model of computation. The celebrated Vizing's theorem [Viz64] states that every simple graph $G = (V,E)$ can be properly $(\Delta+1)$-edge-colored. In a seminal paper, Karloff and Shmoys [KS87] devised a parallel algorithm with time $O\left(\Delta^5\cdot\log n\cdot\left(\log^3 n+\Delta^2\right)\right)$ and $O(m\cdot\Delta)$ processors. This result was improved by Liang et al. [LSH96] to time $O\left(\Delta^{4.5}\cdot \log^3\Delta\cdot \log n + \Delta^4 \cdot\log^4 n\right)$ and $O\left(n\cdot\Delta^{3} +n^2\right)$ processors. [LSH96] claimed $O\left(\Delta^{3.5} \cdot\log^3\Delta\cdot \log n + \Delta^3\cdot \log^4 n\right)$ time, but we point out a flaw in their analysis, which once corrected, results in the above bound. We devise a faster parallel algorithm for this fundamental problem. Specifically, our algorithm uses $O\left(\Delta^4\cdot \log^4 n\right)$ time and $O(m\cdot \Delta)$ processors. Another variant of our algorithm requires $O\left(\Delta^{4+o(1)}\cdot\log^2 n\right)$ time, and $O\left(m\cdot\Delta\cdot\log n\cdot\log^{\delta}\Delta\right)$ processors, for an arbitrarily small $\delta&gt;0$. We also devise a few other tradeoffs between the time and the number of processors, and devise an improved algorithm for graphs with small arboricity. On the way to these results, we also provide a very fast parallel algorithm for updating $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring. Our algorithm for this problem is dramatically faster and simpler than the previous state-of-the-art algorithm (due to [LSH96]) for this problem.</description>

      <title>Basis Number and Pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results relating the basis number of a graph $G$ to path decompositions of $G$. Our first result shows that the basis number of a graph is at most four times its pathwidth. Our second result shows that, if a graph $G$ has a path decomposition with adhesions of size at most $k$ in which the graph induced by each bag has basis number at most $b$, then $G$ has basis number at most $b+O(k\log^2 k)$. The first result, combined with recent work of Geniet and Giocanti shows that the basis number of a graph is bounded by a polynomial function of its treewidth. The second result (also combined with the work of Geniet and Giocanti) shows that every $K_t$-minor-free graph has a basis number bounded by a polynomial function of $t$.</description>

      <title>Achievable Burning Densities of Growing Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph burning is a discrete-time process on graphs where vertices are sequentially activated and burning vertices cause their neighbours to burn over time. In this work, we focus on a dynamic setting in which the graph grows over time, and at each step we burn vertices in the growing grid $G_n = [-f(n),f(n)]^2$. We investigate the set of achievable burning densities for functions of the form $f(n)=\lceil cn^\alpha\rceil$, where $\alpha \ge 1$ and $c&gt;0$. We show that for $\alpha=1$, the set of achievable densities is $[1/(2c^2),1]$, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, every density in $[0,1]$ is achievable, and for $\alpha=3/2$, the set of achievable densities is $[0,(1+\sqrt{6}c)^{-2}]$.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances between ERGMs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are random graph models under which the presence of certain small structures (such as triangles) is encouraged; they can be constructed by tilting an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model by the exponential of a particular nonlinear Hamiltonian. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for subgraph counts [CD13]. However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. 
  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a "triangle-free" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well. Along the way, we also prove a bound on the marginal edge probability under the ERGM via a new bootstrapping argument. Such a bound has already appeared [FLSW25], but again only in the subcritical regime and using a different proof strategy.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Coordinated Motion Planning: Minimizing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of a generalization of the coordinated motion planning problem on graphs, where the goal is to route a specified subset of a given set of $k$ robots to their destinations with the aim of minimizing the total energy (i.e., the total length traveled). We develop novel techniques to push beyond previously-established results that were restricted to solid grids.
  We design a fixed-parameter additive approximation algorithm for this problem parameterized by $k$ alone. This result, which is of independent interest, allows us to prove the following two results pertaining to well-studied coordinated motion planning problems: (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$, for routing a single robot to its destination while avoiding the other robots, which is related to the famous Rush-Hour Puzzle; and (2) a fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$ plus the treewidth of the input graph, for the standard \textsc{Coordinated Motion Planning} (CMP) problem in which we need to route all the $k$ robots to their destinations. The latter of these results implies, among others, the fixed-parameter tractability of CMP parameterized by $k$ on graphs of bounded outerplanarity, which include bounded-height subgrids.
  We complement the above results with a lower bound which rules out the fixed-parameter tractability for CMP when parameterized by the total energy. This contrasts the recently-obtained tractability of the problem on solid grids under the same parameterization. As our final result, we strengthen the aforementioned fixed-parameter tractability to hold not only on solid grids but all graphs of bounded local treewidth -- a class including, among others, all graphs of bounded genus.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetric traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to illustrate the structure properties of the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with the set of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex paths) in one corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has certain frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $2(n-3)$. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the average case. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths increases according to $i\in [4, n]$ or keeps stable if it decreases from $i$ to $i+1\leq n$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge reaches its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For each ordinary edge out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$, respectively, in the average case. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq 2i_d$ where $i_d$ is the smallest number meeting the condition $\frac{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-2)(i_d-3)}{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-1)(i_d-2)} \geq \sqrt{1 + \frac{2}{i_d(i_d+1)}}$ and $i_d = O(n^{\frac{4}{7}})$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^2i_d^42^{2i_d})$ time using dynamic programming. The experiments are executed to verify these findings with the benchmark $TSP$ instances.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any planar convex body C there is a positive integer m with the property that any finite point set P in the plane can be three-colored such that there is no translate of C containing at least m points of P, all of the same color. As a part of the proof, we show a strengthening of the Erd\H{o}s-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow conjecture. Surprisingly, the proof also relies on the two dimensional case of the Illumination conjecture.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

Abstract: We study the trade-off between (average) spread and width in tree decompositions, answering several questions from Wood [arXiv:2509.01140]. The spread of a vertex $v$ in a tree decomposition is the number of bags that contain $v$. Wood asked for which $c&gt;0$, there exists $c'$ such that each graph $G$ has a tree decomposition of width $c\cdot tw(G)$ in which each vertex $v$ has spread at most $c'(d(v)+1)$. We show that $c\geq 2$ is necessary and that $c&gt;3$ is sufficient. Moreover, we answer a second question fully by showing that near-optimal average spread can be achieved simultaneously with width $O(tw(G))$.</description>
