      <title>Design, fabrication and test of parallel-coupled slow-wave high-gradient structure for ultrashort input power pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsinghua University has designed an X-band (11.424 GHz) slow-wave parallel-coupling accelerating structure, and demonstrated the high performance of the over-coupled structure operating with ultrashort pulse. In this study, we redesigned a 40-ns structure with 10 cells, tailored to the specifications of a high-power experimental platform, and provided a detailed analysis of the experimental results. Unexpected bead-pull results were observed during the cold testing, which we attribute to inter-cavity coupling. To explain these results, a multi-cell coupling circuit model was proposed and analyzed. High-power testing was conducted on the TPOT-X platform, and the highest gradient achieved was 130 MV/m after $1.1*10^7$ conditioning pulses. Compared to conventional multi-cavity high-gradient structures, the distributed power feeding system offers a shorter conditioning period and demonstrates the potential to achieve higher accelerating gradients under short-pulse operation.</description>

      <title>High performance beam transport with multi-stage acceleration system and its application to plasma potential measurement in fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accelerators, ion beams are often accelerated using electrostatic accelerating tubes. This paper reports on a method to improve the beam transport efficiency without adding new components to the beam transport system. High beam currents often suffer from a beam loss in a transport line. When Au negative ion beams are injected into a tandem accelerator, numerical simulations of low-energy ion beam transport have found that the beam loss increases significantly when the Au or Cu negative ion beam current exceeds 100 ${\mu}$A due to space-charge effects. We found that the transport efficiency is significantly improved by remaining constant beam energy accelerated at the multi-stage accelerator tube and by providing an electrostatic lens effect. In the heavy ion beam probe system (HIBP) system of the Large Helical Device (LHD) for plasma potential measurement, the negative ion beam current injected into the tandem accelerator could be increased by a factor of 3.6. As a result, the output of Au$^+$ beam current at the tandem accelerator used to measure the LHD plasma potential was increased from about 3 ${\mu}$A to 12$ {\mu}$A and it was demonstrated that the average electron density in the plasma could be measured up to $1.75\times10^{19}m^{-3}$. This method is effective and widely applicable to improve the performance of low-energy heavy-ion beam transport systems output from the first stage of tandem accelerators and ion sources by adding a lens effect to the multi-stage accelerator tubes.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective time-stretch terahertz recorders using 1550 nm probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-stretch electro-optic detection allows THz waveforms to be recorded in single-shot, up to Megahertz acquisition rates. This capability is required in accelerator physics, and also opens new applications in table-top THz time-domain spectroscopy. However, the technique has also been notoriously known for the need of high speed -- and high cost -- ADCs or oscilloscopes for the readout. Furthermore, the resulting cost considerably increases with the number of samples that is needed per THz waveform, an issue that has severely limited the widespread of the technique so far. In this article, we show that particularly cost-effective designs can be obtained by using 1550~nm probes. We present the performances of an experimental design, that uses only standard components (including dispersive devices), and a standard commercial probe laser without additional pulse broadening. In these conditions, our time-stretch system could already record coherent THz pulses at the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility, over an unprecedented number of samples, using oscilloscopes and ADC boards with only 1-3 GHz bandwidth.</description>
