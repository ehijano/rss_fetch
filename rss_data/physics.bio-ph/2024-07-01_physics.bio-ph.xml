      <title>Automated 1D Helmholtz coil design for cell biology: Weak magnetic fields alter cytoskeleton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than fifty years, scientists have been gathering evidence of the biological impacts of weak magnetic fields. However, the lack of systematics in experimental studies has hampered research progress on this subject. To systematically quantify magnetic field effects in cell biology, it is crucial to produce fields that can be automatically adjusted and that are stable throughout an experiment's duration, usually operating inside an incubator. Here, we report on the design of a fully automated 1D Helmholtz coil setup that is internally water cooled, thus eliminating any confounding effects caused by temperature fluctuations. The coils also allow cells to be exposed to magnetic fields from multiple directions through automated controlled rotation. Preliminary data, acquired with the coils placed inside an incubator and on a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, confirm previous reports that both microtubule and actin polymerization and dynamics are altered by weak magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Glycocalyx Cleavage Boosts Erythrocytes Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glycocalyx is a complex layer of carbohydrate and protein molecules that surrounds the cell membrane of many types of mammalian cells. It serves several important functions, including cell adhesion and communication, and maintain cell shape and stability, especially in the case of erythrocytes. Alteration of glycocalyx composition represents a cardiovascular health threatening. For example, in diabetes mellitus glycocalyx of erythrocytes and of endothelial cells is known to be impaired, a potential source of blood occlusion in microcirculation, which may lead to blindness, and renal failure of patients. The impact of glycocalyx impairment on erythrocyte aggregation remains a largely unexplored research area. We conduct here in vitro-experiments in microfluidic devices in order to investigate erythrocytes aggregation incubated with amylase, an enzyme that partially breaks down glycocalyx molecules. It is found that incubation of erythrocytes by amylase leads to a dramatic increase of their aggregation and stability and alters the aggregates morphologies. Confocal microscopy analysis reveals a significant degradation of the glycocalyx layer, correlated with enhanced erythrocytes aggregation. An increased erythrocyte aggregation in vivo should affect oxygen and other metabolites delivery to organs and tissues. This study brings new elements about elucidation of microscopic origins of erythrocyte aggregation and their potential impact on cardiovascular pathologies.</description>

      <title>Biophysical effects and neuromodulatory dose of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) has the potential to usher in a new era for human neuroscience by allowing spatially precise and high-resolution non-invasive targeting of both deep and superficial brain regions. Currently, fundamental research on the mechanisms of interaction between ultrasound and neural tissues is progressing in parallel with application-focused research. However, a major hurdle in the wider use of TUS is the selection of optimal parameters to enable safe and effective neuromodulation in humans. In this paper, we will discuss the major factors that determine both the safety and efficacy of TUS. We will discuss the thermal and mechanical biophysical effects of ultrasound, which underlie its biological effects, in the context of their relationships with tunable parameters. Based on this knowledge of biophysical effects, and drawing on concepts from radiotherapy, we propose a framework for conceptualising TUS dose.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data in the case of a planar cluster. Then, we extended it for three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, the non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and the power-law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters in the function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely permeability and tortuosity of bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Different relative scalings between transient forces and thermal fluctuations tune regimes of chromatin organization</title>

Abstract: Within the nucleus, structural maintenance of chromosome protein complexes, namely condensin and cohesin, create an architecture to facilitate the organization and proper function of the genome. Condensin, in addition to performing loop extrusion, creates localized clusters of chromatin in the nucleolus through transient crosslinks. Large-scale simulations revealed three different dynamic behaviors as a function of timescale: slow crosslinking leads to no clusters, fast crosslinking produces rigid slowly changing clusters, while intermediate timescales produce flexible clusters that mediate gene interaction. By mathematically analyzing different relative scalings of the two sources of stochasticity, thermal fluctuations and the force induced by the transient crosslinks, we predict these three distinct regimes of cluster behavior. Standard time-averaging that takes the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force to zero predicts the existence of rigid clusters. Accounting for the interaction of both fluctuations from the crosslinks and thermal noise with an effective energy landscape predicts the timescale-dependent lifetimes of flexible clusters. No clusters are predicted when the fluctuations of the transient crosslink force are taken to be large relative to thermal fluctuations. This mathematical perturbation analysis illuminates the importance of accounting for stochasticity in local incoherent transient forces to predict emergent complex biological behavior.</description>

      <title>Gene activity fully predicts transcriptional bursting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcription commonly occurs in bursts, with alternating productive (ON) and quiescent (OFF) periods, governing mRNA production rates. Yet, how transcription is regulated through bursting dynamics remains unresolved. Here, we conduct real-time measurements of endogenous transcriptional bursting with single-mRNA sensitivity. Leveraging the diverse transcriptional activities in early fly embryos, we uncover stringent relationships between bursting parameters. Specifically, we find that the durations of ON and OFF periods are linked. Regardless of the developmental stage or body-axis position, gene activity levels predict individual alleles' average ON and OFF periods. Lowly transcribing alleles predominantly modulate OFF periods (burst frequency), while highly transcribing alleles primarily tune ON periods (burst size). These relationships persist even under perturbations of cis-regulatory elements or trans-factors and account for bursting dynamics measured in other species. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic constraint governing bursting dynamics rather than a modular control of distinct parameters by distinct regulatory processes.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular automaton model with heterogeneous cell sizes predicts epithelial colony growth</title>

Abstract: Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.</description>
