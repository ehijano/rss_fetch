      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit from general mixtures of experts to quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of Mixture of Experts (MoE) trained via gradient flow on supervised learning problems. Our main result establishes the propagation of chaos for a MoE as the number of experts diverges. We demonstrate that the corresponding empirical measure of their parameters is close to a probability measure that solves a nonlinear continuity equation, and we provide an explicit convergence rate that depends solely on the number of experts. We apply our results to a MoE generated by a quantum neural network.</description>

      <title>Learning the Optimal Hydrodynamic Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in extremely close alignment with the Shakhov kinetic model and DSMC data, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>Interaction energies in nematic liquid crystal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, as $\rho\to 0$, an asymptotic expansion for the minimal Dirichlet energy of $\mathbb S^2$-valued maps outside a finite number of three-dimensional particles of size $\rho$ with fixed centers $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$, under general anchoring conditions at the particle boundaries. Up to a scaling factor, this expansion is of the form \begin{align*} E_\rho = \sum_j \mu_j -4\pi\rho \sum_{i\neq j} \frac{\langle v_i,v_j\rangle}{|x_i-x_j|} +o(\rho)\,, \end{align*} where $\mu_j$ is the minimal energy after zooming in at scale $\rho$ around each particle, and $v_j\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is a torque determined by the far-field behavior of the corresponding single-particle minimizer. The above expansion highlights Coulomb-like interactions between the particle centers. This agrees with the \textit{electrostatics analogy} commonly used in the physics literature for colloid interactions in nematic liquid crystal. That analogy was pioneered by Brochard and de Gennes in 1970, based on a formal linearization argument. We obtain here for the first time a precise estimate of the energy error introduced by this linearization procedure.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X=[(\mathbb C^r\setminus Z)/G]$ be a toric Fano orbifold. We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of any $G$-equivariant line bundle on $\mathbb C^r$ with respect to certain choice of parameters. This gives the quantum cohomology central charge of the corresponding line bundle on $\mathcal X$, while in the oscillatory integral expression it becomes the oscillatory integral in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg mirror of $\mathcal X$. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with a generalization of the superadiabatic projectors method. In a general framework, the well-known superadiabatic projectors are constructed and accurately described in the case of rank one, when a remarkable factorization occurs. We apply these ideas to spectral theory and we explain how our abstract results allow to recover or improve recent results about the semiclassical magnetic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Edge Universality of Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mesoscopic fluctuations at edges of orthogonal polynomial ensembles with both continuous and discrete measures. Our main result is a Central limit Theorem (CLT) for linear statistics at mesoscopic scales. We show that if the recurrence coefficients for the associated orthogonal polynomials are slowly varying, a universal CLT holds. Our primary tool is the resolvent for the truncated Jacobi matrices associated with the orthogonal polynomials. While the Combes-Thomas estimate has been successful in obtaining bulk mesoscopic fluctuations in the literature, it is too rough at the edges. Instead, we prove an estimate for the resolvent of Jacobi matrices with slowly varying entries. Particular examples to which our CLT applies are Jacobi, Laguerre and Gaussian unitary ensembles as well as discrete ensembles from random tilings.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the foundations of the local linear symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $p$-adic analytic symplectic $4$-dimensional manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local linear models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices, which we show can be generalized to $p$-adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local linear models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. Although the paper deals mostly with matrices and systems whose singularities are non-degenerate, we include several classifications in the degenerate $p$-adic case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. The paper also includes a number of results concerning symplectic linear algebra over arbitrary fields in arbitrary dimensions as well as applications to $p$-adic mechanical systems and singularity theory for $p$-adic analytic maps on $4$-manifolds. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants.</description>

      <title>Homoenergetic solutions for the Rayleigh-Boltzmann equation: existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a particular class of solutions of the linear Boltzmann-Rayleigh equation, known in the nonlinear setting as Homoenergetic solutions. These solutions describe the dynamics of Boltzmann gases under the effect of different mechanical deformations. Therefore, the long-time behaviour of these solutions cannot be described by Maxwellian distributions and it strongly depends on the homogeneity of the collision kernel of the equation. Here we focus on the paradigmatic case of simple shear deformations and in the case of cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity $\gamma\geq 0$, in particular covering the case of Maxwell molecules (i.e. $\gamma=0$) and hard potentials with $0\leq \gamma &lt;1$. We first prove a well-posedness result for this class of solutions in the space of non-negative Radon measures and then we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the shear deformation. In the case of Maxwell molecules we prove that there is a different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter.</description>

Abstract: The common cause completeness (CCC) is a philosophical principle that asserts that if we consider two positively correlated events then it evokes a common cause. The principle is due to H. Reichenbach and has been largely studied in Boolean algebras and elsewhere.The results published so far bring about a question whether there is a small (countable) Boolean algebra with CCC. In this note we construct such an example.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the number of sign and level-set clusters of the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the limiting fluctuations of the number of sign and level-set clusters of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 3$, that are contained in a large domain. In dimension $d \ge 4$ we prove that the fluctuations are Gaussian at all non-critical levels, while in dimension $d=3$ we show that fluctuations may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian depending on the level. We also show that the sign clusters experience a form of Berry cancellation in all dimensions, that is, the fluctuations of the sign cluster count is suppressed compared to generic levels.
  Our proof is based on controlling the Weiner-It\^{o} chaos expansion of the cluster count using percolation theoretic inputs; to our knowledge this is the first time that chaos expansion techniques have been applied to analyse a non-local functional of a strongly correlated Gaussian field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald finite-difference Hamiltonian is lifted to a super-generalization. In addition to canonical bosonic time variables $p_k$ new Grassmann time variables $\theta_k$ are introduced, and the Hamiltonian is represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $\theta_k$. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald polynomials discussed earlier in the literature. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances and divergences of order $p$ by quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem introduced in [De Palma and Trevisan, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] where quantum channels realize the transport. Relying on this general machinery, we introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization of our previous result in this direction.</description>

      <title>Finite-time singularity formations for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct finite time blow-up solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) from ${\mathbb R}^2$ into $S^2$ \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t= a(\Delta u+|\nabla u|^2u) -b u\wedge \Delta u &amp;\ \mbox{ in }\ {\mathbb R}^2\times(0,T), u(\cdot,0) = u_0\in S^2 &amp;\ \mbox{ in }\ {\mathbb R}^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a^2+b^2=1,~a &gt; 0,~ b\in {\mathbb R}$. Given any prescribed $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and small $T&gt;0$, we prove that there exists regular initial data such that the solution blows up precisely at these points at finite time $t=T$, taking around each point the profile of sharply scaled degree 1 harmonic map with the type II blow-up speed \begin{equation*} \| \nabla u\|_{L^\infty } \sim \frac{|\ln(T-t)|^2}{ T-t } \ \mbox{ as } \ t\to T. \end{equation*} The proof is based on the {\em parabolic inner-outer gluing method}, developed in \cite{17HMF} for Harmonic Map Flow (HMF). However, a direct consequence of the presence of dispersion is the {\em lack of maximum principle} for suitable quantities, which makes the analysis more delicate even at the linearized level. To overcome this difficulty, we make use of two key technical ingredients: first, for the inner problem we employ the tool of {\em distorted Fourier transform}, as developed by Krieger, Miao, Schlag and Tataru \cite{Krieger09Duke,KMS20WM}. Second, the linear theory for the outer problem is achieved by means of the sub-Gaussian estimate for the fundamental solution of parabolic system in non-divergence form with coefficients of Dini mean oscillation in space ($\mathsf{DMO_x}$), which was proved by Dong, Kim and Lee \cite{dong22-non-divergence} recently.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>The Widom-Sobolev formula for discontinuous matrix-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Widom-Sobolev formula for the asymptotic behaviour of truncated Wiener-Hopf operators with discontinuous matrix-valued symbols for three different classes of test functions. The symbols may depend on both position and momentum except when closing the asymptotics for twice differentiable test functions with H\"older singularities. The cut-off domains are allowed to have piecewise differentiable boundaries. In contrast to the case where the symbol is smooth in one variable, the resulting coefficient in the enhanced area law we obtain here remains as explicit for matrix-valued symbols as it is for scalar-valued symbols.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

Abstract: On the basis of the first principle -- the law of probability conservation and the Helmholtz decomposition theorem the authors have succeeded to construct the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, Dirac equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Maxwell equations. The approach described in this paper makes it possible to naturally connect the classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic 4-bracket algorithm for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified thermodynamic algorithm (UTA) is presented for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems, i.e., systems that have Hamiltonian and dissipative parts that conserve energy while producing entropy. The algorithm is based on the metriplectic 4-bracket given in Morrison and Updike [Phys.\ Rev.\ E 109, 045202 (2024)]. A feature of the UTA is the force-flux relation $\mathbf{J}^\alpha = - L^{\alpha\beta}\, \nabla(\delta H / \delta \xi^\beta)$ for phenomenological coefficients $L^{\alpha\beta}$, Hamiltonian $H$ and dynamical variables $\xi^\beta$. The algorithm is applied to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier, the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes, and and Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems, and significant generalizations of these systems are obtained.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSO), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V+\lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We focus on three specific RBSOs: the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Let $\Lambda_\Psi$ denote the strength of interaction between two neighboring blocks. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\epsilon$ for a small constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, under the condition $ W^{d/4}/\Lambda_\Psi\ll\lambda\ll 1$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result proved in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously establish an Anderson localization-delocalization transition of RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies.
  Our proof is based on a nontrivial extension of the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>
