      <title>Higher derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus and supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ignoring ten-dimensional heterotic gauge fields, heterotic supergravity reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus gives rise to a half-maximal supergravity coupled to $d$ vector multiplets. The reduced theory has a continuous $O(d,d;\mathbb R)/O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ symmetry that persists to all perturbative orders in the string $\alpha'$ expansion. We highlight this symmetry by explicitly reducing the bosonic sector of four-derivative heterotic supergravity as well as its fermionic supersymmetry variations. After appropriate field redefinitions, the resulting action and supersymmetry variations are manifestly $O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ invariant. This reduction allows us to explore the interplay between the gravity and vector multiplets beyond leading order, where (in our conventions) $O(d)_-$ is the supergravity R-symmetry while $O(d)_+$ is a flavor symmetry of the $d$ vector multiplets.</description>

      <title>The Penrose limit of the Weyl double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed the Penrose limit into the Weyl classical double copy. Thereby, we provide a lift of the double copy properties of plane wave spacetimes into black hole geometries and we open a novel avenue towards taking the classical double copy beyond statements about algebraically special backgrounds. In particular, the Penrose limit, viewed as the leading order Fermi coordinate expansion around a null geodesic, complements approaches leveraging asymptotic flatness such as the asymptotic Weyl double copy. Along the way, we show how our embedding of the Penrose limit within the Weyl double copy naturally fixes the functional ambiguity in the double copy for Petrov type N spacetimes. We also highlight the utility of a spinorial approach to the Penrose limit. In particular, we use this spinorial approach to derive a simple analytical expression for arbitrary Penrose limits of four-dimensional, vacuum type D spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Spacelike Splitting Amplitude for N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of collinear behavior for gauge theories in the spacelike region is of great phenomenological and theoretical importance. We analytically calculate the two-loop spacelike splitting amplitude for the full color N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory. The result is derived by two complementary methods starting from the known amplitude: one is based on a discontinuity analysis, while the other one is based on analytic continuation. Our result explicitly shows terms that violate naive factorization. However we show that factorization is restored at the level of color-summed unpolarized squared amplitudes at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order. We conjecture that the two-loop tripole terms in the generalized splitting amplitudes in QCD are identical to what we obtain in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>On type II string theory on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and symmetric orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in detail the $1+1$-dimensional superconformal field theory dual to type II string theory on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$, emphasizing the string theoretic aspects of this duality. For one unit of NS-NS 5-brane flux ($Q_5=1$), this string theory has been suggested to be dual to a grand-canonical ensemble of $T^{4N}/S_N$ free symmetric orbifold CFTs. We show how the string genus expansion emerges to all orders for the free orbifold grand-canonical correlation functions. We also discuss how the strong coupling limit of the NS-NS string theory arises (even at large $N$) in the free orbifold description, and argue why this limit does not have a weakly coupled R-R description. The dual CFT includes (for all values of $Q_5$) an extra $T^4$ factor that is decoupled from perturbative string theory. We discuss the exactly marginal deformations that relate the different values of $Q_5$, including the precise $J{\bar J}$ deformations mixing this extra $T^4$ with the symmetric orbifold.</description>

      <title>The Tropical Geometry of Subtraction Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction of local subtraction schemes through the lenses of tropical geometry. We focus on individual Feynman integrals in parametric presentation, and think of them as particular instances of Euler integrals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a combination of Euler integrands to be locally finite, i.e. to be expandable as a Taylor series in the exponent variables directly under sign of integration. We use this to construct a local subtraction scheme that is applicable to a class of Euler integrals that satisfy a certain geometric property. We apply this to compute the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ of various Feynman integrals involving both UV and IR singularities, as well as to generalizations of Feynman integrals that arise in effective field theories and in phase-space integrations.</description>

      <title>On small Dirac Neutrino Masses in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how tiny Dirac neutrino masses consistent with experimental constraints can arise in string theory SM-like vacua. We use as a laboratory 4d ${\cal N}=1$ type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifold compactifications, and in particular recent results on Yukawa couplings at infinite field-space distance. In this regime we find Dirac neutrino masses of the form $m_\nu \simeq g_\nu\langle H\rangle$, with $g_{\nu}$ the gauge coupling of the massive $U(1)$ under which the right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ are charged, and which should be in the range $g_{\nu}\simeq 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$ to reproduce neutrino data. The neutrino mass suppression occurs because the right-handed neutrino kinetic term behaves as $K_{\nu\nu} \simeq 1 /g_{\nu}^2 $. At the same time a tower of $\nu_R$-like states appears with characteristic scale $m_0\simeq g_{\nu}^2M_{\rm P}\simeq 0.1-500$ eV, in agreement with Swampland expectations. Two large hidden dimensions only felt by the $\nu_R$ sector arise at the same scale, while the string scale is around $M_s\simeq g_\nu M_{\rm P}\simeq 10-700$ TeV. Some phenomenological implications and model building challenges are described. As a byproduct, independently of the neutrino issue, we argue that a single large dimension in the context of SM-like type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifolds leads to too small Yukawa couplings for quarks and charged leptons.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes and Polarizations of Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes for a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pair creation out of the vacuum, for a system consisting of a massive Dirac field in $1+1$ dimensions, contained between a pair of perfectly reflecting boundaries, one of them oscillating. After analyzing some general properties of the vacuum-decay process, we evaluate the corresponding transition amplitude in a Magnus expansion of the S-matrix. We show how this yields, besides the single-pair creation amplitude, multipair ones, as well as corrections to the single pair amplitude.
  We also apply it to obtain an approximate, yet explicitly unitary expression for the Bogoliubov transformation between the in and out Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative RG for the Weak interaction corrections to the magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze, by rigorous Renormalization Group (RG) methods, a Fermi model for Weak forces with a single family of leptons, one massless and the other with mass $m=M e^{-\beta}$, with $M$ the gauge boson mass, a quartic non-local interaction with coupling $\lambda^2$ and a momentum cut-off $\Lambda$. The magnetic moment is written as a series in $\lambda^2$, with $n$-th coefficients bounded by $C^n ({m^2\over M^2}) \beta^{2n } ({\Lambda^2\over M^2})^{(1+0^+)(n-1)}$ if $C$ a constant; this implies convergence and provides non-perturbative bounds on the higher orders contribution. The fact that the magnetic moment is associated to a dimensionally irrelevant quantity requires the implementation of cancellations in the multiscale analysis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering and Beyond from Extreme Mass Ratio Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

Abstract: We present the new version of the FeynGrav. The package provides tools to operate with Feynman rules for quantum gravity within FeynCalc. The latest version improves package efficiency and implements new physical models. We discover recurrent relations between metric factors that enhance computational efficiency. We discuss gravitational interaction with Horndeski gravity, quadratic gravity, and the simplest axion-like coupling.

      <description>arXiv:2406.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After recasting the standard charged and uncharged brane profiles in the harmonic gauge, we explore solutions with the same isometries where the potentials $V = T \,e^{\gamma\,\phi}$ of ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings are taken into account. Combining a detailed catalog of the possible asymptotics with some numerical results suggests that these spherically symmetric backgrounds terminate at singularities within finite proper distances.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT correspondence for the $O(N)$ invariant critical $\varphi^4$ model in 3-dimensions by the conformal smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a structure of a 4-dimensional bulk space constructed from the $O(N)$ invariant critical $\varphi^4$ model in 3-dimension using the conformal smearing. We calculate a bulk metric corresponding to the information metric and the bulk-to-boundary propagator for a composite scalar field $\varphi^2$ in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the bulk metric describes an asymptotic AdS space at both UV (near boundary) and IR (deep in the bulk) limits, which correspond to the asymptotic free UV fixed point and the Wilson-Fischer IR fixed point of the 3-dimensional $\varphi^4$ model, respectively. The bulk-to-boundary scalar propagator, on the other hand, encodes $\Delta_{\varphi^2}$ (the conformal dimension of $\varphi^2$) into its $z$ (a coordinate in the extra direction of the AdS space) dependence. Namely it correctly reproduces not only $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=1$ at UV fixed point but also $\Delta_{\varphi^2}=2$ at the IR fixed point for the boundary theory. Moreover, we confirm consistency with the GKP-Witten relation in the interacting theory that the coefficient of the $z^{\Delta_{\varphi^2}}$ term in $z\to 0$ limit agrees exactly with the two-point function of $\varphi^2$ including an effect of the $\varphi^4$ interaction.</description>

      <title>Gribov Problem and Stochastic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard procedure for quantizing gauge fields is the Faddeev-Popov quantization, which performs gauge fixing in the path integral formulation and introduces additional ghost fields. This approach provides the foundation for calculations in quantum Yang-Mills theory. However, in 1978, Vladimir Gribov showed that the gauge-fixing procedure was incomplete, with residual gauge copies (called Gribov copies) still entering the path integral even after gauge fixing. These copies impact the infrared behavior of the theory and modify gauge-dependent quantities, such as gluon and ghost propagators, as they represent redundant integrations over gauge-equivalent configurations. Furthermore, their existence breaks down the Faddeev-Popov prescription at a fundamental level. To partially resolve this, Gribov proposed restricting the path integral to the Gribov region, which alters the gluon propagator semiclassically in a way that points to gluon confinement in the Yang-Mills theory.
  In this thesis, we comprehensively study the Gribov problem analytically. After reviewing Faddeev-Popov quantization, the BRST symmetry of the complete Lagrangian and the Gribov problem in depth, we detail Gribov's semi-classical resolution involving restriction of the path integral to the Gribov region, outlining its effects on the theory. Further, we elucidate stochastic quantization prescription for quantizing the gauge fields. This alternate quantization prescription hints towards a formalism devoid of the Gribov problem, making it an interesting candidate for quantizing and studying the non-perturbative regime of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Null Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce null contractions of the Poincare and relativistic conformal algebras. The longitudinal null contraction involves writing the algebra in lightcone coordinates and contracting one of the null directions. For the Poincare algebra, this yields two non-overlapping co-dimension one Carroll algebras. The transverse contraction is a limit on the spatial dimensions and yields two non-overlapping co-dimension one Galilean algebras. We find, similar to Susskind's original observation of the non-relativistic case, that the Poincare algebra, written in the lightcone coordinates, naturally contains Carrollian sub-algebras in one lower dimension. The effect of the longitudinal contraction, which essentially focusses on the null direction, is to disentangle the two Carroll algebras that now correspond to the symmetries of the two null boundaries. The transverse contraction similarly separates the overlapping Galilean sub-algebras of the original Poincare algebra. We discuss aspects of the conformal case, where we get lower dimensional Carroll Conformal algebras and Schrodinger algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field {\xi} be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and {\xi} contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for F(Riemann) gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another {\xi} independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in F(Riemann) gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

Abstract: In Gepner's pioneering work, the requirement that leads to a model having the desired $N=1$ Spacetime supersymmetry and $E(8)\times E(6)$ Gauge symmetry was the requirement that the spacetime symmetry is compatible with modular invariance. In this work we show that the requirement for the simultaneous fulfillment of mutual locality of the left-moving vertices of physical states with the space-time symmetry generators and of right-moving vertices with generators of $E(8)\times E(6)$-gauge symmetry, which arises after some special reduction together with the requirement of mutual locality of complete (left-right) vertices of physical states among themselves leads to the same Gepner models.</description>

      <title>Perturbative versus Non-Perturbative Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximated functional renormalization group (FRG) equations lead to regulator-dependent $\beta$-functions, in analogy to the scheme-dependence of the perturbative renormalization group (pRG) approach. A scheme transformation redefines the couplings to relate the $\beta$-functions of the FRG method with an arbitrary regulator function to the pRG ones obtained in a given scheme. Here, we consider a periodic sine-Gordon scalar field theory in $d=2$ dimensions and show that the relation of the FRG and pRG approaches is intricate. Although, both the FRG and the pRG methods are known to be sufficient to obtain the critical frequency $\beta_c^2 =8\pi$ of the model independently of the choice of the regulator and the renormalization scheme, we show that one has to go beyond the standard pRG method (e.g., using an auxiliary mass term) or the Coulomb-gas representation in order to obtain the $\beta$-function of the wave function renormalization. This aspect makes the scheme transformation non-trivial. Comparing flow equations of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon theory without any scheme-transformation, i.e., redefinition of couplings, we find that the auxiliary mass pRG $\beta$-functions of the minimal subtraction scheme can be recovered within the FRG approach with the choice of the power-law regulator with $b=2$, therefore constitutes a preferred choice for the comparison of FRG and pRG flows.</description>

      <title>Second order bosonic string effective action from $O(d,d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corrections to the tree-level effective action for the bosonic string up to second order in $\alpha'$ are fixed by requiring its dimensional reduction to $26-d$ dimensions to be compatible with $O(d,d)$ symmetry. The result is in agreement with the literature, but takes a simpler form than previously know expressions. We identify some structures in the Lagrangian which appear at least at the first three orders in $\alpha'$.</description>

      <title>Tree-level $R^4$ correction from $O(d,d)$: NS-NS five-point terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tree-level string effective action reduced from $D$ to $D-d$ dimensions possesses a continuous $O(d,d)$ symmetry, closely related to T-duality. A necessary condition for a higher derivative correction to preserve this symmetry is that certain $O(d,d)$ violating terms which appear in the dimensional reduction have to cancel out. We use this idea to complete the quartic Riemann correction with all terms involving five NS-NS sector fields. The resulting Lagrangian is considerably simpler than expressions that have previously appeared in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of first-order phase transitions in strongly coupled systems are relevant in a variety of systems, from heavy ion collisions to the early universe. Holographic theories can be used to model these systems, with fluctuations usually suppressed. In this case the system can come close to a spinodal point where theory and experiments indicate that the the behaviour should be similar to a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We study this question using a simple holographic model and confirm that there is critical slowing down and scaling behaviour close to the spinodal point, with precise quantitative estimates. In addition, we determine the start of the scaling regime for the breakdown of quasistatic evolution when the temperature of a thermal bath is slowly decreased across the transition. We also extend the analysis to the dynamics of second-order phase transitions and strong crossovers.</description>

      <title>Massive IIA flux compactifications with dynamical open strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider massive type IIA compactifications down to 4 dimensions in presence of O6 planes and D6 branes parallel to them, in order to preserve half-maximal supersymmetry in 4D. The dynamics of open strings living on the spacetime filling branes is taken into account, in the gauged supergravity description, by adding extra vector multiplets and embedding tensor components. The scalar potential gets new terms that can be matched with contributions coming from dimensional reduction of the non-Abelian DBI and WZ brane actions. In this setting, we analyze the vacuum structure of the theory and find novel AdS$_4$ vacua, both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric ones. Furthermore, we address their perturbative stability by computing their mass spectra. Some of the vacua are found to be perturbatively stable, despite their being non-supersymmetric. We conclude by discussing the reliability of our setup in terms of higher-derivative corrections.</description>

Abstract: Analogue Hawking radiation from acoustic horizons is now a well-established phenomenon, both theoretically and experimentally. Its persistence, despite the modified dispersion relations characterising analogue models, has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the robustness of this phenomenon against ultraviolet modifications of our spacetime description. However, previous theoretical approaches, such as the Bogoliubov transformation relating asymptotic states, have somewhat lacked a straightforward physical intuition regarding the origin of this robustness and its limits of applicability. To address this, we revisit analogue Hawking radiation using the tunneling method. We present a unified treatment that allows us to consider flows with and without acoustic horizons and with superluminal or subluminal dispersion relations. This approach clarifies the fundamental mechanism behind the resilience of Hawking radiation in these settings and explains the puzzling occurrence of excitations even in subcritical (supercritical) flows with subluminal (superluminal) dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>On the Thermodynamics of Continuous Spin photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Special relativity allows massless particles to have states of different integer (or half-integer) helicities that mix under boosts, much like the spin-states of a massive particle. Such massless particles are known as continuous spin particles (CSPs), a term coined by Wigner, and they are notable for their infinite tower of spin polarizations. The mixing under boosts is controlled by a spin-scale $\rho$ with units of momentum. Normally, we assume $\rho=0$. The interactions of CSPs are known to satisfy certain simple properties, one of which is that the $\rho \rightarrow 0$ limit generically recovers familiar interactions of massless scalars, photons, or gravitons, with all other polarizations decoupling in this limit. Thus, one can ask if the photon of the Standard Model is a CSP at small but non-zero $\rho$. One concern about this possibility -- originally raised by Wigner -- is that the infinite tower of polarizations could pose problems for thermodynamics. To address this question, we study the thermal evolution of a CSP photon gas coupled to isothermal matter, across CSP helicity modes and phase space. We find that the structure of the interactions dictated by Lorentz symmetry imply well behaved thermodynamics. When the CSP photon's interactions to charged matter are turned on, the primary $h=\pm 1$ helicity modes thermalize quickly, while the other modes require increasingly long time-scales to thermalize, set by powers of $T/\rho$. In familiar thermal systems, the CSP photon behaves like the QED photon with small $\rho$- and time- dependent corrections to its effective relativistic degrees of freedom. Sizable departures from familiar thermal behavior arise at energy scales comparable to $\rho$ and could have testable experimental consequences.</description>

Abstract: We show that particle detectors coupled to a massless quantum field through its derivative can genuinely harvest entanglement form the field even when they are in causal contact in flat spacetime. This is particularly relevant since the derivative coupling model captures some interesting experimentally realizable systems and since the harvested entanglement peaks at full light contact.</description>

      <title>Stirring the false vacuum via interacting quantized bubbles on a 5564-qubit quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay is a potential mechanism governing the evolution of the early Universe, with profound connections to non-equilibrium quantum physics, including quenched dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative character of the false vacuum decay and the scarcity of its experimental probes make the effect notoriously difficult to study, with many basic open questions, such as how the bubbles of true vacuum form, move and interact with each other. Here we utilize a quantum annealer with 5564 superconducting flux qubits to directly observe quantized bubble formation in real time -- the hallmark of false vacuum decay dynamics. Moreover, we develop an effective model that describes the initial bubble creation and subsequent interaction effects. We demonstrate that the effective model remains accurate in the presence of dissipation, showing that our annealer can access coherent scaling laws in driven many-body dynamics of 5564 qubits for over $1\mu$s, i.e., more than 1000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work sets the stage for exploring late-time dynamics of the false vacuum at computationally intractable system sizes, dimensionality, and topology in quantum annealer platforms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish that a four-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetime containing a massive particle sphere is isometric to the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our results expand upon existing uniqueness theorems for static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes, which focus on scenarios featuring event horizons or photon spheres. Similarly to the uniqueness theorems concerning photon spheres or event horizons, only a single massive particle sphere is sufficient to obtain a unique solution. However, in contrast to previous theorems, our result leads to the existence of an entire spacetime foliation sliced by a set of massive particle spheres spanning various energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description for the driven-dissipative dynamics of the entanglement negativity, which quantifies the genuine entanglement in mixed-state systems. We focus on quantum quenches in fermionic and bosonic systems subject to linear dissipation, as described by quadratic Lindblad master equations. In the spirit of hydrodynamics, we divide the system into mesoscopic cells. At early times, correlations are generated in each cell by the unitary component of the evolution. Correlations are then transported across different cells via ballistic quasiparticle propagation, while simultaneously evolving under the action of the environment. We show that in the hydrodynamic limit the negativity can be reconstructed from the correlations between the independently propagating quasiparticles. We benchmark our approach considering quenches from both homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial states in the Kitaev chain, the tight-binding chain, and the harmonic chain in the presence of gain/loss dissipation.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We apply the BdG formalism to compute the wavefunctions of the subgap Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit, in a piecewise-continuous manner. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result is different from the S-B-S set-ups in graphene and Weyl semimetals (each featuring twofold-degenerate nodal points), where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. Although the three bands of the triple-point fermions comprise a nondispersive flat band, the multifold nature of the bandstructure is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction, contributed by the two pairs of ABSs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have exclusively employed the linear stability analysis at ultra-high boost on two well-known stable-causal theories - second-order MIS and first-order BDNK, to identify the region of parameter space over which they are frame-invariantly stable and obey causal signal propagation. It has been shown that at near-luminal boost, stability criteria alone can provide the causality constraints on transport coefficients, which are identical to the asymptotic causality conditions, without actually going to the asymptotic limit of the theories. Thus, we present an alternative approach to derive the causality constraints, which is more appropriate for low-energy effective theories like relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering of massive fermions off of smooth, spherically symmetric monopoles in $4d$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory. We propose a complete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses all angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a monopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of the Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a dyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then protected from decay by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry, creating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can be trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which can decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can be described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert space, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov effect.</description>

      <title>The effect of Skyrme--Chern-Simons dynamics on gauged Skyrmions in $2+1$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Skyrmion of the $SO(2)$ gauged $O(3)$ sigma model in $2+1$ dimensions in the presence of a Skyrme--Chern-Simons (SCS) term, and compare its properties with the corresponding properties of the Skyrmion in the presence of the usual Chern-Simons (CS) term. We find that these properties are qualitatively largely similar in both cases, meaning that the SCS density can be employed as an alternative to the CS term also in higher dimensions, most importantly in even dimensions where no CS term is defined, $e.g.,$ in $3+1$ dimensions. The SCS density employed here is defined in terms of the pair of $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ gauge fields and an auxiliary $O(5)$ Skyrme scalar, which is contracted to an effective $O(3)$ Skyrme scalar. Technically, this study maps the methods to be applied in higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate physical time with the topology of magnetic field vortices. We base ourselves on a formulation of unimodular gravity where the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ appears as the canonical dual to a variable which on-shell becomes four-volume time. If the theory is restricted to a topological axionic form (viz. a parity-odd product of an electric and a magnetic field), such a time variable becomes the spatial integral of the Chern-Simons density. The latter equates to helicity, so that unimodular time is transmuted into the linking number of the vortices of the topological magnetic field, times their flux. With the added {\it postulate} that this flux is a universal constant, the flow of time can thus be interpreted as the progressive weaving of further links between magnetic field vortices, each link providing a quantum of time with value related to the fixed flux. Non-abelian extensions, and targetting parameters other than $\Lambda$ are briefly examined, exposing different types of vortices and a possible role for inter-linking leading to new phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the speed of propagation of physical excitations is encoded in the coefficients of five-point interactions. This leads to a superluminality bound on scalar five-point interactions, which we present here for the first time. To substantiate our result, we also consider the case of four-point interactions for which bounds from S-matrix sum rules exist and show that these are parametrically equivalent to the bounds obtained within our analysis. Finally, we extend the discussion to a class of higher-point interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the method of smoothed asymptotics developed by Terence Tao, we introduce a new ultra-violet regularisation scheme for loop integrals in quantum field theory which we call $\eta$ regularisation. This allows us to reveal a surprising connection between the elimination of divergences in divergent series of powers and the preservation of gauge invariance in the regularisation of loop integrals in quantum field theory. In particular, we note that a method for regularising the series of natural numbers so that it converges to minus one twelfth inspires a regularisation scheme for non-abelian gauge theories coupled to Dirac fermions that preserves the Ward identity for the vacuum polarisation tensor. We also comment on a possible connection to Schwinger proper time integrals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waveform: A Tale of Two Formalisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum-amplitude-based derivation of the gravitational waveform emitted by the scattering of two spinless massive bodies at the third order in Newton's constant, $h \sim G+G^2+G^3$ (one-loop level), and correspondingly update its comparison with its classically-derived multipolar-post-Minkowskian counterpart. A spurious-pole-free reorganization of the one-loop five-point amplitude substantially simplifies the post-Newtonian expansion. We find complete agreement between the two results up to the fifth order in the small velocity expansion after taking into account three subtle aspects of the amplitude derivation: (1) in agreement with [arXiv:2312.07452 [hep-th]], the term quadratic in the amplitude in the observable-based formalism [JHEP 02, 137 (2019)] generates a frame rotation by half the classical scattering angle; (2) the dimensional regularization of the infrared divergences of the amplitude introduces an additional $(d-4)/(d-4)$ finite term; and (3) zero-frequency gravitons are found to contribute additional terms both at order $h \sim G^1$ and at order $h \sim G^3$ when including disconnected diagrams in the observable-based formalism.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the radial action of a spinning probe particle in Kerr spacetime from the worldline formalism in the first-order form, focusing on linear in spin effects. We then develop a novel covariant Dirac bracket formalism to compute the impulse and the spin kick directly from the radial action, generalizing some conjectural results in the literature and providing ready-to-use expressions for amplitude calculations with generic spin orientations. This allows, for the first time, to find new covariant expressions for scattering observables in the probe limit up to $\mathcal{O}(G^6 s_1 s_2^4)$. Finally, we use the action-angle representation to compute the fundamental frequencies for generic bound orbits, including the intrinsic spin precession, the periastron advance and the precession of the orbital plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the information paradox of rotating Kerr black holes by employing the recently proposed island rule. It is known that the scalar field theory near the Kerr black hole horizon can be reduced to the 2-dimensional effective theory. Working within the framework of the 2-dimensional effective theory and assuming the small angular momentum limit, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation from the non-extremal Kerr black hole follows the Page curve and saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at late times. In addition, we also discuss the effect of the black hole rotation on the Page time and scrambling time. For the extreme Kerr black hole, the entanglement entropy at late times also approximates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extreme Kerr black hole. These results imply that entanglement islands can provide a semi-classical resolution of the information paradox for rotating Kerr black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that Nash theory, a quadratic theory of Gravity, can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration without any exotic matter or cosmological constant. The observational viability of an exact cosmological solution of Nash theory is adjudged using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and JLA+OHD+BAO data sets. Departures from standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology are noted and analyzed. We prove that the Nash vacuum dynamics is equivalent to the dynamics of an Einstein vacuum plus a self-interacting Higgs scalar field, only if a mild evolution of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value is allowed. This leads to variations in the mass scales of fundamental particles and the fine structure constant. The variations are found to fit nicely with the analysis of molecular absorption spectra from a series of Quasars.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of High-Temperature Relaxation Dynamics in Random Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality is a crucial concept in modern physics, allowing us to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of parameters. In this work, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$. Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A&gt;0$, with frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size $N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of quantum many-body dynamics beyond low energy limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined the quantum properties of scalar-tensor gravity with a coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term in the low energy limit, exploring both linear and quadratic couplings. We calculated the leading-order corrections to the non-relativistic one-body gravitational potential and the metric by studying the gravitational field of a point-like scalar particle. We studied light-like scattering and compared it with the classical theory. We found that the non-minimal coupling does not contribute to the small-angle scattering for the quadratic coupling but does in the case of linear coupling. The results provide an opportunity to constrain the linear non-minimal coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term with forthcoming observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulations of colliding superconducting strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collisions of elastic superconducting strings, also referred to as current-carrying strings, formed in a $U_{\rm local}(1) \times U_{\rm global}(1)$ field-theory model, using three-dimensional numerical field-theoretic simulations. The breaking of $U_{\rm local}(1)$ leads to string formation via the Higgs mechanism, while the scalar field of the second $U_{\rm global}(1)$ carries the current, which condenses onto the string. We construct straight and static superconducting string solutions numerically and identify the regions in which they exist in the model parameter space. We then perform dynamical simulations for colliding superconducting strings with various collision angles and collision velocities. We explore the kinematic parameter space for six sets of model parameters characterising the coupling between the two scalar fields and the current on the string. The final states of the strings (after the collision) are reported diagrammatically. We classify them into four categories: (i) regular intercommutation, (ii) double intercommutation, (iii) bound state, and (iv) expanding string solution. We find that the outcome of the collision process is the regular intercommutation of the colliding strings in most of the kinematic parameter space while they form bound states for small velocities and small angles. We also find that the strings undergo two successive intercommutations and, therefore, pass through one other in a small region corresponding to relatively small angles and velocities of order c/2. The string structure breaks down when there is a relatively large coupling between the two scalar fields, even if each string is stable before the occurrence of the collision.</description>

      <title>Swamplandish Unification of the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a short overview of recent progress made in our understanding of the dark sector based on the Swampland program which in turn is rooted in lessons from string theory. We explain how the existence of one extra mesoscopic dimension (the ``dark dimension") in the micron range emerges and how this can lead to a unification of the dark energy and dark matter. In particular the smallness of the dark energy leads to the prediction of the existence of a tower of weakly interacting light particles which can naturally play the role of dark matter. Moreover this unifies dark matter with gravity as dark matter ends up being excitations of graviton in the dark dimension. We also explain how in combination with other Swampland principles one finds an explanation of the ``why now" and the ``cosmological coincidence" problems. This model is consistent with the cosmological bounds as well as the Newton's inverse square law, but makes predictions which differ from $\Lambda$CDM. It also gives rise to an appealing picture of hierarchy of scales in particle physics pegged to the dark energy, including a possible origin of the electroweak hierarchy and the prediction of masses of QCD axion and sterile neutrinos both in the 1-10 meV range. This review is intended for a broad audience of high energy theorists and cosmologists without prior knowledge of string theory and it explains the motivations and predictions of this program in a non-technical form.</description>

      <title>Probing the signature of axions through the quasinormal modes of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion-photon coupling allows the existence of a magnetically and electrically charged black hole (BH) solution endowed with a pseudo-scalar hair. For the Reissner-Nordstrom BH with a given total charge and mass, it is known that the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are independent of the mixture between the magnetic and electric charges due to the presence of electric-magnetic duality. We show that the BH with an axion hair breaks this degeneracy by realizing nontrivial QNMs that depend on the ratio between the magnetic and total charges. Thus, the upcoming observations of BH QNMs through gravitational waves offer an exciting possibility for probing the existence of both magnetic monopoles and the axion coupled to photons.</description>

Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>

Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Supertranslation ambiguity in post-Minkowskian expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity. In the context of post-Minkowskian expansion, the supertranslation ambiguity arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss to start at ${\cal O}(G^2)$ or at ${\cal O}(G^3)$ in gravitational scattering. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity at the linear order in post-Minkowskian expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss. The proposal is self-contained in the post-Minkowskian expansion and involves only null infinity data.</description>

      <title>Quadratic perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole: The algebraically special sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>
