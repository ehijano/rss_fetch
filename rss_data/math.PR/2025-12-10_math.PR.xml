      <title>Conditions for Equivalence of Random Interlacements and Random Walk Reflected off of Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a transient weighted graph, there are two models of random walk which continue after reaching infinity: random interlacements, and random walk reflected off of infinity, recently introduced in arXiv:2506.18827 [math.PR]. We prove these two models are equivalent if and only if all harmonic functions of the underlying graph with finite Dirichlet energy are constant functions, or equivalently, the free and wired spanning forests coincide. In particular, examples where the models are equivalent include $\mathbb{Z}^d$, cartesian products, and many Cayley graphs, while examples that fail the condition include all transient trees.</description>

      <title>Large Excursions of Reflected L\'evy Processes: Asymptotic Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the geometric properties of excursions of L\'evy processes reflected at the past infimum with long lifetime or large height. For an oscillating process in the domain of attraction of a stable law, our results state that excursions with a long lifetime need not have a large height. After a suitable scaling, they behave like stable excursions with lifetime or height greater than one. These extend the related results in Doney and Rivero [Prob. Theory Relat. Fields, 157(1) (2013) 1-45]. In contrast, for the negative-drift case we prove that under a heavy-tailed condition, long lifetime and large height are asymptotically equivalent. Conditioned on either event, excursions converge under spatial scaling to a single-jump process with Pareto-distributed jump size and size-biased jump time. Moreover, after a suitable time rescaling, the effect of the negative drift becomes apparent.</description>

      <title>Fractional Homogenization of Parabolic Equations with Long-Range Random Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a complete homogenization theory for the one-dimensional parabolic equation with long-range correlated random potential: \[ \partial_t u_\varepsilon(t,x) = \frac{1}{2} \partial_{xx} u_\varepsilon(t,x) + \varepsilon^{-\alpha/2} a\left(\frac{x}{\varepsilon}\right) u_\varepsilon(t,x), \] where the random field $a$ has covariance decaying as $|x|^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Contrary to classical homogenization where rapid decorrelation leads to deterministic limits, the non-integrable covariance preserves macroscopic randomness.
  We prove that under the critical scaling $\varepsilon^{-\alpha/2}$, the solution converges in distribution to a stochastic limit described by a fractional Gaussian field with Hurst index $H = 1-\alpha/2 &gt; 1/2$: \[ u(t,x) = \mathbb{E}^B\left[\varphi(x+B_t) \exp\left(\beta\int_{\mathbb{R}} L_t^x(y) dW^H(y)\right)\right], \] where $W^H$ is fractional Brownian motion and the integral is a Young integral. Our contributions include: (i) functional convergence of the integrated potential to fBm, (ii) quantitative convergence rates in Wasserstein distance $W_2(u_\varepsilon, u) \leq C\varepsilon^{\min(\alpha,1-\alpha)/4}$, (iii) a central limit theorem for rescaled fluctuations with scaling $\varepsilon^{-\alpha/4}$, and (iv) superdiffusive transport $\mathbb{E}[X_t^2] \sim t^{2H}$.
  The results reveal a new homogenization mechanism driven by long-range dependence, connecting stochastic homogenization, fractional calculus, and anomalous diffusion theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general approach for proving small time asymptotic of spectral heat content for any translation invariant isotropic process satisfying negligible tail probability condition. As a consequence, we recover several existing results in the context of L\'evy processes and Gaussian processes, and provide spectral heat content asymptotic for a class of time-changed Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations from a random fractional averaging limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of multiscale stochastic differential equations whose slow component is drivenby a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H greater than 1/2. Under ergodic assumptions ensuring the applicability of the fractional averaging and fractional homogenization theorems of Hairer and Li (arXiv:1902.11251, arXiv:2109.06948), we establish a fluctuation result. The deviation of the slow motion, scaled by epsilon^{1/2-H}, from its effective, time-dependent random limit converges, as the time-separation scale epsilon tends to zero, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and influenced by an additional space--time Gaussian field. Since the averaging principle and the fractional homogenization hold in different modes of convergence, obtaining the required joint convergence is a delicate matter. Moreover, neither the continuity of the Ito--Lyons solution map nor the martingale method is directly applicable for our purposes, so the proof requires several innovations. To establish the fluctuation theorem, we combine cumulant methods with a residue lemma and formulate the enlarged system as a rough differential equation in a suitable space.</description>

      <title>Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player game in continuous time, where each player's objective functional depends non-linearly on the expected value of the state process. As a result, the classical Bellman optimality principle no longer applies. To address this, we adopt a two-layer game-theoretic framework and seek sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria both at the intra-personal level, which accounts for time inconsistency, and at the inter-personal level, which captures strategic interactions among players. We first characterise sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and the corresponding value processes of all players through a system of coupled backward stochastic differential equations. We then analyse the mean-field counterpart and its sub-game--perfect mean-field equilibria, described by a system of McKean-Vlasov backward stochastic differential equations. Building on this representation, we finally prove the convergence of sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and their corresponding value processes in the $N$-player game to their mean-field counterparts.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits of a Weakly Perturbed Random Interface Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random interface model on the discrete torus with $2n$ sites, obtained from the classical corner flip dynamics but with a weak global perturbation, namely an asymmetry of order $n^{-\gamma}$ of the direction of growth that switches direction based on the sign of the total area under the interface. The slopes of this model can be viewed as a non-simple exclusion process at half filling with globally dependent rates. We show that, for $\gamma=1$, the hydrodynamic equation of the empirical density is given by a time concatenation of the viscous Burgers equation and the heat equation. Moreover, for $n$ prime and $\gamma&gt;\frac{6}{7}$, we establish convergence in law of the equilibrium fluctuations to an infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Three views on the thinned Bernoulli field on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thinned Bernoulli field (TBF) on the one-dimensional integer lattice, where isolated occupied sites are removed from a standard Bernoulli configuration with density $p$. Our present work complements previous findings in higher dimensions and on trees by focusing on the detailed behavior on the line, particularly as $p$ approaches $1.$ First we show that while the TBF on the line is always quasilocally Gibbs, it displays a growing sensitivity to boundary conditions as $p$ increases, indicating an incipient loss of quasilocality. We provide precise asymptotics for this phenomenon, which is an echo of non-quasilocality happening in higher dimensions. Second, we turn to the one-sided point of view and prove that the TBF is a g-measure in the sense of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The corresponding g-function is quasilocal but becomes long-range again for large $p$. From that we finally develop our third view, in which we provide a transparent construction of the process in terms of a driving Markov chain on the integers of generalized house of cards type, offering a novel perspective on the TBF.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation on the Skorokhod space via Malliavin calculus and regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a carr\'e du champ operator for Banach-valued random elements, taking values in the projective tensor product, and use it to control the bounded Lipschitz distance between a Malliavin-smooth random element satisfying mild regularity assumptions and a Radon Gaussian taking values in the Skorokhod space equipped with the uniform topology. In the case where the random element is a Banach-valued multiple integral, the carr\'e du champ expression is further bounded by norms of the contracted integral kernel. The main technical tool is an integration by parts formula, which might be of independent interest.
  As a by-product, we recover a bound obtained recently by D\"uker and Zoubouloglou in the Hilbert space setting and complement it by providing contraction bounds.</description>

      <title>Failure of the Markov property for stochastic Volterra equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-driven stochastic dynamics arise naturally in many applications, and stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) offer a flexible framework for modeling such systems. Their convolution structure with Volterra kernels endows the dynamics with a formal path-dependency, which suggests the failure of the Markov property. While this has previously been rigorously established only for Gaussian Volterra processes, by constructing nondegenerate admissible perturbations through Markovian lifts, we prove that also general SVEs with H\"older-continuous coefficients do not possess the Markov property for a broad class of Volterra kernels. Moreover, we show that the associated Markovian lift is, in general, necessarily infinite-dimensional. These observations reflect the intrinsic infinite-dimensionality of memory effects in SVEs and underscore the need for analytical and probabilistic tools beyond the classical Markovian framework.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Diffusion Posterior Sampling for MR Image Reconstruction Using the Preconditioned Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) in combination with diffusion models can generate high quality MRI reconstructions with uncertainty estimation from highly undersampled k-space data. However, sampling methods such as diffusion posterior sampling or likelihood annealing suffer from long reconstruction times and the need for parameter tuning. The purpose of this work is to develop a robust sampling algorithm with fast convergence.
  Theory and Methods: In the reverse diffusion process used for sampling the posterior, the exact likelihood is multiplied with the diffused prior at all noise scales. To overcome the issue of slow convergence, preconditioning is used. The method is trained on fastMRI data and tested on retrospectively undersampled brain data of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: For posterior sampling in Cartesian and non-Cartesian accelerated MRI the new approach outperforms annealed sampling in terms of reconstruction speed and sample quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed exact likelihood with preconditioning enables rapid and reliable posterior sampling across various MRI reconstruction tasks without the need for parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>State and Parameter Estimation for a Neural Model of Local Field Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of cortical dynamics during different states such as decision making, sleep and movement, is an important topic in Neuroscience. Modelling efforts aim to relate the neural rhythms present in cortical recordings to the underlying dynamics responsible for their emergence. We present an effort to characterize the neural activity from the cortex of a mouse during natural sleep, captured through local field potential measurements. Our approach relies on using a discretized Wilson--Cowan Amari neural field model for neural activity, along with a data assimilation method that allows the Bayesian joint estimation of the state and parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic measurements before applying it to a dataset available in literature. Our findings suggest the potential of our approach to characterize the stimulus received by the cortex from other brain regions, while simultaneously inferring a state that aligns with the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Provable Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Bayesian Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based posterior sampling method within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework. Our approach constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior, using a warm-start strategy to initialize the particles. To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure. Our analysis further clarifies how the prior score-matching error and the condition number of the Bayesian inverse problem influence overall performance. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>The Instability of Painlev\'e Equations in Recovering Largest Eigenvalue Distributions of GUE, LUE, JUE and an Attempt of Solution to It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the largest eigenvalue for the three classical unitary ensembles -- GUE, LUE, and JUE -- admits two complementary exact descriptions: (i) as Fredholm determinants of their orthogonal polynomial correlation kernels and (ii) as isomonodromic $\tau$--functions governed by Painlev\'e equations. For finite $n$, the associated Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\sigma$-forms are $\PIV$ (GUE), $\mathrm{PV}$ (LUE), and $\PVI$ (JUE); under soft- or hard-edge scalings these degenerate to $\PII$ or $\PIIIp$ descriptions of the Tracy-Widom and hard-edge laws \cite{tracy1994level,forrester2003painleve,deift1999orthogonal}.
  It is well known among random matrix theorists (for example Folkmar Bornemann) that the Fredholm determinant is a more numerically stable and accurate way to compute the CDF of the largest eigenvalue for GUE, LUE, JUE than direct Painlev\'e integration. The aim of this paper is not to improve on Fredholm methods, but to see to what extent one can numerically recover the \emph{correct} Painlev\'e solution from finite-$n$ data and how unstable this reconstruction is. Numerically, we verify the equality between the Fredholm- and Painlev\'e-based CDFs by combining (a) high-accuracy Nystr\"om discretizations of the finite-$n$ Fredholm determinants \cite{bornemann2010numerical} with (b) an anchored, branch-locked integration of the $\sigma$-form ODEs, where anchors are extracted from local least-squares fits to $\log\det(I-\mathsf K)$. Our results confirm agreement across GUE/LUE/JUE with precision of $O(10^{-3})$ to $O(10^{-5})$ (occasionally $O(10^{-2})$) and illustrate the finite-$n$ to scaling-limit transition. The theoretical connections to $\tau$-functions and Virasoro constraints follow the framework of \cite{adler2000random,forrester2003painleve}</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wishart kernel density estimator (KDE) is introduced for density estimation in the cone of positive definite matrices. The estimator is boundary-aware and mitigates the boundary bias suffered by conventional KDEs, while remaining simple to implement. Its mean squared error, uniform strong consistency on expanding compact sets, and asymptotic normality are established under the Lebesgue measure and suitable mixing conditions. This work represents the first study of density estimation on this space under any metric. For independent observations, an asymptotic upper bound on the mean absolute error is also derived. A simulation study compares the performance of the Wishart KDE to another boundary-aware KDE that relies on the matrix-variate lognormal distribution proposed by Schwartzman [Int. Stat. Rev., 2016, 84(3), 456-486]. Results suggest that the Wishart KDE is superior for a selection of autoregressive coefficient matrices and innovation covariance matrices when estimating the stationary marginal density of a Wishart autoregressive process. To illustrate the practical utility of the Wishart KDE, an application to finance is made by estimating the marginal density function of a time series of realized covariance matrices, calculated from 5-minute intra-day returns, between the share prices of Amazon Corp. and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 exchange-traded fund over a one-year period. All code is publicly available via the R package ksm to facilitate implementation of the method and reproducibility of the findings.</description>

      <title>Causal inference under interference: computational barriers and algorithmic solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study causal effect estimation under interference from network data. We work under the chain-graph formulation pioneered in Tchetgen Tchetgen et. al (2021). Our first result shows that polynomial time evaluation of treatment effects is computationally hard in this framework without additional assumptions on the underlying chain graph. Subsequently, we assume that the interactions among the study units are governed either by (i) a dense graph or (ii) an i.i.d. Gaussian matrix. In each case, we show that the treatment effects have well-defined limits as the population size diverges to infinity. Additionally, we develop polynomial time algorithms to consistently evaluate the treatment effects in each case. Finally, we estimate the unknown parameters from the observed data using maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates, and establish the stability of our causal effect estimators under this perturbation. Our algorithms provably approximate the causal effects in polynomial time even in low-temperature regimes where the canonical MCMC samplers are slow mixing. For dense graphs, our results use the notion of regularity partitions; for Gaussian interactions, our approach uses ideas from spin glass theory and Approximate Message Passing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Discrepancy of Random Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights.
  Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$.
  Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</description>

      <title>The 1/4-phenomenon of placement probabilities of tilings in the Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. Using the Domino Shuffling algorithm introduced by Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp in arXiv:math/9201305, we are able to generate domino tilings uniformly at random. In this paper, we investigate the probability of finding a domino at a specific position in such a random tiling. We prove that this placement probability is always equal to $1/4$ plus a rational function, whose shape depends on the location of the domino, multiplied by a position-independent factor that involves only the size of the diamond. This result leads to significantly more compact explicit counting formulas compared to previous findings. As a direct application, we derive explicit counting formulas for the domino tilings of Aztec diamonds with $2\times 2$-square holes at arbitrary positions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2024, Courtade, Fathi and Mikulincer gave a proof of the symmetrized Talagrand inequality based on stochastic calculus, in the spirit of Borell's proof of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. The symmetrized Talagrand inequality can be seen as a dual form of the functional Santal\'o inequality. The modest purpose of this note is to give a simplified version of the Courtade, Fathi and Mikulincer argument. Namely we first recall briefly Borell's original argument, and we then explain a simple twist in his proof that allows to recover the functional Santal\'o inequality directly, rather than in its dual form.</description>

      <title>A New Application of Hoeffding's Inequality Can Give Traders Early Warning of Financial Regime Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hoeffding's Inequality provides the maximum probability that a series of n draws from a bounded random variable differ from the variable's true expectation u by more than given tolerance t. The random variable is typically the error rate of a classifier in machine learning applications. Here, a trading strategy is premised on the assumption of an underlying distribution of causal factors, in other words, a market regime, and the random variable is the performance of that trading strategy. A larger deviation of observed performance from the trader's expectation u can be characterized as a lower probability that the financial regime supporting that strategy remains in force, and a higher probability of financial regime change. The changing Hoeffding probabilities can be used as an early warning indicator of this change.</description>

      <title>Boundary trace theorems for symmetric reflected diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with a transient irreducible diffusion process $X^0$ on a locally compact separable metric space $(D, d)$, one can construct a canonical symmetric reflected diffusion process $\bar X$ on a completion $D^*$ of $(D, d)$ through the theory of reflected Dirichlet spaces. The boundary trace process $\check X$ of $X$ on the boundary $\partial D:=D^*\setminus D$ is the reflected diffusion process $\bar X$ time-changed by a smooth measure $\nu$ having full quasi-support on $\partial D$. The Dirichlet form of the trace process $\check X$ is called the trace Dirichlet form. In the first part of the paper, we give a Besov space type characterization of the domain of the trace Dirichlet form for any good smooth measure $\nu$ on the boundary $\partial D$. In the second part of this paper, we study properties of the harmonic measure of $\bar X$ on the boundary $\partial D$. In particular, we provide a condition equivalent to the doubling property of the harmonic measure. Finally, we characterize and provide estimates of the jump kernel of the trace Dirichlet form under the doubling condition of the harmonic measure on $\partial D$.</description>

      <title>Recovering Parameters from Edge Fluctuations: Beta-Ensembles and Critically-Spiked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda=\{\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2,\ldots\}$ be the point process that describes the edge scaling limit of either (i) "regular" beta-ensembles with inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$, or (ii) the top eigenvalues of Wishart or Gaussian invariant random matrices perturbed by $r_0\geq1$ critical spikes. In other words, $\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue point process of one of the scalar or multivariate stochastic Airy operators. We prove that a single observation of $\Lambda$ suffices to recover (almost surely) either (i) $\beta$ in the case of beta-ensembles, or (ii) $r_0$ in the case of critically-spiked models. Our proof relies on the recently-developed semigroup theory for the multivariate stochastic Airy operators.
  Going beyond these parameter-recovery applications, our results also (iii) refine our understanding of the rigidity properties of $\Lambda$, and (iv) shed new light on the equality (in distribution) of stochastic Airy spectra with different dimensions and the same Robin boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions with (possibly) superlinear gradient growth under kinetic (underdamped) Langevin algorithms. Using a carefully tailored taming scheme, we propose two novel discretizations of the kinetic Langevin SDE, and we show that they are both contractive and satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Building on this, we establish a series of non-asymptotic bounds in $2$-Wasserstein distance between the law reached by each algorithm and the underlying target measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>

      <title>Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.11682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require adaptive step sizes to have a "no skip" property and to take values at only dyadic times. Secondly, in contrast to the Euler-Maruyama method, we require the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and analyze numerical methods for underdamped (kinetic) Langevin dynamics in a domain with elastic reflection at the boundary. First-order approximations are based on an Euler-type scheme incorporating collision-handling at the boundary. To achieve second order, composition schemes are derived based on decomposition of the generator into collisional drift, impulse, and stochastic momentum evolution. In a deterministic setting, this approach would typically lead to first-order approximation, even in symmetric compositions, but we find that the stochastic method can provide second-order weak approximation with a single gradient evaluation, both at finite times and in the ergodic limit. We provide analysis of this observation, as well as numerical demonstration, and we compare and contrast the performance of different variants of the integration method using model problems.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

      <title>Sufficient digits and density estimation: A Bayesian nonparametric approach using generalized finite P\'olya trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for statistical modelling of a continuous random variable $X$ on $[0, 1)$, based on its digit representation $X=.X_1X_2\ldots$. In general, $X$ can be coupled with a latent random variable $N$ so that $(X_1,\ldots,X_N)$ becomes a sufficient statistics and $.X_{N+1}X_{N+2}\ldots$ is uniformly distributed. In line with this fact, and focusing on binary digits for simplicity, we propose a family of generalized finite P{\'o}lya trees that induces a random density for a sample, which becomes a flexible tool for density estimation. Here, the digit system may be random and learned from the data. We provide a detailed Bayesian analysis, including closed form expression for the posterior distribution. We analyse the frequentist properties as the sample size increases, and provide sufficient conditions for consistency of the posterior distributions of the random density and $N$. We consider an extension to data spanning multiple orders of magnitude, and propose a prior distribution that encodes the so-called extended Newcomb-Benford law. Such a model shows promising results for density estimation of human-activity data. Our methodology is illustrated on several synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation for Two-Timescale Linear Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Global Optimization: From Theory to Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an abstract measure___theoretic framework that serves as a tool to rigorously study stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms as a unified class. The framework is formulated in terms of probability kernels, which, via the Ionescu--Tulcea theorem, induce probability measures on the space of sequences of algorithm iterations, endowed with two intuitive properties. This framework answers the need for a general, implementation___independent formalism in the analysis of such algorithms, providing a starting point for formalizing general results in proof-assistants. To illustrate the relevance of our tool, we show that common algorithms fit naturally in the framework, and we also use it to give a rigorous proof of a general consistency theorem for stochastic iterative global optimization algorithms (Proposition 3 of (Malherbe, et al., 2017). This proof and the entire framework are formalized in the Lean proof assistant. This formalization both ensures the correctness of the definitions and proofs, and provides a basis for future machine-assisted formalizations in the field.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations to invariant measures of hybrid stochastic differential equations with superlinear coefficients via the backward Euler-Maruyama method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Markovian switching, whose drift and diffusion coefficients are allowed to contain superlinear terms, the backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method is proposed to approximate the invariant measure. The existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure of the numerical solution generated by the BEM method is proved. Then the convergence of the numerical invariant measure to its underlying counterpart is shown. Those results obtained in this work release the requirement of the global Lipschitz condition on the diffusion coefficient in [X. Li et al. SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 56(3)(2018), pp. 1435-1455] and can also be regarded as a non-trivial extension of [W. Liu et al. Appl. Numer. Math. 184(2023), pp. 137-150] to the case of hybrid SDEs.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds, hitting times and the power of choice for random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random geometric graph process where random points $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$ are embedded consecutively in the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, and every two points at distance at most $r$ form an edge. As $r\to 0$, we confirm that well-known hitting time results for $k$-connectivity (with $k\ge 1$ fixed) and Hamiltonicity in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process also hold for the considered geometric analogue. Moreover, we exhibit a sort of probabilistic monotonicity for each of these properties.
  We also study a geometric analogue of the power of choice where, at each step, an agent is given two random points sampled independently and uniformly from $\mathbb{T}^d$ and must add exactly one of them to the already constructed point set. When the agent is allowed to make their choice with the knowledge of the entire sequence of random points (offline 2-choice), we show that they can construct a connected graph at the first time $t$ when none of the first $t$ pairs of proposed points contains two isolated vertices in the graph induced by $(X_i)_{i=1}^{2t}$, and maintain connectivity thereafter by following a simple algorithm. We also derive analogous results for $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity. This shows that each of the said properties can be attained two times faster (time-wise) and with four times fewer points in the offline 2-choice process compared to the 1-choice process.
  In the online version where the agent only knows the process until the current time step, we show that $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity cannot be significantly accelerated (time-wise) but may be realised on two times fewer points compared to the 1-choice analogue.</description>
