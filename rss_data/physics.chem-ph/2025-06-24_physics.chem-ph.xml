      <title>Revisiting Sampling Strategies for Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling strategies in diffusion models are critical to molecular generation yet remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we investigate a broad spectrum of sampling methods beyond conventional defaults and reveal that sampling choice substantially affects molecular generation performance. In particular, we identify a maximally stochastic sampling (StoMax), a simple yet underexplored strategy, as consistently outperforming default sampling methods for generative models DDPM and BFN. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of sampling design and suggest promising directions for advancing molecular generation through principled and more expressive sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Single-Crystal NMR for 17O in Alanine Enantiomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, which enables detailed analysis of the electronic structures of crystalline molecules, offers a unique opportunity to investigate molecular chirality -- an essential feature with broad implications for understanding the origin and function of life. In this study, we employ single-crystal ssNMR spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to examine the electronic structure of 17O nuclei in crystalline forms of alanine enantiomers. Eight magnetically nonequivalent 17O resonances within the unit cell were observed and successfully assigned, and their corresponding NMR tensor parameters were determined. The experimental findings were compared with previous NMR studies as well as with DFT calculations performed in this work. The DFT results not only supported the assignment of crystallographically distinct 17O sites but also revealed previously unobserved antisymmetric components of the chemical shift tensors. This study presents the first comprehensive characterization of 17O NMR tensors in alanine enantiomers and underscores the power of integrating single-crystal ssNMR with X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations to advance our understanding of molecular chirality in amino acids.</description>

      <title>Master equation study of three-body recombination of nitrogen and oxygen in non-equilibrium hypersonic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to study the energy transfer and recombination processes in N$_{2}$$\left(^{1}\sum^{+}_{g}\right)$+N$\left(^{4}S_{u}\right)$ and O$_{2}$$\left(^{3}\sum^{+}_{g}\right)$+O$\left(^{3}P_{2}\right)$ chemical systems when the system is suddenly cooled in a 0-D isothermal reactor thereby inducing strong non-equilibrium. A state-to-state (StS) study of the non-equilibrium phenomenon is crucial for developing accurate and efficient reduced-order models that can accurately capture the thermophysics involved. The gas mixture, consisting primarily of atoms at a high initial temperature of 10,000 K, is suddenly plunged into a low-temperature heat bath to simulate non-equilibrium recombination conditions. The population distribution of microscopic energy levels for each system is determined by solving a system of master equations. The conventional assumption of faster equilibration of rotational mode as compared to the vibrational mode holds for $ N_2 +N$, while it is not a very strong assumption for $ O_2 +O$ as the two relaxation time scales are comparable. Effective recombination rate constants for the quasi-steady state (QSS) period are calculated using the population distribution obtained by solving the master equations. It was also observed that the relaxation time constants for heating and cooling are different, with the time constant being lower for the cooling case due to anharmonicity effects in expanding flows. An attempt has also been made to use the insights from the StS analysis to determine an accurate binning strategy for the recombination processes involved in the two chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed Planewave and Localized Orbital Basis for Sparse-Stochastic Hybrid TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mixed basis-set approach to obtain optical absorption spectra within a generalized Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory framework. All occupied valence molecular orbitals (MOs) are expanded in a plane-wave (PW) basis, while unoccupied MOs are derived primarily from localized atomic basis functions. The method accelerates spectral convergence when compared to fully PW-based simulations, with a $2-3$ fold reduction in the number of unoccupied MOs entering the Casida equation. The mixed-basis is placed on a common real-space grid, enabling our previously developed deterministic/sparse-stochastic evaluation of the exact exchange operator (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00987). This chemically intuitive and computationally efficient approach is validated across various molecular systems, including $\pi$-conjugated polymethine dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and a chlorophyll monomer.</description>

      <title>Controlling Effective Hamiltonians: Broadband Pulsed Dynamic Nuclear Polarization by Constrained Random Walk and Non-linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constrained random walk (cRW) and figure of merit (FOM) based non-linear optimization procedures for systematic design and fundamental understanding of magnetic resonance experiments dressing bilinear and linear effective Hamiltonians to provide broadband polarization transfer. cRW can be used directly for fast random experiment design, or in combination with non-linear optimization or optimal control, leveraging the optimization of a FOM function for efficient control of linear and bilinear terms derived by exact effective Hamiltonian theory (EEHT). The efficacy of the combined cRW and FOM-based optimization approach is demonstrated by the design of broadband dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) pulse sequences for static solids with an electron spin excitation bandwidth reaching 100 MHz.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Oxygen Adsorption using TPD Spectroscopy for Accurate DFT Prediction of ORR on Anatase Titanium Dioxide (101)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the wide use of first-principles calculations to elucidate catalytic reaction mechanisms, the reliability of the theory remains unknown for reactions that initiate with O$_2$ adsorption, as few papers in the literature have systematically verified the accuracy of the calculations. Here, we have overcome this issue by comparing calculated O$_2$ adsorption energy ($E_{\text{ads}}$) to simulated $E_{\text{ads}}$ distribution from experimental temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum. The distribution obtained based on equilibrium thermodynamic arguments is in good agreement with the calculated $E_{\text{ads}}$ from modelling O$_2$ adsorption on anatase-TiO$_2$(101) using the generalized gradient approximation and van der Waals density functionals (vdW-DFs) with Hubbard correction, which is particularly the case when vdW-DF3-opt2 is used. On this basis, we concluded that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) initiates from a physisorbed O$_2$ thermodynamically as stable as that in the gas phase. In contrast, the calculated $E_{\text{ads}}$ for Pt(111) exhibit a significant overestimation of the O$_2$ adsorption due to excessive vdW correction. Therefore, a systematic investigation based on TPD spectroscopy can be used to diagnose the reliability of theoretical predictions of ORR and is expected to lead to improvements in exchange-correlation functionals for catalysts.</description>

      <title>Resist the surface field: the H-bond network decides if water aligns at metal electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At an electrode, water molecules align to the surface field upon voltage application. This initiates important electrochemical reactions, e.g., hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Recently developed non-linear optical techniques challenge the traditional picture by quantifying a lack of water alignment at metal electrodes. We here provide theoretical and experimental evidences for the existence of a driving force that opposes water alignment to the surface field. Such driving force originates from the ordering templated by the metal surface on the physisorbed water layer, and scales with surface hydrophilicity. We hence propose a physical model for water alignment at electrodes based on a balance of H-bond network and surface field driving forces, which reconciles the traditional picture with the new experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the electronic wave function using deep variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel wave function partitioning method that integrates deep-learning variational Monte Carlo with ans\"atze based on generalized product functions. This approach effectively separates electronic wave functions (WFs) into multiple partial WFs representing, for example, the core and valence domains or different electronic shells. Although our ans\"atze do not explicitly include correlations between individual electron groups, we show that they accurately reproduce the underlying physics and chemical properties, such as dissociation curve, dipole moment, reaction energy, ionization energy, or atomic sizes. We identify the optimal number of core electrons and define physical core sizes for Li to Mg atoms. Our results demonstrate that core electrons can be effectively decoupled from valence electrons. We show that the core part of the WF remains nearly constant across different molecules and their geometries, enabling the transfer and reuse of the core part in WFs of more complex systems. This work provides a general framework for WF decomposition, offering potential advantages in computing and studying larger systems, and possibly paving the way for ab-initio development of effective core potentials. Though currently limited to small molecules due to scaling, we highlight several directions for extending our method it to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Double-hybrid density-functional theory with density-based basis-set correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory justifying the application of the density-based basis-set correction (DBBSC) method to double-hybrid approximations in order to accelerate their basis convergence. We show that, for the oneparameter double hybrids based on the adiabatic connection, the exact dependence of the basis-set correction functional on the coupling-constant parameter $\lambda$ involves a uniform coordinate scaling by a factor 1/$\lambda$ of the density and of the basis functions. Neglecting this uniform coordinate scaling corresponds essentially to the recent work of Mester and K{\'a}llay [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 16, 2136 (2025)] on the application of the DBBSC method to double-hybrid approximations. Test calculations on molecular atomization energies and reaction barrier heights confirm that the DBBSC method efficiently accelerates the basis convergence of double-hybrid approximations, and also show that neglecting the uniform coordinate scaling is a reasonable approximation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Vibronic Strong Coupling and Cavity-Modified Hydrogen Tunneling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons have gained significant attention for the tantalizing possibility of modifying chemical properties and dynamics by coupling molecules to resonant cavity modes to create hybrid light-matter quantum states. Herein, we implement the semiclassical nuclear-electronic orbital time-dependent configuration interaction (NEO-TDCI) approach, which treats electrons and specified nuclei on the same quantum mechanical level, while treating the cavity mode classically. This ab initio dynamics approach can describe both the electronic strong coupling (ESC) and the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regimes at the same level of theory without invoking the Born-Oppenheimer separation between the quantum nuclei and the electrons. This approach is used to simulate resonant and off-resonant vibronic strong coupling, where the cavity mode couples to one or many vibronic transitions associated with joint electronic-nuclear excitations within a vibronic progression. In this case, the cavity mode couples to nuclear motions even for cavity frequencies typically associated with ESC. This approach is also used to illustrate that coupling a molecule to a cavity mode can alter hydrogen tunneling dynamics. The semiclassical NEO-TDCI approach provides the foundation for investigating how polaritons may be able to influence chemical reactions involving tunneling and nonadiabatic effects.</description>

      <title>Three-phase contact line dynamics on moving fibers measured by X-ray holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetting of solid surfaces by a liquid is important for many natural and industrial processes such as printing, painting and coating. However, a quantitative description of the dynamic receding and advancing contact angle is still debated, in particular for aqueous solutions. One reason for our lack of quantitative understanding is the limited spatial resolution of currently used optical methods. We therefore present a new approach to access the sub-microscopic region. We use X-ray phase contrast imaging to measure the dynamic receding contact angle on a moving glass fiber of 17 um diameter. The fiber was pulled out of a liquid bath which was filled with a mixture of glycerol and Milli-Q water. The dynamic receding contact angle decreased with increasing contact line velocity for all mixtures. In the holograms we achieved a resolution of 50 nm/pixel with a spatial error of 450 nm. This spatial error is due to an extended surface region of the fiber and the liquid surface in the holograms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of X-ray holography as a method to investigate dynamic contact angle phenomena and thereby opening pathways to higher spatial and temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Integrating Classical and Quantum Software for Enhanced Simulation of Realistic Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of quantum computing for large-scale, realistic chemical systems through the development of a new interface using a quantum circuit simulator and CP2K, a highly efficient first-principles calculation software. Quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers require Hamiltonians prepared on classical computers. Moreover, to compute forces beyond just single-point energy calculations, one- and two-electron integral derivatives and response equations are also to be computed on classical computers. Our developed interface allows for efficient evaluation of forces with the quantum-classical hybrid framework for large chemical systems. We performed geometry optimizations and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations on typical condensed-phase systems. These included liquid water, molecular adsorption on solid surfaces, and biological enzymes. In water benchmarks with periodic boundary conditions, we confirmed that the cost of preparing second-quantized Hamiltonians and evaluating forces scales almost linearly with the simulation box size. This research marks a step towards the practical application of quantum-classical hybrid calculations, expanding the scope of quantum computing to realistic and complex chemical phenomena.</description>

      <title>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</description>

      <title>Chunk Twice, Embed Once: A Systematic Study of Segmentation and Representation Trade-offs in Chemistry-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches, offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants -- substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide actionable guidelines for building effective and efficient chemistry-aware RAG systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked tetratomic molecules (FL tetramers) to deeper bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>The physics, travels, and tribulations of Ronald Wilfrid Gurney</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to calculate the electronic band structure of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se. Ab-initio, calculations are performed in the Atomistix Toolkit program within the Density Functional Theory and Local Spin Density Approximation on Tight Tiger basis. We have used Hubbard U potential $U_{Fe} = 2.42$eV for 3d states for Fe ions. Super-cells of 8 and 64 atoms were constructed. After the construction of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se ($x=$ 6.25%; 25%) super-cells, atom relaxation and optimization of the crystal structure were carried out. Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV. Antiferromagnetic phase considered more stable. Our calculations show that the band gap increases with the increases in Fe ion concentration.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning from Molecules to Processes: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Virtual failure assessment diagrams for hydrogen transmission pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities in piezoelectric polymers: Effect of oriented amorphous fraction in ferroelectric semicrystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics of polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic principle of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from the polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the piezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%, primarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and bond angles. Instead, &gt;85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is closely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially stretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this perspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship is revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed FE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the isotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a polarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct piezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect). Meanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to grow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the piezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF homopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that high-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to improve its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the electrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers such as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.</description>

      <title>A 3D model simulation of hydrogen chloride photochemistry on Mars: Comparison with satellite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HCl was detected in the Martian atmosphere by the NOMAD and ACS spectrometers aboard the ExoMars TGO. Photochemical models show that using gas-phase chemistry alone is insufficient to reproduce these data. Recent work has developed a heterogeneous chemical network within a 1D photochemistry model, guided by the seasonal variability in HCl. The aim of this work is to show that incorporating heterogeneous chlorine chemistry into a global 3D model of Martian photochemistry with conventional gas-phase chemistry can reproduce spatial and temporal changes in hydrogen chloride on Mars. We incorporated this heterogeneous chlorine scheme into the MPCM to model chlorine photochemistry during MYs 34 and 35. These two years provide contrasting dust scenarios, with MY 34 featuring a global dust storm. We also examined correlations in the model results between HCl and other key atmospheric quantities, as well as production and loss processes, to understand the impact of different factors driving changes in HCl. We find that this 3D model of Martian is consistent with the changes in HCl observed by ACS in MY 34 and MY 35, including detections and 70% of non-detections. For the remaining 30%, model HCl is higher than the ACS detection limit due to biases associated with water vapour, dust, or water ice content at these locations. As with previous 1D model calculations, we find that heterogeneous chemistry is required to describe the loss of HCl, resulting in a lifetime of a few sols that is consistent with the observed seasonal variation in HCl. As a result of this proposed chemistry, modelled HCl is correlated with water vapour, airborne dust, and temperature, and anticorrelated with water ice. Our work shows that this chemical scheme enables the reproduction of aphelion detections in MY 35.</description>

      <title>Chelation of the mercury ions by polyethyleneimine: Atomistic molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contamination of water by heavy metal ions represents a significant environmental concern. Among various remediation methods, chelation has proven to be an effective technique in water treatment processes. This study investigates the chelating properties of linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) and its complexation with divalent mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous solution. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the OPLS/AA force field to examine the microscopic structure of PEI-Hg2+ complexes. PEI chains of varying lengths were considered, and it was found that a single linear PEI molecule containing ten amino groups is capable of coordinating up to four Hg2+ ions. The stability of the resulting complexes was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05961v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset comprehensively covering all possible neutral closed-shell small organic and inorganic molecules with up to five heavy (\textit{p}-block) atoms: C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. All valid stoichiometries, Lewis-rule-consistent graphs, and stable conformers (identified via GFN2-xTB) were enumerated combinatorially, yielding 577k conformational isomers spanning 258k constitutional isomers and 5,599 unique stoichiometries. DFT ($\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) optimizations were performed for all, and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are provided for 10,793 lowest-energy conformers with up to 4 heavy atoms. VQM24 includes structures, vibrational modes, rotational constants, thermodynamic properties (Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, ZPVEs, entropies, heat capacities), and electronic properties such as atomization, electron interaction, exchange-correlation, dispersion energies, multipole moments (dipole to hexadecapole), alchemical potentials, Mulliken charges, and wavefunctions. Machine learning models of atomization energies on this dataset reveal significantly higher complexity than QM9, with none achieving chemical accuracy. VQM24 offers a rigorous, high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH2 molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. We remove redundancies in order to execute a redundancy-free calculation. In view of the currently available noisy quantum hardware, we carry out parameter optimization on a classical computer and measure the energy with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation with error mitigation and post-selection on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12243 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Role of Peierls Vibrations in Singlet Fission with the Adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singlet fission, a phenomenon in which a singlet exciton is converted to two triplet excitons, is sensitive to vibrations that perturb couplings between electronic states (i.e., Peierls vibrations). In singlet fission models larger than dimers, the inconvenient scaling of exact simulations has limited treatment of Peierls vibrations to approximate methods. In this letter, we generalize the formally exact, reduced-scaling adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS) method to account for both Holstein and Peierls vibrations and study singlet fission in N,N'-Bis(2-phenylethyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenedi-carboximide (EP-PDI). We find that Peierls vibrations accelerate singlet fission by generating correlated charge transfer-mediated pathways that support constructive interference. Finally, we extend this singlet fission model to a linear chain of EP-PDI to demonstrate that Peierls vibrations can accelerate singlet-mediated triplet transport on the 100-nm scale.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>
