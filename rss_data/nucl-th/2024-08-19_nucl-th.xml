      <title>Quadrupole-Octupole Residual Interaction in the Proxy-$SU(3)$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The octupole deformation of atomic nuclei is a relevant research area given its implications in the nuclear structure and fundamental physics, however, inclusion of octupole degrees of freedom in the nuclear interaction has been explored little in $SU(3)$ symmetry-based models. In this article we expand the octupole operator $\mathcal{O}^3_\mu$ in the $SU(3)$ second quantization formalism and use it to formulate an octupole-octupole residual interaction $\mathcal{O}^3\cdot \mathcal{O}^3$ which is incorporated in Elliott's model Hamiltonian. We compute the matrix elements of this extended Hamiltonian and use them to calculate energy levels and analyse the $B(E3; 3^-_1\rightarrow 0^+_1)$ transition strength of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the proxy-$SU(3)$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger study of baryon-charged QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimessenger studies of heavy-ion collisions, using hadrons and electromagnetic probes, can reveal the properties of the created QCD matter from different perspectives. This study calculates the thermal dilepton invariant mass spectra and thermal photon transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au collisions at low beam energies from the Beam Energy Scan program, using a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated by rapidity-dependent hadronic distributions. The effects of thermodynamic rapidity variation, baryon chemical potential, and fluid expansion on the spectra are explored. Methods for extracting temperature from photon and dilepton spectra are examined by comparison with the underlying hydrodynamic temperature. The possibility of combining photon and dilepton spectra to extract radial flow is also investigated. This study provides insights into measuring the thermodynamic properties of the created systems in heavy-ion collisions using multiple messengers through two fundamental interactions within the same framework.</description>

      <title>Extended formalism for the study of final-state interaction in $\gamma p\,\rightarrow\,K^{+}\pi\,\Sigma$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the formalism for the low-energy analysis of the $\gamma p\rightarrow K^{+}\pi\Sigma$ photoproduction reaction to include the strangeness $S=-1$ meson-baryon p-wave final-state interaction with total angular momentum $J=\frac{3}{2}\,$. As an application, and a check of our method, we evaluate contributions due to the exchange of the $\Sigma^{\ast}(1385)$ resonance as derived from a chiral Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Factorized QED Contribution to Lepton-Hadron DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) factorized QED contributions to the short-distance hard coefficients of inclusive lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in a joint QCD and QED factorization approach. We demonstrate how the joint factorization consistently factorize all perturbative collinear sensitivities of partonic scattering in both QCD and QED into corresponding universal hadron and lepton distribution functions without the need of any parameters other than the standard factorization scale. We discuss the necessary modification to DGLAP-type evolution of the parton and lepton distribution functions in this joint factorization approach. We also discuss the potential impact of this joint factorization approach on the extraction of partonic information from lepton-hadron DIS.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Excitation of $^{80}$Sr and the limits of the $N = Z = 40$ island of deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The region of $N\approx Z\approx 40$ has long been associated with strongly deformed nuclear configurations. The presence of this strong deformation was recently confirmed through lifetime measurements in $N\approx Z$ Sr and Zr nuclei. Theoretically, however, these nuclei present a challenge due to the vast valence space required to incorporate all deformation driving interactions. Recent state-of-the-art predictions indicate a near axial prolate deformation for $N=Z$ and $N=Z+2$ nuclei between $N=Z=36$ and $N=Z=40$. In this work we investigate the shores of this island of deformation through a sub-barrier Coulomb excitation study of the $N=Z+4$ nucleus, \textsuperscript{80}Sr. Extracting a spectroscopic quadrupole moment of $Q_s(2^+_1) = 0.45^{+0.83}_{-0.88}$~eb, we find that \textsuperscript{80}Sr is inconsistent with significant axial prolate deformation. This indicates that the predicted region of strong prolate deformation around $N=Z=40$ is tightly constrained to the quartet of nuclei: \textsuperscript{76,78}Sr and \textsuperscript{78,80}Zr.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative precision in functional QCD I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional approaches are the only first principle QCD setup that allow for direct computations at finite density. Predictive power and quantitative reliability of the respective results can only be obtained within a systematic expansion scheme with controlled systematic error estimates. Here we set up such a scheme within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach to QCD, aiming for full apparent convergence. In the current work we test this setup, using correlation functions and observables in 2+1 flavour vacuum QCD as a natural benchmark case. While the current work includes many evolutionary improvements collected over the past two decades, we also report on three novel important developments: (i) A comprehensive systematic error analysis based on the modular nature of the fRG approach. (ii) The introduction of a fully automated computational framework, allowing for unprecedented access and improvement of the fRG approach to QCD. (iii) The inclusion of the full effective potential of the chiral order parameter. This also gives access to all-order scattering events of pions and to the full momentum dependence of correlation functions, which is a first application of the automated computational framework (ii). The results compare very well to other state-of-the-art results both from functional approaches and lattice simulations, and provide data on general multi-scattering events of pions and the sigma mode for the first time.</description>

      <title>Higgs production at NLL accuracy in the BFKL approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision physics in the Higgs sector has been one of the main challenges of particle physics in the recent years. The pure fixed-order calculations entering the collinear factorization framework, which have been pushed up to next-cube-leading-order, are not able to describe the entire kinematic spectrum. In particular sectors, they have to be necessarily enhanced by all-order resummations. In the so-called semi-hard regime, large energy-type logarithms spoil the perturbative convergence of the series and must be resummed to all orders. This resummation is a core ingredient for a correct description of the inclusive hadroproduction of a forward Higgs boson in the limit of small Bjorken $x$, as well as for a precision study of inclusive forward emissions of a Higgs boson in association with a backward identified object. A complete resummation for these processes can be achieved at the at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy thanks to the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov approach. In the present work we present and discuss a series of recent phenomenological results within a partial next-to-leading accuracy. They include the analysis of rapidity and azimuthal-angle differential rates for Higgs plus jet and Higgs plus charm reactions in forward and ultraforward directions of rapidity at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Hints of Entanglement Suppression in Hyperon-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperon ($Y=\Sigma,\Lambda$)-nucleon ($N=n,p$) interactions are crucial for understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses. Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study $YN$ scatterings from the perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in $np$ scattering and leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight flavor channels in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, similar to the $np$ case. One exception is the $\Sigma^+p$ channel, where conflicting global fits lead to inconclusive outcome. We then propose ''quantum'' observables in $\Sigma^+p$ scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy Nuclear Spin Dependent Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory at the singles and doubles approximation has been implemented to estimate nuclear spin dependent (NSD) parity violating (PV) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes ($E1_{PV}^{NSD}$) among hyperfine levels of the $6s ~^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in $^{133}$Cs. To validate our calculations, we reproduce the Dirac-Hartree-Fock values and results from the combined coupled-Dirac-Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation (CPDF-RPA) method reported earlier. Contributions from the double-core-polarization (DCP) effects at the CPDF-RPA method were found to be between 3-12\% among different hyperfine levels. We derived a generalized expression for $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$, which helped incorporate both the NSD PV Hamiltonian and E1 operator simultaneously in the perturbative approach to account for the DCP contributions. The RCC method subsumes the CPDF-RPA and DCP effects in addition to contributions from the Br\"uckner pair-correlations and normalization of the wave functions, and correlations among them. To improve accuracy of the $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$ amplitudes further, we replace the {\it ab initio} values of the E1 matrix elements and energies by their experimental values via a sum-over-states approach.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double-copy in the Regge regime: shock wave propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>
