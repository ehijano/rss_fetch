      <title>On Graph Theory vs. Time-Domain Discrete Event Simulation for Topology-Informed Assessment of Power Grid Cyber Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift toward more renewable energy sources and distributed generation in smart grids has underscored the significance of modeling and analyzing modern power systems as cyber-physical systems (CPS). This transformation has highlighted the importance of cyber and cyber-physical properties of modern power systems for their reliable operation. Graph theory emerges as a pivotal tool for understanding the complex interactions within these systems, providing a framework for representation and analysis. The challenge is vetting these graph theoretic methods and other estimates of system behavior from mathematical models against reality. High-fidelity emulation and/or simulation can help answer this question, but the comparisons have been understudied. This paper employs graph-theoretic metrics to assess node risk and criticality in three distinct case studies, using a Python-based discrete-event simulation called SimPy. Results for each case study show that combining graph theory and simulation provides a topology-informed security assessment. These tools allow us to identify critical network nodes and evaluate their performance and reliability under a cyber threat such as denial of service threats.</description>

      <title>On pattern formation in the thermodynamically-consistent variational Gray-Scott model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore pattern formation in a four-species variational Gary-Scott model, which includes all reverse reactions and introduces a virtual species to describe the birth-death process in the classical Gray-Scott model. This modification transforms the classical Gray-Scott model into a thermodynamically consistent closed system. The classical two-species Gray-Scott model can be viewed as a subsystem of the variational Gray-Scott model in the limiting case when the small parameter $\epsilon$, related to the reaction rate of the reverse reactions, approaches zero. We numerically study the physically more complete Gray-Scott model with various $\epsilon$ in one dimension. By decreasing $\epsilon$, we observed that the stationary pattern in the classical Gray-Scott model can be stabilized as the transient state in the variational model for a significantly small $\epsilon$. Additionally, the variational model admits oscillated and traveling-wave-like pattern for small $\epsilon$. The persistent time of these patterns is on the order of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. We also analyze the stability of two uniform steady states in the variational Gary-Scott model for fixed $\epsilon$. Although both states are stable in a certain sense, the gradient flow type dynamics of the variational model exhibit a selection effect based on the initial conditions, with pattern formation occurring only if the initial condition does not converge to the boundary steady state, which corresponds to the trivial uniform steady state in the classical Gray-Scott model.</description>

      <title>Harnessing physics-informed operators for high-dimensional reliability analysis problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability analysis is a formidable task, particularly in systems with a large number of stochastic parameters. Conventional methods for quantifying reliability often rely on extensive simulations or experimental data, which can be costly and time-consuming, especially when dealing with systems governed by complex physical laws which necessitates computationally intensive numerical methods such as finite element or finite volume techniques. On the other hand, surrogate-based methods offer an efficient alternative for computing reliability by approximating the underlying model from limited data. Neural operators have recently emerged as effective surrogates for modelling physical systems governed by partial differential equations. These operators can learn solutions to PDEs for varying inputs and parameters. Here, we investigate the efficacy of the recently developed physics-informed wavelet neural operator in solving reliability analysis problems. In particular, we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed operator for solving high-dimensional reliability analysis problems, while bypassing the need for any simulation. Through four numerical examples, we illustrate that physics-informed operator can seamlessly solve high-dimensional reliability analysis problems with reasonable accuracy, while eliminating the need for running expensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Tailored Finite Point Operator Networks for Interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface problems pose significant challenges due to the discontinuity of their solutions, particularly when they involve singular perturbations or high-contrast coefficients, resulting in intricate singularities that complicate resolution. The increasing adoption of deep learning techniques for solving partial differential equations has spurred our exploration of these methods for addressing interface problems. In this study, we introduce Tailored Finite Point Operator Networks (TFPONets) as a novel approach for tackling parameterized interface problems. Leveraging DeepONets and integrating the Tailored Finite Point method (TFPM), TFPONets offer enhanced accuracy in reconstructing solutions without the need for intricate equation manipulation. Experimental analyses conducted in both one- and two-dimensional scenarios reveal that, in comparison to existing methods such as DeepONet and IONet, TFPONets demonstrate superior learning and generalization capabilities even with limited locations.</description>

      <title>High order Asymptotic Preserving penalized numerical schemes for the Euler-Poisson system in the quasi-neutral limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the development of high-order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) finite volume numerical methods for plasmas in quasineutral regimes. At large temporal and spatial scales, plasmas tend to be quasineutral, meaning that the local net charge density is nearly zero. However, at small time and spatial scales, measured by the the Debye length, quasineutrality breaks down. In such regimes, standard numerical methods face severe stability constraints, rendering them practically unusable. To address this issue, we introduce and analyze a class of penalized IMEX Runge-Kutta methods for the Euler-Poisson (EP) system, specifically designed to handle the quasineutral limit. These schemes are uniformly stable with respect to the Debye length and degenerate into high-order methods as the quasineutral limit is approached. Several numerical tests confirm that the proposed methods exhibit the desired properties.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent method with convex penalty for ill-posed problems in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic gradient descent method for solving inverse problems that can be written as systems of linear or nonlinear ill-posed equations in Banach spaces. The method uses only a randomly selected equation at each iteration and employs the convex function as the penalty term, and thus it is scalable to the problem size and has the ability to detect special features of solutions such as nonnegativity and piecewise constancy. To suppress the oscillation in iterates and reduce the semi-convergence of such methods, by incorporating the spirit of discrepancy principle, an adaptive strategy for choosing the step size is suggested. Under certain conditions, we establish the regularization results of the method under an {\it a priori} stopping rule. Several numerical simulations on computed tomography and schlieren imaging are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Finally, we study an {\it a posteriori} stopping rule for SGD-$\theta$ method and show the finite iterations termination property.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of the Euler's method for stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise via relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp error estimate of the density under the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) for the traditional Euler-Maruyama discretization of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with multiplicative noise. The foundation of the proof is the estimates of the derivatives for the logarithmic numerical density. The key technique is to adopt the Malliavin calculus to get the expressions of the derivatives of the logarithmic Green's function and to obtain an estimate for the inverse Malliavin matrix. The estimate of relative entropy then naturally gives sharp error bounds under total variation distance and Wasserstein distances. Compared to the usual weak error estimate for SDEs, such estimate can give an error bound for a family of test functions instead of one test function.</description>

      <title>A Power-like Method for Computing the Dominant Eigenpairs of Large Scale Real Skew-Symmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power method is a basic method for computing the dominant eigenpair of a matrix. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving power-like method for computing the dominant conjugate pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a large skew-symmetric matrix S, which works on S and its transpose alternately and is performed in real arithmetic. We establish the rigorous and quantitative convergence of the proposed power-like method, and prove that the approximations to the dominant eigenvalues converge twice as fast as those to the associated eigenvectors. Moreover, we develop a deflation technique to compute several complex conjugate dominant eigenpairs of S. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the new method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proved convergence rates of linear sampling recovery by extended least squares methods of functions in Bochner space satisfying some $\ell_2$-summability of their generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients. As applications we derive convergence rates of linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs with random inputs, and of infinite dimensional holomorphic functions. These convergence rates significantly improve the known results.</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part I: Steady Linear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present an approach where the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate the working of this method using the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), however, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <title>Inner Product Free Krylov Methods for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce two new Krylov subspace methods for solving rectangular large-scale linear inverse problems. The first approach is a modification of the Hessenberg iterative algorithm that is based off an LU factorization and is therefore referred to as the least squares LU (LSLU) method. The second approach incorporates Tikhonov regularization in an efficient manner; we call this the Hybrid LSLU method. Both methods are inner-product free, making them advantageous for high performance computing and mixed precision arithmetic. Theoretical findings and numerical results show that Hybrid LSLU can be effective in solving large-scale inverse problems and has comparable performance with existing iterative projection methods.</description>

      <title>Differential Inversion of the Implicit Euler Method: Symbolic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implicit Euler method integrates systems of ordinary differential equations $$\frac{d x}{d t}=G(t,x(t))$$ with differentiable right-hand side $G : R \times R^n \rightarrow R^n$ from an initial state $x=x(0) \in R^n$ to a target time $t \in R$ as $x(t)=E(t,m,x)$ using an equidistant discretization of the time interval $[0,t]$ yielding $m&gt;0$ time steps. We aim to compute the product of its inverse Jacobian $$
  (E')^{-1} \equiv
  \left (\frac{d E}{d x}\right )^{-1} \in R^{n \times n}
  $$
  with a given vector efficiently. We show that the differential inverse $(E')^{-1} \cdot v$ can be evaluated for given $v \in R^n$ with a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^2)$ as opposed to the standard $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^3)$ or, naively, even $\mathcal{O}(m \cdot n^4).$ The theoretical results are supported by actual run times. A reference implementation is provided.</description>

      <title>A relaxation approach to the coupling of a two-phase fluid with a linear-elastic solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed coupling strategy for two nonconservative hyperbolic systems is employed to investigate a collapsing vapor bubble embedded in a liquid near a solid. For this purpose, an elastic solid modeled by a linear system of conservation laws is coupled to the two-phase Baer-Nunziato-type model for isothermal fluids, a nonlinear hyperbolic system with non-conservative products. For the coupling of the two systems the Jin-Xin relaxation concept is employed and embedded in a second order finite volume scheme. For a proof of concept simulations in one space dimension are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-level trust-region method (TLTR) for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. Our method uses a composite iteration step, which is based on two distinct search directions. The first search direction is obtained through minimization in the full/high-resolution space, ensuring global convergence to a critical point. The second search direction is obtained through minimization in the randomly generated subspace, which, in turn, allows for convergence acceleration. The efficiency of the proposed TLTR method is demonstrated through numerical experiments in the field of machine learning</description>

      <title>A divergence-free projection method for quasiperiodic photonic crystals in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a point-wise divergence-free projection method for numerical approximations of photonic quasicrystals problems. The original three-dimensional quasiperiodic Maxwell's system is transformed into a periodic one in higher dimensions through a variable substitution involving the projection matrix, such that periodic boundary condition can be readily applied. To deal with the intrinsic divergence-free constraint of the Maxwell's equations, we present a quasiperiodic de Rham complex and its associated commuting diagram, based on which a point-wise divergence-free quasiperiodic Fourier spectral basis is proposed. With the help of this basis, we then propose an efficient solution algorithm for the quasiperiodic source problem and conduct its rigorous error estimate. Moreover, by analyzing the decay rate of the Fourier coefficients of the eigenfunctions, we further propose a divergence-free reduced projection method for the quasiperiodic Maxwell eigenvalue problem, which significantly alleviates the computational cost. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>DeepTV: A neural network approach for total variation minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular. In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On a shrink-and-expand technique for block eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In block eigenvalue algorithms, such as the subspace iteration algorithm and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) algorithm, a large block size is often employed to achieve robustness and rapid convergence. However, using a large block size also increases the computational cost. Traditionally, the block size is typically reduced after convergence of some eigenpairs, known as deflation. In this work, we propose a non-deflation-based, more aggressive technique, where the block size is adjusted dynamically during the algorithm. This technique can be applied to a wide range of block eigensolvers, reducing computational cost without compromising convergence speed. We present three adaptive strategies for adjusting the block size, and apply them to four well-known eigensolvers as examples. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed technique. In practice, an overall acceleration of 20% to 30% is observed.</description>

      <title>Communication in Multiplex Transportation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks are made up of vertices and edges. The edges, which may be directed or undirected, are equipped with positive weights. Modeling complex systems that consist of different types of objects leads to multilayer networks, in which vertices in distinct layers represent different kinds of objects. Multiplex networks are special vertex-aligned multilayer networks, in which vertices in distinct layers are identified with each other and inter-layer edges connect each vertex with its copy in other layers and have a fixed weight $\gamma&gt;0$ associated with the ease of communication between layers. This paper discusses two different approaches to analyze communication in a multiplex. One approach focuses on the multiplex global efficiency by using the multiplex path length matrix, the other approach considers the multiplex total communicability. The sensitivity of both the multiplex global efficiency and the multiplex total communicability to structural perturbations in the network is investigated to help to identify intra-layer edges that should be strengthened to enhance communicability.</description>

      <title>Uniform Approximation of Eigenproblems of a Large-Scale Parameter-Dependent Hermitian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of the smallest eigenvalue of a large parameter-dependent Hermitian matrix over a continuum compact domain. Our approach is based on approximating the smallest eigenvalue by the one obtained by projecting the large matrix onto a suitable small subspace, a practice widely employed in the literature. The projection subspaces are constructed iteratively (to reduce the error of the approximation where it is large) with the addition of the eigenvectors of the parameter-dependent matrix at the parameter values where a surrogate error is maximal. The surrogate error is the gap between the approximation and a lower bound for the smallest eigenvalue proposed in [Sirkovic and Kressner, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 37(2), 2016]. Unlike the classical approaches, such as the successive constraint method, that maximize such surrogate errors over a discrete and finite set, we maximize the surrogate error over the continuum of all permissible parameter values globally. We put particular attention to the lower bound, which enables us to formally prove the global convergence of our framework both in finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings. In the second part, we focus on the approximation of the smallest singular value of a large parameter-dependent matrix, in case it is non-Hermitian, and propose another subspace framework to construct a small parameter-dependent non-Hermitian matrix whose smallest singular value approximates the original large-scale smallest singular value. We perform numerical experiments on synthetic examples, as well as on real examples arising from parametric PDEs. The numerical experiments show that the proposed techniques are able to drastically reduce the size of the large parameter-dependent matrix, while ensuring an approximation error for the smallest eigenvalue/singular value below the prescribed tolerance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Preserving Linearly Implicit Additive IMEX-RK Finite Volume Schemes for Low Mach Number Isentropic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics with isentropic equation of state. In the low Mach number regime i.e. when the fluid velocity is very very small in comparison to the sound speed in the medium, the solution of the compressible system converges to the solution of its incompressible counter part. Standard numerical schemes fail to respect this transition property and hence are plagued with inaccuracies as well as instabilities. In this paper we introduce an extra flux term to the momentum flux. This extra term is brought to fore by looking at the incompressibility constraints of the asymptotic limit system. This extra flux term enables us to get a suitable flux splitting, so that an additive IMEX-RK scheme could be applied. Using an elliptic reformulation the scheme boils down to just solving a linear elliptic problem for the density and then explicit updates for the momentum. The IMEX schemes developed are shown to be formally asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit of the Euler equations. A second order space time fully discrete scheme is obtained in the finite volume framework using a combination of Rusanov flux for the explicit part and simple central differences for the implicit part. Numerical results are reported which elucidate the theoretical assertions regarding the scheme and its robustness.</description>

      <title>Component Fourier Neural Operator for Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations (SPDEs) poses computational challenges arising from the rapid transitions in their solutions within thin regions. The effectiveness of deep learning in addressing differential equations motivates us to employ these methods for solving SPDEs. In this manuscript, we introduce Component Fourier Neural Operator (ComFNO), an innovative operator learning method that builds upon Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), while simultaneously incorporating valuable prior knowledge obtained from asymptotic analysis. Our approach is not limited to FNO and can be applied to other neural network frameworks, such as Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), leading to potential similar SPDEs solvers. Experimental results across diverse classes of SPDEs demonstrate that ComFNO significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla FNO. Furthermore, ComFNO exhibits natural adaptability to diverse data distributions and performs well in few-shot scenarios, showcasing its excellent generalization ability in practical situations.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretization of Maxwell's equations in nonlinear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple Hamiltonian modeling framework for general models in nonlinear optics is given. This framework is specialized to describe the Hamiltonian structure of electromagnetic phenomena in cubicly nonlinear optical media. The model has a simple Poisson bracket structure with the Hamiltonian encoding all of the nonlinear coupling of the fields. The field-independence of the Poisson bracket facilitates a straightforward Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretization using finite element exterior calculus. The generality and relative simplicity of this Hamiltonian framework makes it amenable for simulating a broad class of time-domain nonlinear optical problems. The main contribution of this work is a finite element discretization of Maxwell's equations in cubicly nonlinear media which is energy-stable and exactly conserves Gauss's laws. Moreover, this approach may be readily adapted to consider more general nonlinear media in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Learning nonnegative matrix factorizations from compressed data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a flexible and theoretically supported framework for scalable nonnegative matrix factorization. The goal is to find nonnegative low-rank components directly from compressed measurements, accessing the original data only once or twice. We consider compression through randomized sketching methods that can be adapted to the data, or can be oblivious. We formulate optimization problems that only depend on the compressed data, but which can recover a nonnegative factorization which closely approximates the original matrix. The defined problems can be approached with a variety of algorithms, and in particular, we discuss variations of the popular multiplicative updates method for these compressed problems. We demonstrate the success of our approaches empirically and validate their performance in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05030v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses critical challenges in machine learning, particularly the stability, consistency, and convergence of neural networks under non-IID data, distribution shifts, and high-dimensional settings. We provide new theoretical results on uniform stability for neural networks with dynamic learning rates in non-convex settings. Further, we establish consistency bounds for federated learning models in non-Euclidean spaces, accounting for distribution shifts and curvature effects. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we derive stability, consistency, and convergence guarantees for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in noisy environments. These results fill significant gaps in understanding model behavior in complex, non-ideal conditions, paving the way for more robust and reliable machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new efficient particle method for the numerical simulation of crystallization and precipitation at the pore scale of real rock geometries extracted by X-Ray tomography. It is based on the coupling between superficial velocity models of porous media, Lagrangian description of chemistry using Transition-State-Theory, involving underlying grids. Its ability to successfully compute dissolution process has been established in the past and is presently generalized to precipitation and crystallization by means of adsorption modeling. Numerical simulations of mineral CO2 trapping are provided, showing evidence of clogging/non-clogging regimes, and one of the main results is the introduction of a new non-dimensional number needed for this characterization.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of a generic tamed Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for the kinetic type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) (also known as second order SDEs) with singular coefficients in both weak and strong probabilistic senses. We show that when the drift exhibits a relatively low regularity compared to the state of the art, the singular system is well-defined both in the weak and strong probabilistic senses. Meanwhile, the corresponding tamed EM scheme is shown to converge at the rate of 1/2 in both the weak and the strong senses.</description>

      <title>Real-time optimal control of high-dimensional parametrized systems by deep learning-based reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steering a system towards a desired target in a very short amount of time is challenging from a computational standpoint. Indeed, the intrinsically iterative nature of optimal control problems requires multiple simulations of the physical system to be controlled. Moreover, the control action needs to be updated whenever the underlying scenario undergoes variations. Full-order models based on, e.g., the Finite Element Method, do not meet these requirements due to the computational burden they usually entail. On the other hand, conventional reduced order modeling techniques such as the Reduced Basis method, are intrusive, rely on a linear superimposition of modes, and lack of efficiency when addressing nonlinear time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Modeling (DL-ROM) technique for the rapid control of systems described in terms of parametrized PDEs in multiple scenarios. In particular, optimal full-order snapshots are generated and properly reduced by either Proper Orthogonal Decomposition or deep autoencoders (or a combination thereof) while feedforward neural networks are exploited to learn the map from scenario parameters to reduced optimal solutions. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction therefore allows us to consider state variables and control actions that are both low-dimensional and distributed. After (i) data generation, (ii) dimensionality reduction, and (iii) neural networks training in the offline phase, optimal control strategies can be rapidly retrieved in an online phase for any scenario of interest. The computational speedup and the high accuracy obtained with the proposed approach are assessed on different PDE-constrained optimization problems, ranging from the minimization of energy dissipation in incompressible flows modelled through Navier-Stokes equations to the thermal active cooling in heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Tensor BM-Decomposition for Compression and Analysis of Video Data</title>

Abstract: Given tensors $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{A}}, \boldsymbol{\mathscr{B}}, \boldsymbol{\mathscr{C}}$ of size $m \times 1 \times n$, $m \times p \times 1$, and $1\times p \times n$, respectively, their Bhattacharya-Mesner (BM) product will result in a third-order tensor of dimension $m \times p \times n$ and BM-rank of 1 (Mesner and Bhattacharya, 1990). Thus, if an arbitrary $m \times p \times n$ third-order tensor can be written as a sum of a small number, relative to $m,p,n$, of such BM-rank 1 terms, this BM-decomposition (BMD) offers an implicitly compressed representation of the tensor. In this paper, we first show that grayscale surveillance video can be accurately captured by a low BM-rank decomposition and give methods for efficiently computing this decomposition. To this end, we first give results that connect rank-revealing matrix factorizations to the BMD. Next, we present a generative model that illustrates that spatio-temporal video data can be expected to have low BM-rank. We combine these observations to derive a regularized alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to compute an approximate BMD of the video tensor. The algorithm itself is highly parallelizable since the bulk of the computations break down into relatively small regularized least squares problems that can be solved independently. Extensive numerical results compared against the state-of-the-art matrix-based DMD for surveillance video separation show our algorithms can consistently produce results with superior compression properties while simultaneously providing better separation of stationary and non-stationary features in the data. We then introduce a new type of BM-product suitable for color video and provide an algorithm that shows an impressive ability to extract important temporal information from color video while simultaneously compressing the data.</description>

      <title>Computable error bounds for quasi-Monte Carlo using points with non-negative local discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:[0,1]^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be a completely monotone integrand as defined by Aistleitner and Dick (2015) and let points $\boldsymbol{x}_0,\dots,\boldsymbol{x}_{n-1}\in[0,1]^d$ have a non-negative local discrepancy (NNLD) everywhere in $[0,1]^d$. We show how to use these properties to get a non-asymptotic and computable upper bound for the integral of $f$ over $[0,1]^d$. An analogous non-positive local discrepancy (NPLD) property provides a computable lower bound. It has been known since Gabai (1967) that the two dimensional Hammersley points in any base $b\ge2$ have non-negative local discrepancy. Using the probabilistic notion of associated random variables, we generalize Gabai's finding to digital nets in any base $b\ge2$ and any dimension $d\ge1$ when the generator matrices are permutation matrices. We show that permutation matrices cannot attain the best values of the digital net quality parameter when $d\ge3$. As a consequence the computable absolutely sure bounds we provide come with less accurate estimates than the usual digital net estimates do in high dimensions. We are also able to construct high dimensional rank one lattice rules that are NNLD. We show that those lattices do not have good discrepancy properties: any lattice rule with the NNLD property in dimension $d\ge2$ either fails to be projection regular or has all its points on the main diagonal. Complete monotonicity is a very strict requirement that for some integrands can be mitigated via a control variate.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based inversion for stress and frictional parameters in earthquake modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12279v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an adjoint-based optimization method to invert for stress and frictional parameters used in earthquake modeling. The forward problem is linear elastodynamics with nonlinear rate-and-state frictional faults. The misfit functional quantifies the difference between simulated and measured particle displacements or velocities at receiver locations. The misfit may include windowing or filtering operators. We derive the corresponding adjoint problem, which is linear elasticity with linearized rate-and-state friction and, for forward problems involving fault normal stress changes, nonzero fault opening, with time-dependent coefficients derived from the forward solution. The gradient of the misfit is efficiently computed by convolving forward and adjoint variables on the fault. The method thus extends the framework of full-waveform inversion to include frictional faults with rate-and-state friction. In addition, we present a space-time dual-consistent discretization of a dynamic rupture problem with a rough fault in antiplane shear, using high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite differences in combination with explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The dual consistency of the discretization ensures that the discrete adjoint-based gradient is the exact gradient of the discrete misfit functional as well as a consistent approximation of the continuous gradient. Our theoretical results are corroborated by inversions with synthetic data. We anticipate that adjoint-based inversion of seismic and/or geodetic data will be a powerful tool for studying earthquake source processes; it can also be used to interpret laboratory friction experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the role of generalized continuum mechanics, and the feasibility of model-free data-driven computing approaches thereof, in solids undergoing failure by strain localization. Specifically, we set forth a methodology for capturing material instabilities using data-driven mechanics without prior information regarding the failure mode. We show numerically that, in problems involving strain localization, the standard data-driven framework for Cauchy/Boltzmann continua fails to capture the length scale of the material, as expected. We address this shortcoming by formulating a generalized data-driven framework for micromorphic continua that effectively captures both stiffness and length-scale information, as encoded in the material data, in a model-free manner. These properties are exhibited systematically in a one-dimensional softening bar problem and further verified through selected plane-strain problems.</description>

      <title>Projection method for quasiperiodic elliptic equations and application to quasiperiodic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, our main objective is to address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multi-level block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the spectral accuracy of our proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.</description>

      <title>Reorthogonalized Pythagorean variants of block classical Gram-Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) is commonly used for orthogonalizing a set of vectors $X$ in distributed computing environments due to its favorable communication properties relative to other orthogonalization approaches, such as modified Gram-Schmidt or Householder. However, it is known that BCGS (as well as recently developed low-synchronization variants of BCGS) can suffer from a significant loss of orthogonality in finite-precision arithmetic, which can contribute to instability and inaccurate solutions in downstream applications such as $s$-step Krylov subspace methods. A common solution to improve the orthogonality among the vectors is reorthogonalization. Focusing on the "Pythagorean" variant of BCGS, introduced in [E. Carson, K. Lund, &amp; M. Rozlo\v{z}n\'{i}k. SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 42(3), pp. 1365--1380, 2021], which guarantees an $O(\varepsilon)\kappa^2(X)$ bound on the loss of orthogonality as long as $O(\varepsilon)\kappa^2(X)&lt;1$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the unit roundoff, we introduce and analyze two reorthogonalized Pythagorean BCGS variants. These variants feature favorable communication properties, with asymptotically two synchronization points per block column, as well as an improved $O(\varepsilon)$ bound on the loss of orthogonality. Our bounds are derived in a general fashion to additionally allow for the analysis of mixed-precision variants. We verify our theoretical results with a panel of test matrices and experiments from a new version of the \texttt{BlockStab} toolbox.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the Westervelt quasilinear wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic-preserving properties of a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the Westervelt model of ultrasound waves. More precisely, we show that the proposed method is robust with respect to small values of the sound diffusivity damping parameter $\delta$ by deriving low- and high-order energy stability estimates, and \emph{a priori} error bounds that are independent of $\delta$. Such bounds are then used to show that, when $\delta \rightarrow 0^+$, the method remains stable and the discrete acoustic velocity potential $\psi_h^{(\delta)}$ converges to $\psi_h^{(0)}$, where the latter is the singular vanishing dissipation limit. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence rates for the approximation of the acoustic particle velocity variable $\boldsymbol{v} = \nabla \psi$. The established theoretical results are illustrated with some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Combining physics-informed graph neural network and finite difference for solving forward and inverse spatiotemporal PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The great success of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has significantly advanced our simulation and understanding of complex physical systems in science and engineering. However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.</description>

      <title>Unexpected fault activation in underground gas storage. Part II: Definition of safe operational bandwidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground gas storage is a versatile tool for managing energy resources and addressing pressing environmental concerns. While natural gas is stored in geological formations since the beginning of the 20th century, hydrogen has recently been considered as a potential candidate toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, these formations can also be used to sequester environmentally harmful gases such as CO2. When such operations are implemented in faulted basins, however, safety concerns may arise due to the possible reactivation of pre-existing faults, which could result in (micro)-seismicity events. In the Netherlands, it has been recently noted that fault reactivation can occur "unexpectedly" during the life of an underground gas storage (UGS) site, even when stress conditions are not expected to cause a failure. The present two-part work aims to develop a modeling framework to investigate the physical mechanisms causing such occurrences and define a safe operational bandwidth for pore pressure variation for UGS operations in the faulted reservoirs of the Rotliegend formation, the Netherlands. In this follow-up paper, we investigate in detail the mechanisms and crucial factors that result in fault reactivation at various stages of a UGS. The mathematical and numerical model described in Part I is used, also accounting for the effect of geochemical dissolution on reservoir and caprock weakening. TThe study investigates the risks of fault activation caused by the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as long-term CO2 sequestration, CH4 and N2 injection and extraction cycles, and N2 permanent storage. The results show how geomechanical properties and reservoir operating conditions may increase the risk of fault reactivation at various UGS stages. Finally, operational guidelines for improving secure storage operations are presented.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Angular Domain Compression Scheme For Solving Multiscale Radiative Transfer Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with the steady-state multiscale radiative transfer equation (RTE) with heterogeneous coefficients, spatially localized low-rank structures are present in the angular space. This paper introduces an adaptive tailored finite point scheme (TFPS) for RTEs in heterogeneous media, which can adaptively compress the angular space. It does so by selecting reduced TFPS basis functions based on the local optical properties of the background media. These reduced basis functions capture the important local modes in the velocity domain. A detailed a posteriori error analysis is performed to quantify the discrepancy between the reduced and full TFPS solutions. Additionally, numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the adaptive TFPS in solving multiscale RTEs, especially in scenarios involving boundary and interface layers.</description>

      <title>Novel Approach for solving the discrete Stokes problems based on Augmented Lagrangian and Global Techniques: Application to Saddle-Point Linear Systems from Incompressible flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel augmented Lagrangian preconditioner based on global Arnoldi for accelerating the convergence of Krylov subspace methods applied to linear systems of equations with a block three-by-three structure, these systems typically arise from discretizing the Stokes equations using mixed-finite element methods. In practice, the components of velocity are always approximated using a single finite element space. More precisely, in two dimensions, our new approach based on standard space of scalar finite element basis functions to discretize the velocity space. This componentwise splitting can be shown to induce a natural block three-by-three structure. Spectral analyses is established for the exact versions of these preconditioners. Finally, the obtained numerical results claim that our novel approach is more efficient and robust for solving the discrete Stokes problems. The efficiency of our new approach is evaluated by measuring computational time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of relaxation parameter in the projected successive overrelaxation (PSOR) method for nonnegative quadratic programming problems is problem-dependent. We present novel adaptive PSOR algorithms that adaptively control the relaxation parameter using the Wolfe conditions. The method and its variants can be applied to various problems without requiring additional assumptions, barring the positive semidefiniteness concerning the matrix that defines the objective function, and the cost for updating the parameter is negligible in the whole iteration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods often perform comparably to (or sometimes superior to) the PSOR method with a nearly optimal relaxation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear boolean equation systems play an important role in a wide range of applications. Grover's algorithm is one of the best-known quantum search algorithms in solving the nonlinear boolean equation system on quantum computers. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to improve the efficiency under Grover's algorithm framework. A W-cycle circuit construction introduces a recursive idea to increase the solvable number of boolean equations given a fixed number of qubits. Then, a greedy compression technique is proposed to reduce the oracle circuit depth. Finally, a randomized Grover's algorithm randomly chooses a subset of equations to form a random oracle every iteration, which further reduces the circuit depth and the number of ancilla qubits. Numerical results on boolean quadratic equations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification under Noisy Constraints, with Applications to Raking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider statistical inference problems under uncertain equality constraints, and provide asymptotically valid uncertainty estimates for inferred parameters. The proposed approach leverages the implicit function theorem and primal-dual optimality conditions for a particular problem class. The motivating application is multi-dimensional raking, where observations are adjusted to match marginals; for example, adjusting estimated deaths across race, county, and cause in order to match state all-race all-cause totals. We review raking from a convex optimization perspective, providing explicit primal-dual formulations, algorithms, and optimality conditions for a wide array of raking applications, which are then leveraged to obtain the uncertainty estimates. Empirical results show that the approach obtains, at the cost of a single solve, nearly the same uncertainty estimates as computationally intensive Monte Carlo techniques that pass thousands of observed and of marginal draws through the entire raking process.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>
