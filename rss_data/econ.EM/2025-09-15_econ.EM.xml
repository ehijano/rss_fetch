      <title>Smooth Tests for Normality in ANOVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The normality assumption for random errors is fundamental in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, yet it is rarely formally tested in practice. In this paper, we propose Neyman's smooth tests for assessing the normality assumption across various types of ANOVA models. The proposed test statistics are constructed based on the Gaussian probability integral transformation of ANOVA residuals. Under the null hypothesis of normality, the test statistics are asymptotically Chi-square distributed, with degrees of freedom determined by the dimension of the smooth model (the number of orthonormal functions). A data-driven selection of the model dimension using a modified Schwarz's criterion is also discussed. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Logs and Zeros in Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log transformation is widely used in linear regression, mainly because coefficients are interpretable as proportional effects. Yet this practice has fundamental limitations, most notably that the log is undefined at zero, creating an identification problem. We propose a new estimator, iterated OLS (iOLS), which targets the normalized average treatment effect, preserving the percentage-change interpretation while addressing these limitations. Our procedure is the theoretically justified analogue of the ad-hoc log(1+Y) transformation and delivers a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameters of the exponential conditional mean model. iOLS is computationally efficient, globally convergent, and free of the incidental-parameter bias, while extending naturally to endogenous regressors through iterated 2SLS. We illustrate the methods with simulations and revisit three influential publications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Multiple Long-Run Relations in Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature on panel cointegration is extensive but does not cover data sets where the cross section dimension, $n$, is larger than the time series dimension $T$. This paper proposes a novel methodology that filters out the short run dynamics using sub-sample time averages as deviations from their full-sample counterpart, and estimates the number of long-run relations and their coefficients using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the pooled covariance matrix of these sub-sample deviations. We refer to this procedure as pooled minimum eigenvalue (PME). We show that PME estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as $n$ and $T \rightarrow \infty$ jointly, such that $T\approx n^{d}$, with $d&gt;0$ for consistency and $d&gt;1/2$ for asymptotic normality. Extensive Monte Carlo studies show that the number of long-run relations can be estimated with high precision, and the PME estimators have good size and power properties. The utility of our approach is illustrated by micro and macro applications using Compustat and Penn World Tables.</description>
