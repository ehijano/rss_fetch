      <title>On the density of Toeplitz operators in the Toeplitz algebra over the Bergman space of the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use quantum harmonic analysis and representation theory to provide a new proof of Xia's theorem: "Toeplitz operators are norm dense in the Toeplitz algebra over the Bergman space of the unit ball."</description>

      <title>Computable $K$-theory for $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras: UHF algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the effective content of $K$-theory for $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We prove that there are computable functors which associate, to a computably enumerable presentation of a $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $\boldA$, computably enumerable presentations of the abelian groups $K_0(\boldA)$ and $K_1(\boldA)$. When $\boldA$ is stably finite, we show that the positive cone of $K_0(\boldA)$ is computably enumerable. We strengthen the results in the case that $\boldA$ is a UHF algebra by showing that the aforementioned presentation of $K_0(\boldA)$ is actually computable. In the UHF case, we also show that $\boldA$ has a computable presentation precisely when $K_0(\boldA)$ has a computable presentation, which in turn is equivalent to the supernatural number of $\boldA$ being lower semicomputable; we give an example that shows that this latter equivalence cannot be improved to requiring that the supernatural number of $\boldA$ is computable. Finally, we prove that every UHF algebra is computably categorical.</description>

      <title>The Lattice of C*-covers of an operator algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper it is shown that the lattice of C*-covers of an operator algebra does not contain enough information to distinguish operator algebras up to completely isometric isomorphism. In addition, four natural equivalences of the lattice of C*-covers are developed and proven to be distinct. The lattice of C*-covers of direct sums and tensor products are studied. Along the way key examples are found of an operator algebra that generates exactly n C*-algebras up to *-isomorphism and a simple operator algebra that is not similar to a C*-algebra.</description>

      <title>Weakly-monotone C*-algebras as Exel-Laca algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An abstract characterization of weakly monotone $C^*$-algebras, namely the concrete $C^*$-algebras generated by creators and annihilators acting on the so-called weakly monotone Fock spaces, is given in terms of (quotient of) suitable Exel-Laca algebras. The weakly monotone $C^*$-algebra indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ is shown to be a type-I $C^*$-algebra and its representation theory is entirely determined, whereas the weakly monotone $C^*$-algebra indexed by $\mathbb{Z}$ is shown not to be of type $I$.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability problems and algebras of boolean constraint system games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mermin and Peres showed that there are boolean constraint systems (BCSs) which are not satisfiable, but which are satisfiable with quantum observables. This has led to a burgeoning theory of quantum satisfiability for constraint systems, connected to nonlocal games and quantum contextuality. In this theory, different types of quantum satisfying assignments can be understood as representations of the BCS algebra of the system. This theory is closely related to the theory of synchronous games and algebras, and every synchronous algebra is a BCS algebra and vice-versa. The purpose of this paper is to further develop the role of BCS algebras in this theory, and tie up some loose ends: We give a new presentation of BCS algebras in terms of joint spectral projections, and show that it is equivalent to the standard definition. We construct a constraint system which is $C^*$-satisfiable but not tracially satisfiable. We show that certain reductions between constraint systems lead to $*$-homomorphisms between the BCS algebras of the systems, and use this to streamline and strengthen several results of Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini on analogues of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem. In particular, we show that the question of whether or not there is a non-hyperlinear group is linked to dichotomy theorems for $\mathcal{R}^{\mathcal{U}}$-satisfiability.</description>
