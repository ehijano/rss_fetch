      <title>Gender Imbalance in Physics Education and Employment in Germany: Trends and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender imbalance among German physicists persists, with fewer women in advanced degrees and research leadership roles. Although female enrollment in Physics programs increased slightly until 2022, potentially influenced by COVID-19 the long-term trend remains uncertain. Despite the rise in female Ph.D. students and foreign representation, female professors in Physics and Astronomy stagnated below 14 %, indicating significant underrepresentation. Anticipated revisions to the WissZeitVG law may impact female mainstreaming efforts, potentially leading to greater precarization of research staff. Women make up only around 20 % of employed physicists, with low visibility in the community, as seen in the representation of female physicists in prestigious awards. Addressing this imbalance requires structural interventions beyond mere encouragement and empowerment.</description>

      <title>Assessing Waste Heat Utilization in Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage Systems for Cost-Effective Building Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19403v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully electrifying the building sector requires not only the widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption and heat pumps, but also the integration of cost-effective energy storage solutions. Hybridizing lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with power to heat to power storage (PHPS) systems, thermal batteries capable of thermal-to-electric energy conversion, offers a promising and economically viable solution. PHPS systems dispatch combined heat and power by utilizing the low-temperature waste heat generated during the thermal to electric energy conversion process. This study investigates the technoeconomic impacts of waste heat use in PHPS systems integrated with Li-ion batteries and heat pumps to support the decarbonization of the building sector. Two distinct strategies are evaluated: direct use of waste heat to meet heating demands; and the use of waste heat to enhance the heat pump's coefficient of performance. Results show that supplying the waste heat at the demand setpoint temperature is the best solution to integrate PHPS cost-effectively, although enhancing the heat pump's COP with waste heat also yields notable economic gains. Additionally, leveraging waste heat significantly lowers the minimum thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency required for PHPS systems to achieve economic viability. Optimal PHPS designs enable large-scale energy storage and charging capacities, thereby enhancing PV self-consumption rates and reducing the levelized cost of energy. The analysis also reveals that hybridizing PHPS with Li-ion batteries may rise as the optimal solution for moderately priced PHPS systems, with the reduction in levelized cost being more pronounced in solar-dominated regions.</description>

      <title>How trust networks shape students' opinions about the proficiency of artificially intelligent assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising use of educational tools controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) has provoked a debate about their proficiency. While intrinsic proficiency, especially in tasks such as grading, has been measured and studied extensively, perceived proficiency remains underexplored. Here it is shown through Monte Carlo multi-agent simulations that trust networks among students influence their perceptions of the proficiency of an AI tool. A probabilistic opinion dynamics model is constructed, in which every student's perceptions are described by a probability density function (PDF), which is updated at every time step through independent, personal observations and peer pressure shaped by trust relationships. It is found that students infer correctly the AI tool's proficiency $\theta_{\rm AI}$ in allies-only networks (i.e.\ high trust networks). AI-avoiders reach asymptotic learning faster than AI-users, and the asymptotic learning time for AI-users decreases as their number increases. However, asymptotic learning is disrupted even by a single partisan, who is stubbornly incorrect in their belief $\theta_{\rm p} \neq \theta_{\rm AI}$, making other students' beliefs vacillate indefinitely between $\theta_{\rm p}$ and $\theta_{\rm AI}$. In opponents-only (low trust) networks, all students reach asymptotic learning, but only a minority infer $\theta_{\rm AI}$ correctly. AI-users have a small advantage over AI-avoiders in reaching the right conclusion. In mixed networks, students may exhibit turbulent nonconvergence and intermittency, or achieve asymptotic learning, depending on the relationships between partisans and AI-users. The educational implications of the results are discussed briefly in the context of designing robust usage policies for AI tools, with an emphasis on the unintended and inequitable consequences which arise sometimes from counterintuitive network effects.</description>

      <title>Entropy and type-token ratio in gigaword corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are different ways of measuring diversity in complex systems. In particular, in language, lexical diversity is characterized in terms of the type-token ratio and the word entropy. We here investigate both diversity metrics in six massive linguistic datasets in English, Spanish, and Turkish, consisting of books, news articles, and tweets. These gigaword corpora correspond to languages with distinct morphological features and differ in registers and genres, thus constituting a varied testbed for a quantitative approach to lexical diversity. We unveil an empirical functional relation between entropy and type-token ratio of texts of a given corpus and language, which is a consequence of the statistical laws observed in natural language. Further, in the limit of large text lengths we find an analytical expression for this relation relying on both Zipf and Heaps laws that agrees with our empirical findings.</description>
