      <title>$k$-Hyperopic Cops and Robber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of hyperopic cops and robber, analogous to the $k$-visibility cops and robber, is introduced in this paper. For a positive integer $k$ the $k$-hyperopic game of cops and robber is defined similarly as the usual cops and robber game, but with the robber being omniscient and invisible to the cops that are at distance at most $k$ away from the robber. The cops win the game if, after a finite number of rounds, a cop occupies the same vertex as robber. Otherwise, robber wins. The minimum number of cops needed to win the game on a graph $G$ is the $k$-hyperopic cop number $c_{H,k}(G)$ of $G$.
  In addition to basic properties of the new invariant, cop-win graphs are characterized and a general upper bound in terms of the matching number of the graph is given. The invariant is also studied on trees where the upper bounds mostly depend on the relation between $k$ and the diameter of the tree. It is also proven that the 2-hyperopic cop number of outerplanar graphs is at most 2 and an upper bound in terms of the number of vertices of the graph is presented for $k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_\mathrm{op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions becomes exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish for the first time that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the typical semicircle law. Our proofs rely on deriving concentration inequalities and large deviation properties for the law of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints, extending results in the literature and offering insights of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Gathering Information about a Graph by Counting Walks from a Single Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a vertex $v$ in a connected graph $G$ is decisive if the numbers of walks from $v$ of each length determine the graph $G$ rooted at $v$ up to isomorphism among all connected rooted graphs with the same number of vertices. On the other hand, $v$ is called ambivalent if it has the same walk counts as a vertex in a non-isomorphic connected graph with the same number of vertices as $G$. Using the classical constructions of cospectral trees, we first observe that ambivalent vertices exist in almost all trees. If a graph $G$ is determined by spectrum and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible, then we prove that all vertices of $G$ are decisive. Note that both assumptions are conjectured to be true for almost all graphs. Without using any assumption, we are able to prove that the vertices of a random graph are with high probability distinguishable from each other by the numbers of closed walks of length at most 4. As a consequence, the closed walk counts for lengths 2, 3, and 4 provide a canonical labeling of a random graph. Answering a question posed in chemical graph theory, we finally show that all walk counts for a vertex in an $n$-vertex graph are determined by the counts for the $2n$ shortest lengths, and the bound $2n$ is here asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for perfect mixed tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to study sufficient conditions for perfect mixed tilings. Our framework allows the embedding of bounded degree graphs $H$ with components of sublinear order. As a corollary, we recover and extend the work of K\"uhn and Osthus regarding sufficient minimum degree conditions for perfect $F$-tilings (for an arbitrary fixed graph $F$) by replacing the $F$-tiling with the aforementioned graphs $H$. Moreover, we obtain analogous results for degree sequences and in the setting of uniformly dense graphs. Finally, we asymptotically resolve a conjecture of Koml\'os in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Maximizing a Submodular Function with Bounded Curvature under an Unknown Knapsack Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under an unknown knapsack constraint. A solution to this problem is a policy that decides which item to pack next based on the past packing history. The robustness factor of a policy is the worst case ratio of the solution obtained by following the policy and an optimal solution that knows the knapsack capacity. We develop a policy with a robustness factor that is decreasing in the curvature $c$ of the submodular function. For the extreme cases $c=0$ corresponding to an additive objective function, it matches a previously known and best possible robustness factor of $1/2$. For the other extreme case of $c=1$ it yields a robustness factor of $\approx 0.35$ improving over the best previously known robustness factor of $\approx 0.06$.
  The analysis of our policy relies on a greedy algorithm that is a slight modification of Wolsey's greedy algorithm for the submodular knapsack problem with a known knapsack constraint. We obtain tight approximation guarantees for both of these algorithms in the setting of a submodular objective function with curvature $c$.</description>

      <title>Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the mathematical limits and algorithmic bounds for probabilistic group testing have become increasingly well-understood, with exact asymptotic thresholds now being known in general scaling regimes for the noiseless setting. In the noisy setting where each test outcome is flipped with constant probability, there have been similar developments, but the overall understanding has lagged significantly behind the noiseless setting. In this paper, we substantially narrow this gap by deriving exact asymptotic thresholds for the noisy setting under two widely-studied random test designs: i.i.d. Bernoulli and near-constant tests-per-item. These thresholds are established by combining components of an existing information-theoretic threshold decoder with a novel analysis of maximum-likelihood decoding (upper bounds), and deriving a novel set of impossibility results by analyzing certain failure events for optimal maximum-likelihood decoding (lower bounds).</description>

      <title>Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation with a Many-Body Physics Inspired Inductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tight bound for the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of tree minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree on $t$ vertices. We prove that for every positive integer $k$ and every graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs each having a $T$ minor, or there exists a set $X$ of at most $t(k-1)$ vertices of $G$ such that $G-X$ has no $T$ minor. The bound on the size of $X$ is best possible and improves on an earlier $f(t)k$ bound proved by Fiorini, Joret, and Wood (2013) with some fast growing function $f(t)$. Moreover, our proof is short and simple.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>Maximum Bipartite vs. Triangle-Free Subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a (multi)graph $G$ which contains a bipartite subgraph with $\rho$ edges, what is the largest triangle-free subgraph of $G$ that can be found efficiently? We present an SDP-based algorithm that finds one with at least $0.8823 \rho$ edges, thus improving on the subgraph with $0.878 \rho$ edges obtained by the classic Max-Cut algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. On the other hand, by a reduction from Hastad's 3-bit PCP we show that it is NP-hard to find a triangle-free subgraph with $(25 / 26 + \epsilon) \rho \approx (0.961 + \epsilon) \rho$ edges.
  As an application, we classify the Maximum Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem MaxPCSP($G$,$H$) for all bipartite $G$: Given an input (multi)graph $X$ which admits a $G$-colouring satisfying $\rho$ edges, find an $H$-colouring of $X$ that satisfies $\rho$ edges. This problem is solvable in polynomial time, apart from trivial cases, if $H$ contains a triangle, and is NP-hard otherwise.</description>
