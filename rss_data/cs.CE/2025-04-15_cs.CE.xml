      <title>Finding Pathways in Reaction Networks guided by Energy Barriers using Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing synthesis pathways for target molecules in a chemical reaction network annotated with information on the kinetics of individual reactions is an area of active study. This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</description>

      <title>Design and Verification of a Synchronus First In First Out (FIFO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project focuses on designing and verifying a synchronous FIFO First In First Out (FIFO) memory, a critical component in digital systems for temporary data storage and seamless data transfer. The FIFO operates under a single clock domain, ensuring synchronized read and write operations, making it suitable for systems requiring high-speed, reliable data buffering. This design includes FIFO's key features, such as read and write operations, full and empty flag generation, and pointer management for memory control. The FIFO was implemented using Verilog to define the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, ensuring functionality and timing requirements were met. For verification, three approaches were employed: (1) UVM-based Verification: A Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench was developed to test the FIFO design rigorously. The testbench includes components like interface, sequence item, driver, monitor, scoreboard, agent, and environment. Directed and random tests were performed to verify corner cases, such as simultaneous reads and writes, full and empty conditions, and overflow and underflow scenarios; (2) Traditional Verilog Testbench: A standalone Verilog testbench was also used to validate the functionality of the FIFO through directed test scenarios and waveform analysis; (3) FPGA implementation: Additionally, the design was implemented on an FPGA for real-time testing to verify its functionality and timing behavior in hardware. FPGA-based verification ensured the design performed as expected under practical conditions. The results confirmed the correct operation of the FIFO, including accurate data transfer, flag behavior, and timing synchronization. The project successfully demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the synchronous FIFO design, highlighting its importance in modern digital systems for efficient data handling and buffering.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Conforming Formulations for Foil Windings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the foil winding homogenization method to magnetic field conforming formulations. We first propose a full magnetic field foil winding formulation by analogy with magnetic flux density conforming formulations. We then introduce the magnetic scalar potential in non-conducting regions to improve the efficiency of the model. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, particularly in 3-D applications. The proposed models are verified on two frequency-domain benchmark problems: a 2-D axisymmetric problem and a 3-D problem. They reproduce results obtained with magnetic flux density conforming formulations and with resolved conductor models that explicitly discretize all turns. Moreover, the models are applied in the transient simulation of a high-temperature superconducting coil. In all investigated configurations, the proposed models provide reliable results while considerably reducing the size of the numerical problem to be solved.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and the Dual Paradoxes: Examining the Interplay of Efficiency, Resource Consumption, and Labor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence's (AI) rapid development and growth not only transformed industries but also fired up important debates about its impacts on employment, resource allocation, and the ethics involved in decision-making. It serves to understand how changes within an industry will be able to influence society with that change. Advancing AI technologies will create a dual paradox of efficiency, greater resource consumption, and displacement of traditional labor. In this context, we explore the impact of AI on energy consumption, human labor roles, and hybrid roles widespread human labor replacement. We used mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative analyses of data identified from various sources. Findings suggest that AI increases energy consumption and has impacted human labor roles to a minimal extent, considering that its applicability is limited to some tasks that require human judgment. In this context, the</description>

      <title>A study of troubled-cell indicators applied to finite volume methods using a novel monotonicity parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt a troubled-cell indicator developed for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to the finite volume method (FVM) framework for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. This indicator depends solely on the cell-average data of the target cell and its immediate neighbours. Once the troubled-cells are identified, we apply the limiter only in these cells instead of applying in all computational cells. We introduce a novel technique to quantify the quality of the solution in the neighbourhood of the shock by defining a monotonicity parameter $\mu$. Numerical results from various two-dimensional simulations on the hyperbolic systems of Euler equations using a finite volume solver employing MUSCL reconstruction validate the performance of the troubled-cell indicator and the approach of limiting only in the troubled-cells. These results show that limiting only in the troubled-cells is preferable to limiting everywhere as it improves convergence without compromising on the solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Intraday Power Trading for Single-Price Balancing Markets: An Adaptive Risk-Averse Strategy using Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bayesian model updating in structural health monitoring via learnable mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), the selection and extraction of damage-sensitive features from raw sensor recordings represent a critical step towards solving the inverse problem underlying the identification of structural health conditions. This work introduces a novel approach that employs deep neural networks to enhance stochastic SHM methods. A learnable feature extractor and a feature-oriented surrogate model are synergistically exploited to evaluate a likelihood function within a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. The feature extractor undergoes pairwise supervised training to map sensor recordings onto a low-dimensional metric space, which encapsulates the sensitivity to structural health parameters. The surrogate model maps structural health parameters to their feature representation. The procedure enables the updating of beliefs about structural health parameters, eliminating the need for computationally expensive numerical models. A preliminary offline phase involves the generation of a labeled dataset to train both the feature extractor and the surrogate model. Within a simulation-based SHM framework, training vibration responses are efficiently generated using a multi-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy to approximate sensor recordings under varying damage and operational conditions. The multi-fidelity surrogate exploits model order reduction and artificial neural networks to speed up the data generation phase while ensuring the damage-sensitivity of the approximated signals. The proposed strategy is assessed through three synthetic case studies, demonstrating high accuracy in the estimated parameters and strong computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Medium-Term Covariance Forecasting in Multi-Asset Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate covariance forecasting is central to portfolio allocation, risk management, and asset pricing, yet many existing methods struggle at medium-term horizons, where shifting market regimes and slower dynamics predominate. We propose a deep learning framework that combines three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, bidirectional long short-term memory layers, and multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Using daily data on 14 exchange-traded funds from 2017 through 2023, we find that our model reduces Euclidean and Frobenius distance metrics by up to 20\% relative to classical benchmarks (e.g., shrinkage and GARCH approaches) and remains robust across distinct market regimes. Our portfolio experiments demonstrate significant economic value through lower volatility and moderate turnover. These findings highlight the potential of advanced deep learning architectures to improve medium-term covariance forecasts, offering practical benefits for institutional investors and risk managers.</description>
