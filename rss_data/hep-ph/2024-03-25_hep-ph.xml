      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Probing sterile neutrino freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regime of dark matter (DM) freeze-in at stronger coupling interpolates between freeze-in and freeze-out. It relies on Boltzmann-suppressed dark matter production, implying that the Standard Model bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. In this work, we study this regime in the context of sterile neutrino dark matter, which can be sufficiently long-lived for a tiny sterile-active mixing. The sterile neutrino is assumed to couple to a real singlet scalar, providing for a thermal production mechanism of the former. We find that DM mass can range from GeV to tens of TeV consistently with all the constraints. The most interesting aspect of the consequent freeze-in phenomenology is that the sterile neutrino dark matter can be probed efficiently by both direct detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell constructible massive amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct tree-level amplitude for massive particles using on-shell recursion relations based on two classes of momentum shifts: an all-line transverse shift that deforms momentum by its transverse polarization vector, and a massive BCFW-type shift. We illustrate that these shifts allow us to correctly calculate four-point and five-point amplitudes in massive QED, without an ambiguity associated with the contact terms that may arise from a simple ``gluing'' of lower-point on-shell amplitudes. We discuss various aspects and applicability of the two shifts, including the large-z behavior and complexity scaling. We show that there exists a ``good'' all-line transverse shift for all possible little group configurations of the external particles, which can be extended to a broader class of theories with massive particles such as massive QCD and theories with massive spin-1 particles. The massive BCFW-type shift enjoys more simplicity, but a ``good'' shift does not exist for all the spin states due to the specific choice of spin axis.</description>

      <title>From pole parameters to line shapes and branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances are uniquely characterized by their complex pole locations and the corresponding residues. In practice, however, resonances are typically identified experimentally as structures in invariant mass distributions, with branching fractions of resonances determined as ratios of count rates. To make contact between these quantities it is necessary to connect line shapes and resonance parameters. In this work we propose such a connection and illustrate the formalism with detailed studies of the $\rho(770)$ and $f_0(500)$ resonances. Based on the line shapes inferred from the resonance parameters along these lines, expressions for partial widths and branching ratios are derived and compared to other approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Minimal decaying dark matter: from cosmological tensions to neutrino signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The invisible decay of cold dark matter into a slightly lighter dark sector particle on cosmological time-scales has been proposed as a solution to the $S_8$ tension. In this work we discuss the possible embedding of this scenario within a particle physics framework, and we investigate its phenomenology. We identify a minimal dark matter decay setup that addresses the $S_8$ tension, while avoiding the stringent constraints from indirect dark matter searches. In our scenario, the dark sector contains two singlet fermions $N_{1,2}$, quasi-degenerate in mass, and carrying lepton number so that the heaviest state ($N_2$) decays into the lightest ($N_1$) and two neutrinos via a higher-dimensional operator $N_2\to \bar N_1\nu\nu$. The conservation of lepton number, and the small phase-space available for the decay, forbids the decay channels into hadrons and strongly suppresses the decays into photons or charged leptons. We derive complementary constraints on the model parameters from neutrino detectors, freeze-in dark matter production via $\nu\nu\to N_1N_2$, collider experiments and blazar observations, and we show that the upcoming JUNO neutrino observatory could detect signals of dark matter decay for model parameters addressing the $S_8$ tension if the dark matter mass is below $\simeq 1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression from the three-loop QCD potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the suppression of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma using the three-loop QCD static potential. The potential describes the spin-averaged bottomonium spectrum below threshold with a less than 1% error. Within potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and an open quantum systems framework, we compute the evolution of the bottomonium density matrix. The values of the quarkonium transport coefficients are obtained from lattice QCD measurements of the bottomonium in-medium width and thermal mass shift; we additionally include for the first time a vacuum contribution to the dispersive coefficient ${\gamma}$. Using the three-loop potential and the values of the heavy quarkonium transport coefficients, we find that the resulting bottomonium nuclear modification factor is consistent with experimental observations, while at the same time reproducing the lattice measurements of the in-medium width.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Interactions and CFT in Topological Matter, Anomaly Sum Rules and the Faraday Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss fundamental aspects of chiral anomaly-driven interactions in conformal field theory (CFT) in four spacetime dimensions. They find application in very general contexts, from early universe plasma to topological condensed matter. We outline the key shared characteristics of these interactions, specifically addressing the case of chiral anomalies, both for vector currents and gravitons. In the case of topological materials, the gravitational chiral anomaly is generated by thermal gradients via the (Tolman-Ehrenfest) Luttinger relation. In the CFT framework, a nonlocal effective action, derived through perturbation theory, indicates that the interaction is mediated by an excitation in the form of an anomaly pole, which appears in the conformal limit of the vertex. To illustrate this, we demonstrate how conformal Ward identities (CWIs) in momentum space allow us to reconstruct the entire chiral anomaly interaction in its longitudinal and transverse sectors just by inclusion of a pole in the longitudinal sector. Both sectors are coupled in amplitudes with an intermediate chiral fermion or a bilinear Chern-Simons current with intermediate photons. In the presence of fermion mass corrections, the pole transforms into a cut, but the absorption amplitude in the axial-vector channel satisfies mass-independent sum rules related to the anomaly in any chiral interaction. The detection of an axion-like/quasiparticle in these materials may rely on a combined investigation of these sum rules, along with the measurement of the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of incident light when subjected to a chiral perturbation. This phenomenon serves as an analogue of a similar one in ordinary axion physics, in the presence of an axion-like condensate, that we rederive using axion electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Waning of the WIMP: Endgame?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) continue to be considered some of the best-motivated Dark Matter (DM) candidates. No conclusive signal, despite an extensive search program that combines, often in a complementary way, direct, indirect, and collider probes, has been however detected so far. This situation might change in the near future with the advent of even larger, multi-ton Direct Detection experiments. We provide here an updated review of the WIMP paradigm, with a focus on selected models that can be probed with upcoming facilities, all relying on the standard freeze-out paradigm for the relic density. We also discuss Collider and Indirect Searches when they provide complementary experimental information.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we have studied the most general generating function of reduction for one loop integrals with arbitrary tensor structure in numerator and arbitrary power distribution of propagators in denominator. Using IBP relations, we have established the partial differential equations for these generating functions and solved them analytically. These results provide useful guidance for applying generating function method to reductions of higher loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint to explain the experimental data of neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for all those experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path.</description>

      <title>Axion production in the $\eta\to \pi\pi a$ decay within $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axion and axion-like particle production from the $\eta\to\pi\pi a$ decay within the $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the one-loop level. The conventional $SU(3)$ chiral low energy constants are found to be able to reabsorb all the divergences from the chiral loops in the $\eta\to\pi\pi a$ decay amplitude, and hence render the amplitude independent of the renormalization scale. The unitarized $\eta\to\pi\pi a$ decay amplitudes are constructed to take into account the $\pi\pi$ final-state interactions and also properly reproduce the perturbative results from the chiral perturbation theory. Detailed analyses between the perturbative amplitudes and the unitarized ones are given in the phenomenological discussions. By taking the values of the chiral low energy constants in literature, we predict the Dalitz distributions, the spectra of the $\pi\pi$ and $a\pi$ systems, and also the branching ratios of the $\eta\to\pi\pi a$ process by varying $m_a$ from 0 to $m_\eta-2m_{\pi}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use analytic continuation to extend the gauge/gravity duality nonperturbative description of the strong force coupling into the transition, near-perturbative, regime where perturbative effects become important. By excluding the unphysical region in coupling space from the flow of singularities in the complex plane, we derive a specific relation between the scales relevant at large and short distances; this relation is uniquely fixed by requiring maximal analyticity. The unified effective coupling model gives an accurate description of the data in the nonperturbative and the near-perturbative regions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Effects of tensor spin polarization on the chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of tensor spin polarization (TSP) on the chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions are studied in Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. For chiral phase transition, the higher the polarized degree of quark-antiquark pairs under the strong magnetic field, the higher the phase transition temperature. The TSP corrects the position of the critical end point (CEP). The small impact of TSP on the phase transition temperature is found for the deconfinement phase transition. On the other hand, we divide the phase space into three ranges based on the phase diagram obtained from the PNJL model: the confinement phase with chiral symmetry broken, the deconfinement phase with restored chiral symmetry, and the confinement phase with restored chiral symmetry (quarkonic phase). It is found that TSP has only a very small effect on the anisotropic pressure in the deconfined phase with chiral symmetry restored and the quarkyonic phase, but it has a very strong effect on the anisotropic pressure in the confined phase with chiral symmetry broken. This is because TSP is closely related to chiral symmetry. The restoration of chiral symmetry means the dissociation of spin polarization condensate.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from domain wall collapses and dark matter in the SM with a complex scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study domain wall induced by spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and its gravitational wave signature in the standard model with a complex scalar in connection with dark matter physics. In a minimal setup, a linear term of the singlet field is added to the scalar potential as an explicit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking term to make the domain wall unstable. We obtain its minimal size from cosmological constraints and show that the parameter space that can be probed by current and future pulsar time array experiments requires the vacuum expectation value of the singlet field to be greater than $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ TeV, along with a singlet-like Higgs mass of $\mathcal{O}(1-100)$ TeV. However, such a region is severely restricted by the dark matter relic density, which places an upper bound on the singlet vacuum expectation value at approximately 200 TeV, and limits the dark matter mass to about half of the singlet-like Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of the modeling of Earth structure on the neutrino propagation at ultra-high-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos measured in UHE neutrino detectors is strongly dependent on the description of the propagation and absorption of the neutrinos during the passage through Earth to the detector. In particular, the attenuation of the incident neutrino flux depends on the details of the matter structure between the source and the detector. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of different descriptions for the density profile of Earth on the transmission coefficient, defined as the ratio between the flux measured in the detector and the incoming neutrino flux. We will consider five different models for the Earth's density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the NC interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented. Our results indicated that the predictions are sensitive to the model considered for the density profile, with the simplified three layer model providing a satisfactory description when compared with the PREM results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moments of Hidden-Bottom Pentaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systematically magnetic moments of hiddden-bottom pentaquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{\pm}$, $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$, and $J^P=\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ with molecular, diquark-diquark-antiquark, and diquark-triquark models. The numerical results show that magnetic moments are different within the same model according to same quantum numbers and spin-orbit couplings. The results are also different when different models are taken into account with the same angular momentum. The magnetic moments encode valuable information about inner structures. We believe that our results may be helpful for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Direct Production of Light Scalar in the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model at the Lifetime Frontier of LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A light pseudoscalar $A$ in the sufficient large $\tan\beta$ region of type-I two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) can be naturally a long-lived particle (LLP). We focus on the $H^{\pm}A$, $HA$ and $AA$ pair productions via the electroweak processes mediated by the bosons at the LHC, including $pp \rightarrow W^\pm/Z \rightarrow H^{\pm}/H A$ and $pp \rightarrow h \rightarrow AA$ at the 14 TeV LHC. The possibility of probing $A$ as a LLP at the FASER-2, FACET, MoEDAL-MAPP-2, MATHUSLA is discussed. We find that FASER-2 fails to probe any parameter space within 0.2 GeV $&lt; m_A &lt;$ 10 GeV for both processes. For 130 $&lt; m_{H\pm} = m_H &lt;$ 400 GeV, FACET, MoEDAL-MAPP-2 and MATHUSLA can probes $\tan \beta \lesssim 10^{4-6}$ for $m_A \lesssim 3$ GeV, and $\tan \beta \lesssim 10^{6-8}$ for 3 GeV $\lesssim m_A &lt;$ 10 GeV from $pp \rightarrow W^\pm/Z \rightarrow H^{\pm}/Z A$ processes. And $pp \rightarrow h \rightarrow AA$ covers similar parameter space. All processes can surpass the current limits.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Electrical Conductivity Tensor for Rotating Hadron Resonance Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the influence of the Coriolis force on the electrical conductivity of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nuclear collisions, employing the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. A rotating matter in the peripheral heavy ion collisions can be expected from the initial stage of quark matter to late-stage hadronic matter. Present work is focused on rotating hadronic matter, whose medium constituents - hadron resonances can face a non-zero Coriolis force, which can influence the hadronic flow or conductivity. We estimate this conductivity tensor by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation. In the absence of Coriolis force, an isotropic conductivity tensor for hadronic matter is expected. However, our study finds that the presence of Coriolis force can generate an anisotropic conductivity tensor with three main conductivity components - parallel, perpendicular, and Hall, similar to the effect of Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field. Our study has indicated that a noticeable anisotropy of conductivity tensor can be found within the phenomenological range of angular velocity $\Omega= 0.001-0.02$ GeV and hadronic scattering radius $a=0.2-2$ fm.</description>

      <title>Consistency of pion form factor and unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions beyond leading twist in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay among the pion's form factor, transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs) extending our light-front quark model (LFQM) computation based on the Bakamjian-Thomas construction for the two-point function[41,42] to the three-point and four-point functions. Ensuring the four-momentum conservation at the meson-quark vertex from the Bakamjian-Thomas construction, the meson mass is taken consistently as the corresponding invariant meson mass both in the matrix element and the Lorentz factor in our LFQM computation. We achieve the current-component independence in the physical observables such as the pion form factor and delve into the derivation of unpolarized TMDs and PDFs associated with the forward matrix element. We address the challenges posed by twist-4 TMDs and exhibit the fulfillment of the sum rule. Effectively, our LFQM successfully handles the light-front zero modes and offers insights for broader three-point and four-point functions and related observables.</description>

      <title>A novel quark pairing in sQGP induced by the non-Abelian feature of the interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for quark propagator and quark gluon vertex in the Nambu-Gorkov basis which is widely applied to study the color superconductivity. After considering the non-Abelian feature in the off-diagonal part of quark gluon vertex, we acquire a quark pairing gap in chiral limit above the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$. The gap persists up to $2-3\,T_c$ and vanishes at higher temperature. Such a quark pairing characterizes the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma phase as a new phase and distinct from the phase with quasi quarks and gluons. Its new features can be disclosed in the heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <title>NMSSM with correct relic density and an additional 95 GeV Higgs boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether it is possible within the NMSSM to describe simultaneously a correct dark matter relic density complying with the latest null results from the LZ experiment, an extra Higgs boson with a mass of ~95 GeV visible in the bb channel at LEP and the diphoton channel at the LHC, and the deviation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from its value within the Standard Model. We find that this is still possible for a variety of dark matter annihilation mechanisms, for singlino-like but also bino-like lightest supersymmetric particles. We show the signal rates of the extra Higgs boson and the dark matter detection rates as function of the dark matter mass and annihilation mechanism. The dark matter direct detection cross section may well fall below the neutrino floor. The masses of the lightest electroweakly interacting supersymmetric particles are typically not far above 100 GeV, but not excluded due to unconventional decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the importance of interference revival when higher order corrections are included, by presenting LO and NLO differential cross-sections and $K$-factors for three processes that are sensitive to the dimension-6 SMEFT operator $O_W$ : $Z$-plus-two-jets ($Zjj$) production through Vector Boson Fusion (VBF), leptonic diboson $WZ$ and $W\gamma$. We show how lifting the interference suppression at LO, through suitable variables and cuts, is necessary to get reliable predictions at NLO. We also show bounds on $C_W$ obtained from these observables</description>

      <title>Structure Formation in Various Dynamical Dark Energy Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of the nature of Dark Energy (DE) on structure formation, focusing on the matter power spectrum and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). By analyzing the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z = 0$ and $z = 5$, as well as the ISW effect on the scale of $\ell = 10-100$, the study provides valuable insights into the influence of DE equations of state (EoS) on structure formation. The findings reveal that dynamical DE models exhibit a stronger matter power spectrum compared to constant DE models, with the JBP model demonstrating the highest amplitude and the CPL model the weakest. Additionally, the study delves into the ISW effect, highlighting the time evolution of the ISW source term $\mathcal{F}(a)$ and its derivative $d\mathcal{F}(a)/da$, and demonstrating that models with constant DE EoS exhibit a stronger amplitude of $\mathcal{F}(a)$ overall, while dynamical models such as CPL exhibit the highest amplitude among the dynamical models, whereas JBP has the lowest. The study also explores the ISW auto-correlation power spectrum and the ISW cross-correlation power spectrum, revealing that dynamical DE models dominate over those with constant DE EoS across various surveys. Moreover, it emphasizes the potential of studying the non-linear matter power spectrum and incorporating datasets from the small scales to further elucidate the dynamical nature of dark energy. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of both the matter power spectrum and the ISW signal in discerning the nature of dark energy, paving the way for future research to explore the matter power spectrum at higher redshifts and in the non-linear regime, providing deeper insights into the dynamical nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>High-cadence monitoring of the emission properties of magnetar XTE J1810-197 with the Stockert radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [...] We present a singlepulse search method, improving on commonly used neural network classifiers thanks to the filtering of radio frequency interference based on its spectral variance and the magnetar's rotation. With this approach, we were able to lower the signal to noise ratio (S/N) detection threshold from 8 to 5. This allowed us to find over 115,000 spiky single pulses - compared to 56,000 from the neutral network approach. Here, we present the temporal variation of the overall profile and single pulses. Two distinct phases of different single pulse activity can be identified: phase 1 from December 2018 to mid-2019, with a few single pulses per hour, and phase 2 from September 2020 with hundreds of single pulses per hour (with a comparable average flux density). We find that the single pulse properties and folded profile in phase 2 exhibit a change around mid-March 2021. Before this date, the folded profile consists of a single peak and single pulses, with fluences of up to 1000 Jyms and a single-peaked width distribution at around 10 ms. After mid-March 2021, the profile consists of a two peaks and the single pulse population shows a bimodal width distribution with a second peak at 1 ms and fluences of up to 500 Jyms. We also present asymmetries in the phase-resolved single pulse width distributions beginning to appear in 2020, where the pulses arriving earlier in the rotational phase appear wider than those appearing later. This asymmetry persists despite the temporal evolution of the other single pulse and emission properties. We argue that a drift in the emission region in the magnetosphere may explain this observed behaviour. Additionally, we find that the fluence of the detected single pulses depends on the rotational phase and the highest fluence is found in the centre of the peaks in the profile. [...]</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking due to multi-angle matter-neutrino resonance in neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star merger remnants are unique sites for exploring neutrino flavor conversion in dense media. Because of the natural excess of $\bar{\nu}_e$ over $\nu_e$, the neutrino-neutrino potential can cancel the matter potential, giving rise to matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion. Under the assumption of two (anti)neutrino flavors and spatial homogeneity, we solve the neutrino quantum kinetic equations to investigate the occurrence of the matter-neutrino resonance within a multi-angle framework. We find that isotropy is broken spontaneously, regardless of the mass ordering. Relying on a hydrodynamical simulation of a binary neutron star merger remnant with a black hole of $3\ M_\odot$ and an accretion torus of $0.3\ M_\odot$, we find that complete flavor conversion caused by the matter-neutrino resonance is unlikely, although the matter and neutrino potentials cancel at various locations above the disk. Importantly, the matter-neutrino resonant flavor conversion crucially depends on the shape of the neutrino angular distributions. Our findings suggest that an accurate modeling of the neutrino angular distributions is necessary to understand flavor conversion physics in merger remnants, its implications on the disk physics and synthesis of the elements heavier than iron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gravitational particle production (GPP) of a massive, Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.</description>

Abstract: We examine the gamma-ray signal from dark matter (DM) annihilation from analogues of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Auriga cosmological simulations. For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over two orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld models, the corresponding emission decreases by up to nearly an order of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr, finding that the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.</description>

      <title>Galilean relativity and wave-particle duality imply the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>The Non-triviality of Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity and the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator $\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$ has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in string theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalies and Dynamics in Strongly-Coupled Gauge Theories, New Criteria for Different Phases, and a Lesson from Supersymmetric Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in our understanding of the dynamics of strongly-coupled chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories in four dimensions, problems which are potentially important in our quest to go beyond the standard $SU(3)_{QCD} \times (SU(2) \times U(1))_{GWS}$ model of the fundamental interactions. The generalized symmetries and associated new 't Hooft anomaly-matching constraints allow us to exclude, in a wide class of chiral gauge theories, confining vacuum with full flavor symmetries supported by a set of color-singlet massless composite fermions. The color-flavor-locked dynamical Higgs phase, dynamical Abelianization or more general symmetry breaking phase, appear as plausible IR dynamics, depending on the massless matter fermions present. We revisit and discuss critically several well-known confinement criteria in the literature, for both chiral and vectorlike gauge theories, and propose tentative, new criteria for discriminating different phases. Finally, we review an idea which might sound rather surprising at first, but is indeed realized in some softly-broken supersymmetric theories, that confinement in QCD is a small deformation (in the IR end of the renormalization-group flow) of a strongly-coupled, nonlocal, nonAbelian conformal fixed point.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lagrangian Cubic Interaction Vertices For Irreducible Higher Spin Fields in Minkowski Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harboring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, choked jets have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic signatures is crucial. A choked-jet source is expected harboring in core-collapse supernovae with extended hydrogen envelopes, leading to the release of ultraviolet and optical emission for a few days. The ultraviolet band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future mission satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the chocked source visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic and photohadronic interactions in choked jets, we also investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (as IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with electromagnetic signals coming from shock breakout events. By considering fiducial parameters of the source population and instruments performances, we estimate the maximum redshift up to which ULTRASAT and ZTF are able to detect ultraviolet and optical signals from these explosions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss coordinated multi-messenger observations among those instruments and high-energy neutrino telescopes. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources enlarging the sample of observed Type II supernovae by around 60%. For optimized multi-messenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at the shock breakout occurrence (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a subsequent follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after.</description>

      <title>Generation of $\gamma$-photons and pairs with transverse orbital angular momentum via spatiotemporal optical vortex pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the generation of well-collimated $\gamma$-photons and pairs with extrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) through the head-on collision of an intense spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulse carrying intrinsic TOAM with a high-energy electron beam. It is found that the TOAM of STOV pulse remains almost unchanged, and the TOAM is conserved in the center-of-mass frame (CMF). Moreover, there exhibits duality for particles TOAM in the CMF and laboratory frame (LF) when the initial location of high-energy electron beam is different. Furthermore, the TOAM of $\gamma$-photons in the CMF increases while that of positrons decreases as the topological charge of STOV pulse increases, whereas in the LF, the TOAM of both $\gamma$-photons and positrons decreases. And the result under the same pulse intensity is better than that under the same pulse energy. The increase in the initial energy of high-energy electrons leads to an enhancement of the TOAM for both $\gamma$-photons and positrons in both frames. $\gamma$-photons and electrons/positrons with TOAM as a new degree of freedom maybe have an extensive applications in optical communication, astrophysics and nanomaterials and so on.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, encompassing light-flavor, strange-flavor, and light nuclei produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). By conducting a thermal analysis of hadron yields with and without the inclusion of light nuclei yields, we observe a discernible decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ when light nuclei yields are considered. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage of the system evolution. Furthermore, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ associated with strange-flavor particles is found to be approximately $20-30$ MeV higher than that for light-flavor particles and light nuclei, hinting at the existence of multiple freeze-out hyper-surfaces for different hadron types in heavy-ion collisions. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and $\mu_B$ for four distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions. These formulas allow for the selection of appropriate parameters tailored to specific studies, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the freeze-out process.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

      <description>arXiv:2403.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $U(1)$ gauge theory on $M^4\times T^4$ with background magnetic fluxes. We show that a theory including arbitrary fluxes can always be studied in a theory involving only diagonal fluxes by appropriate coordinate transformations. It is found that the number of independent magnetic fluxes is equal to the rank of the classical value of the field strength matrix, ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. The number of massless zero modes induced from extra components of higher-dimensional gauge field (Wilson-line scalar field), is also determined by ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. We explicitly confirm that the quantum corrections due to the matter fermion to the squared mass of Wilson-line scalar field cancel out at one-loop level. For this purpose, we derive the fermion mass spectrum on $M^4\times T^4$ with arbitrary fluxes. By taking the flux diagonal basis, creation and annihilation operators for Kaluza-Klein quantum numbers are defined appropriately. Our results are easily generalized to the case of $M^4\times T^{2n}~(n\geq3)$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fluctuations and topological susceptibility in chiral magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetohydrodynamics is devoted to understanding the late-time and long-distance behavior of a system with an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly at finite temperatures. The non-conservation of the axial charge is determined by the topological density $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$; in a classical hydrodynamic description this decay rate can be suppressed by tuning the background magnetic field to zero. However it is in principle possible for thermal fluctuations of $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$ to result in a non-conservation of the charge even at vanishing $B$-field; this would invalidate the classical hydrodynamic effective theory. We investigate this by computing the real-time susceptibility of the topological density at one-loop level in magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations, relating its low-frequency limit to the decay rate of the axial charge. We find that the frequency-dependence of this susceptibility is sufficiently soft as to leave the axial decay rate unaffected, validating the classical hydrodynamic description. We show that the susceptibility contains non-analytic frequency-dependence which is universally determined by hydrodynamic data. We comment briefly on possible connections to the recent formulation of the ABJ anomaly in terms of non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

Abstract: Dai and Pennington have performed a comprehensive analysis of essentially all pion and kaon pair production data from two-photon collisions below 1.5 GeV, including all high statistics results from Belle, as well as the older data from Mark II at SLAC, CELLO at DESY, and Crystal Ball at SLAC. Imposing the basic constraints required by analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry and making use of Low's low-energy theorem for QED, they were able to extract the final-state, strong-interaction scattering amplitudes for the intermediate $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ and $\pi \pi \to K \overline{K}$ reactions in a model-independent fashion. In addition, they provided good fits to the respective $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections that are known in the low-energy sector in the restricted angular range, $| \cos \theta | &lt; 0.6 - 0.8$. Using the parameters obtained in this fashion, these authors constructed the $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections integrated over the full angular range. In the present work, we use a version of chiral perturbation theory developed by Oller and Oset to evaluate the final-state, strong-interaction amplitudes theoretically, and we compare our low-energy QCD-based results with the amplitudes extracted by Dai and Pennington. We also calculate the $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections (integrated over the full angular range) and compare them with those obtained by Dai and Pennington. These calculations give a more detailed insight into the fit of chiral perturbation theory, not just to the measured $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections, as is usually presented, but rather to a higher level of detail through the available analysis of the experimental data for the underlying final-state, strong-interaction, meson-meson scattering amplitudes $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ and $\pi \pi \to K \overline{K}$ themselves. The fits appear to be sensible.</description>

      <title>Boosted displaced decay of right-handed neutrinos at CMS, ATLAS and MATHUSLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boosted displaced signatures in the Type-I seesaw mechanism associated with the $B-L$ gauge symmetry. Such events arise from decays of right-handed neutrinos depending on their Yukawa couplings and masses. Considering two scenarios: (a) three degenerate right-handed neutrinos whose Yukawa couplings are reconstructed from the observed neutrino masses and mixing; (b) only one right-handed neutrino which decouples from the observed neutrino mass generation and thus its coupling can be arbitrarily small, a detailed PYTHIA based simulation is performed to determine the parameter regions of the $B-L$ gauge boson mass, the neutrino Yukawa couplings, and the right-handed neutrino mass sensitive to CMS, ATLAS, proposed FCC-hh detector and MATHUSLA at the centre of mass energies of 14, 27 and 100 TeV via displaced signatures. We also show in detail how the boost effect enhances the displaced decay lengths, especially for the longitudinal ones, and hinders the probe of Majorana nature of neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices open a new avenue to detect dark matter (DM). The threshold of these devices is set by the Cooper pair binding energy, and is therefore so low that they can detect DM as light as about an MeV incoming from the Galactic halo, as well as the low-velocity thermalized DM component potentially present in the Earth. Using existing power measurements with these new devices, as well as power measurements with SuperCDMS-CPD, we set new constraints on the spin-independent DM scattering cross section for DM masses from about 10 MeV to 10 GeV. We outline future directions to improve sensitivity to both halo DM and a thermalized DM population in the Earth using power deposition in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Prospects for exotic $h\rightarrow 4 \tau$ decays in single and di-Higgs boson production at the LHC and future hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prospects for observing exotic decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson $h$ into light beyond the Standard Model scalars $a$ with mass $m_{a} \lesssim m_{h}/2$ in the single Higgs and Higgs pair production channels at the high luminosity run of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Discovery prospects for single Higgs production in the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion modes with the Higgs boson decaying via the exotic mode $h \to aa \to 4\tau$ are analyzed at the HL-LHC. The projected sensitivity for exotic Higgs decays in the non-resonant Higgs pair production channel $pp \to hh \to (h \to b\bar{b})(h \to aa \to 4\tau) \to 2b4\tau$ at the HL-LHC and a future $\sqrt{s}=100~$TeV hadron collider (FCC-hh) are also estimated. Furthermore, we study HL-LHC's potential reach for the Higgs-strahlung process in the $2b4\tau$ channel, taking into account the contamination from non-resonant Higgs pair production. Finally, the potential reach for resonant Higgs pair production in the $2b4\tau$ channel %$pp \to H \to (h \to b\bar{b})(h \to aa \to 4\tau)$ at the HL-LHC is also explored for several choices of $\{m_{H},m_{a}\}$. Our studies suggest that significant improvements over existing bounds are achievable in several production channels, motivating new dedicated searches for $h \rightarrow aa \rightarrow 4 \tau$ at the HL-LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moments of Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of neutrino magnetic moments on astrophysical neutrinos, in particular supernova neutrinos and ultra-high energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources. We show that magnetic moment-induced conversion of left-handed neutrinos into unobservable right-handed singlet states can substantially change the flux and flavour composition of these neutrinos at Earth. Notably, neutrinos from a supernova's neutronisation burst, whose flux can be predicted with O(10%) accuracy, offer a discovery reach to neutrino magnetic moments $\sim \text{few} \times 10^{-13} \mu_B$, up to one order of magnitude below current limits. For high-energy neutrinos from distant sources, for which no robust flux prediction exists, we show how the flavour composition at Earth can be used as a handle to establish the presence of non-negligible magnetic moments, potentially down to $\text{few} \times 10^{-17} \mu_B$ if the measurement can be performed on neutrinos from a single source. In both cases, the sensitivity strongly depends on the galactic resp. intergalactic magnetic field profiles along the line of sight. Therefore, while a discovery is possible down to very small values of the magnetic moment, the absence of a discovery does not imply an equally strong limit. We also comment on the dependence of our results on the right-handed neutrino mass, paying special attention to the transition from coherent deflection by a classical magnetic field to incoherent scattering on individual scattering targets. Finally, we show that a measurement of Standard Model Dirac neutrino magnetic moments, of order $10^{-19} \mu_B$, could be possible under rather optimistic, but not completely outrageous, assumptions using flavour ratios of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological study of a gauged ${L_\mu -L_\tau}$ model with a scalar leptoquark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $Z'$ gauge boson with sub-GeV mass has acquired a significant interest in phenomenology, particularly in view of the muon $g-2$ anomaly and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering. The latter is challenged by the nuclear recoil energy of a few tens of keV but has been observed by the COHERENT experiment. To further reconcile the observed excesses in $R(D^{(*)})$ from semileptonic charmful $B$ decays and in the $W$ boson mass, we investigate a model with a gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry and a scalar leptoquark. In contrast to the mechanism that involves kinetic mixing between the gauge bosons of $U(1)_{\rm em}$ and $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, we adopt a dynamical symmetry breaking of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ by incorporating an additional Higgs doublet. Through mixing with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$-charged Higgs doublet, new Higgs decay channels $h\to Z_1 Z_1/Z_1 Z_2$ occur at percent-level branching ratios, which could be accessible at the LHC. The $W$-mass anomaly observed by CDF II can be potentially resolved through the enhancement in the oblique parameter $T$. Due to the flavored gauge symmetry, the introduced scalar leptoquark $S^{\frac{1}{3}}=(\bar{3},1,2/3)$ exhibits a unique coupling to the $\tau$-lepton, offering an explanation for the excesses observed in $R(D^{(*)})$. Moreover, $\tau \to \mu (Z_1\to ) e^- e^+$ via the resonant light gauge boson decay can reach the sensitivity of Belle II at an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the coupling between fermion spin and background electromagnetic fields using form factors. We show that the vacuum form factors at tree level reproduce the spin polarization effects found in chiral kinetic theory. The vacuum form factors corresponding to spin couplings to perpendicular electric field, parallel and perpendicular magnetic field are degenerate. The degeneracy is expected to be lifted in medium. As an example, we calculate the in-medium QCD radiative correction to the form factors at one-loop order, where we find partial lift of the degeneracy: the spin couplings to parallel and perpendicular magnetic field are different, but the spin couplings to perpendicular electric and parallel magnetic field remain the same.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2305.14140 [hep-ph] the authors analyze the radiative leptonic decay $\ell^- \to \nu_\ell \, \overline{\nu}_{\ell'} \, \ell^{\prime -} \, \gamma$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos. They utilize the back-to-back kinematics for this purpose, a special kinematic configuration which we first proposed in our paper arXiv:2106.11785 [hep-ph]. Here we point out how and why their analysis of the back-to-back configuration is incorrect. This makes their conclusion and comments invalid and untenable.</description>

Abstract: We present the results from our investigation of angular correlations between baryon pairs in the PYTHIA8 event generator. We show how colour reconnection models and hadronization mechanisms influence such angular correlations and in particular address the effect of gluons on the baryon production mechanism in the Lund string fragmentation model. We conclude by discussing the new theoretical ideas in comparison with the ALICE pp collision results for the baryon angular correlations. We propose a hypothesis for suppressing baryons produced in gluon jets and show how that may influence the angular correlations.</description>

      <title>Testing Meson Portal Dark Sector Solutions to the MiniBooNE Anomaly at CCM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solution to the MiniBooNE excess invoking rare three-body decays of the charged pions and kaons to new states in the MeV mass scale was recently proposed as a dark-sector explanation. This class of solution illuminates the fact that, while the charged pions were focused in the target-mode run, their decay products were isotropically suppressed in the beam-dump-mode run in which no excess was observed. This suggests a new physics solution correlated to the mesonic sector. We investigate an extended set of phenomenological models that can explain the MiniBooNE excess as a dark sector solution, utilizing long-lived particles that might be produced in the three-body decays of the charged mesons and the two-body anomalous decays of the neutral mesons. Over a broad set of interactions with the long-lived particles, we show that these scenarios can be compatible with constraints from LSND, KARMEN, and MicroBooNE, and evaluate the sensitivity of the ongoing and future data taken by the Coherent CAPTAIN Mills experiment (CCM) to a potential discovery in this parameter space.</description>

Abstract: The PYTHIA8/ANGANTYR model for heavy ion collisions was recently updated with a mechanism for \textit{global colour reconnection}. The colour reconnection model used is QCD colour algebra inspired and enhances baryon production due to the formation of string junctions. In this paper, we present updates to the junction formation and string fragmentation mechanisms, connected to heavy quark fragmentation. This allows for the simulation of heavy quark fragmentation, using junction formation, in heavy ion collisions. The framework is validated for proton collisions, and we show results for charm baryon production in proton-lead collisions.</description>

      <title>Updates on the determination of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$, $R(D^{*})$ and $\vert V_{ub} \vert/\vert V_{cb} \vert$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated determination of the values of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$, $R(D^*)$ and $\vert V_{ub} \vert/\vert V_{cb} \vert$ based on the new data on semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays by the Belle and Belle-II Collaborations and on the recent theoretical progress in the calculation of the form factors relevant for semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ and $B_s \to K \ell \nu_\ell$ decays. In particular we present results derived by applying either the Dispersive Matrix (DM) method of Refs. [1-6] or the more standard Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) [7] approach to the most recent values of the form factors determined in lattice QCD. Using all the available lattice results for the form factors from the DM method we get the theoretical value $R^{\rm th}(D^*) = 0.262 \pm 0.009$ and we extract from a bin-per-bin analysis of the experimental data the value $\vert V_{cb} \vert = (39.92 \pm 0.64) \cdot10^{-3}$. Our result for $R(D^*)$ is consistent with the latest experimental world average $R^{\rm exp}(D^*) = 0.284 \pm 0.012$ [8]} at the $\simeq 1.5\,\sigma$ level. Our value for $\vert V_{cb} \vert$ is compatible with the latest inclusive determinations $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} = (41.97 \pm 0.48) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [9] and $\vert V_{cb} \vert^{\rm incl} = (41.69\pm 0.63) \cdot 10^{-3}$ [10] within $\simeq 2.6$ and $\simeq 2.0$ standard deviations, respectively. From a reappraisal of the calculations of $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert$, we also obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.087\pm 0.009$ in good agreement with the result $\vert V_{ub} \vert / \vert V_{cb} \vert = 0.0844\pm 0.0056$ from the latest FLAG review [11].</description>

      <title>Interplay of inert doublet and vector-like lepton triplet with displaced vertices at the LHC/FCC and MATHUSLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction between the inert Higgs doublet (IDM) dark matter and a vector-like $SU(2)$ triplet lepton (VLL), both of which are $Z_2$-odd. The vector current of the VLL with the $Z$-boson rules out a fermionic or two-component dark matter scenario. However, a compressed mass spectrum and a sufficiently small Yukawa coupling allows co-annihilation and late decay of the VLL into the IDM sector, affecting the relic density of the pseudoscalar dark matter. The same two factors enable displaced decay of the VLL states, providing novel signatures involving hadronically quiet displaced multi-lepton final states. Such signatures to probe the model are studied at the 14 and 27 TeV LHC, as well as the 100 TeV FCC-hh. In addition to being detectable at the CMS/ATLAS experiments, if the new particles have sub-100 GeV masses, signals can also be seen at the proposed MATHUSLA detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the four-top quark operator contributions to Higgs production via gluon fusion in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. The four-top operators enter for the first time via two-loop diagrams. Due to their chiral structure they contain $\gamma_5$, so special care needs to be taken when using dimensional regularisation for the loop integrals. We use two different schemes for the continuation of $\gamma_5$ to $D$ space-time dimensions in our calculations and present a mapping for the parameters in the two schemes. This generically leads to an interplay of different operators, such as four-top operators, chromomagnetic operators or Yukawa-type operators at the loop level. We validate our results by examples of matching onto UV models.</description>

Abstract: Triggered by the observation of four top-quark production at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration we report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the Standard Model process $pp \to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ in the $4\ell$ top-quark decay channel. We take into account higher-order QCD effects in both the production and decays of the four top quarks. The latter effects are treated in the narrow width approximation, which preserves top-quark spin correlations throughout the calculation. We present results for two selected renormalisation and factorisation scale settings and three different PDF sets. Furthermore, we study the main theoretical uncertainties that are associated with the neglected higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion and with the parameterisation of the PDF sets. The results at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level are shown for the LHC Run III center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our findings are particularly relevant for precise measurements of the four top-quark fiducial cross sections and for the modelling of top-quark decays at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Generalized Parton Distributions Through Lorentz Symmetry and Partial DGLAP Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relying on the polynomiality property of generalized parton distributions, which roots on Lorentz covariance, we prove that it is enough to know them at vanishing- and low-skewness within the DGLAP region to obtain a unique extension to their entire support up to a D-term. We put this idea in practice using two methods: Reconstruction using artificial neural networks and finite-elements methods. We benchmark our results against standard models for generalized parton distributions. In agreement with the formal expectation, we obtain a very accurate reconstructions for a maximal value of the skewness as low as 20% of the longitudinal momentum fraction. This result might be relevant for reconstruction of generalized parton distribution from experimental and lattice QCD data, where computations are for now, restricted in skewness.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb interaction in elastic pion-proton scattering from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential cross sections of the elastic pion-proton scattering are investigated at very small momentum transfer in a holographic QCD model, considering both the strong and Coulomb interaction in the Regge regime. The strong interaction is described by the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, and the Coulomb interaction is characterized by the one photon exchange. The two interactions are linked through an interference term and we only need to determine a single adjustable parameter involved in this term. As to the parameters for the strong interaction, we can utilize the values determined in the previous studies. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the experimental data. We explicitly show the momentum transfer dependence for the interference effect. The energy dependence of the contribution ratios for each component is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>The low-mass enhancement of kaon pairs in $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0}K^+\bar{K}^0$ and $B^0\to D^{(*)-}K^+\bar{K}^0$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, the Belle~II collaboration presented a measurement for the decays $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0} K^+\bar{K}^0$ and $B^0\to D^{(*)-}K^+\bar{K}^0$, the bulk of observed $m(K^+ K_S^0)$ distributions showing low-mass structures in all four channels. In this work, we study the contributions of $\rho(770,1450)^+$, $a_2(1320)^+$ and $a_0(980,1450)^+$ resonances to these decay processes. The intermediate states $\rho(770,1450)^+$ are found to dominate the low-mass distribution of kaon pairs roughly contributing to half of the total branching fraction in each of the four decay channels. The contribution of the tensor $a_2(1320)^+$ meson is found to be negligible. Near the threshold of the kaon pair, the state $a_0(980)^+$ turns out to be much less important than expected, not being able to account for the enhancement of events in that energy region observed in the $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0} K^+\bar{K}^0$ decays. Further studies both from the theoretical and experimental sides are needed to elucidate the role of the non-resonant contributions governing the formation of $K^+\bar{K}^0$ pairs near their threshold in these decay processes.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>

      <title>Novel imprint of a dark photon from the 3-3-1-1 model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a dark photon that arises from the UV model based upon $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X \otimes U(1)_G$ (3-3-1-1) gauge symmetry, where the last three factors enlarge the electroweak symmetry encompassing electric charge $Q=T_3 - 1/ \sqrt{3}T_8 +X$ and dark charge $D = -2/\sqrt{3} T_8 +G$. It is well-established that this model addresses the questions of family number, neutrino mass, and dark matter. It is shown in this work that if the 3-3-1-1 breaking scale is much bigger than the dark charge breaking scale, the relevant dark gauge boson $Z'$ is uniquely imprinted at TeV, avoiding dangerous FCNC processes, obeying precision electroweak measurements, as well as contributing to collider phenomena, even if no kinetic mixing is presented. The dark matter observables are perhaps governed by the dark charge breaking Higgs field instead of the dark photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unravel the composition of the isoscalar $DN$, $D^*N$, $D_1N$, and $D_2^*N$ molecular pentaquarks, we carry out a systematic investigation of their M1 radiative decays and magnetic moment properties. Using the constituent quark model and taking into account the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect, our analysis yields numerical results indicating that the M1 radiative decays and the magnetic moment properties of these molecular pentaquarks provide some insights into their inner structures. These results can serve as crucial clues for distinguishing their spin-parity quantum numbers and configurations in experimental studies. In addition, we highlight the importance of the electromagnetic properties as key observables for elucidating the inner structures of the observed $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$. We hope that these discoveries will inspire our experimental colleagues to further explore the family of the single-charm molecular pentaquarks and to investigate the inner structures of the $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$ in future studies.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis force on the shear viscosity of quark matter: A nonrelativistic description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity becomes anisotropic in a rotating medium. It is discovered here that for rotating thermalized quantum systems such as those created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the coeffficient of shear viscosity breaks up into five independent components. Similar phenomena were also discovered for quark-gluon plasma in the presence of the magnetic field. Like the Lorentz force at a finite magnetic field, the Coriolis force also creates anisotropic viscosity at nonzero rotation. As a first approach, for simplicity, the calculations are done in the nonrelativistic prescription, with a future proposal to extend it toward a relativistic description. Introducing the Coriolis force term in relaxation time approximated Boltzmann transport equation, we have found different effective relaxation times along the parallel, perpendicular, and Hall directions in terms of actual relaxation time and rotating time period. Comparing the present formalism with the finite magnetic field picture, we have shown the equivalence of roles between the rotating and cyclotron time periods, where the rotating time period is inverse of twice the angular velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory framework to study the isospin-symmetry breaking correction $\delta_\text{C}$ in superallowed nuclear beta decays, crucial for the precise determination of $|V_{ud}|$. Based on a general assumptions of the isovector dominance in ISB interactions, we construct a set of functions $F_{T_z}$ which involve nuclear matrix elements of isovector monopole operators and the nuclear Green's function. Via the functions $F_{T_z}$, a connection of $\delta_\text{C}$ to measurable electroweak nuclear radii is established, providing an experimental gauge of the theory accuracy of $\delta_\text{C}$. We outline a strategy to perform ab-initio calculations of $F_{T_z}$ based on the Lanczos algorithm, and discuss its similarity with other nuclear-structure-dependent inputs in nuclear beta decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Thermal phonon fluctuations and stability of the magnetic dual chiral density wave phase in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability against thermal phonon fluctuations of the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase, an inhomogeneous phase arising in cold dense QCD in a magnetic field. Following a recent study that demonstrated the absence of the Landau-Peierls (LP) instability from this phase, we calculate the (threshold) temperature at which the phonon fluctuations wash out the long-range order over a range of magnetic fields and densities relevant to astrophysical applications. Using a high-order Ginzburg-Landau expansion, we find that the threshold temperature is very near the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{18}$ G, and still a sizable fraction of the critical temperature for fields of order $10^{17}$ G. Therefore, at sufficiently large magnetic fields, the long-range order of the MDCDW phase is preserved over most of the parameter space where it is energetically favored; at smaller magnetic fields, the long-range order is still preserved over a considerable region of parameter space relevant to compact stars. We provide general symmetry arguments to explain why a magnetic field alone is not enough to eliminate the LP instability that characterizes single-modulated phases in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent transition separating confinement and Higgs phases in lattice SU(2) gauge theory with a scalar field in the fundamental representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13430v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the preceding studies, the lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with a single scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group has a single confinement-Higgs phase where confinement and Higgs regions are subregions of an analytically continued single phase and there are no thermodynamic phase transitions, which is a well-known consequence of the Osterwalder-Seiler-Fradkin-Shenker theorem. In this paper, we show that we can define new types of gauge-invariant operators by combining the original fundamental scalar field and the so-called color-direction field which is obtained by change of field variables based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi. By performing the numerical simulations on the lattice without any gauge fixing, we reproduce the conventional thermodynamic transition line in the weak gauge coupling, and moreover we find a new transition line detected by the new gauge-invariant operators which separates the confinement-Higgs phase into two parts, confinement phase and the Higgs phase, in the strong gauge coupling. All results are obtained in the gauge-independent way, since no gauge fixing has been imposed in the numerical simulations. Moreover, we discuss a physical interpretation for the new transition from the viewpoint of the realization of a global symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated and actively searched for new particles that would mix with the active neutrinos. We study their phenomenology when they are produced in the evaporation of early Universe black holes, a novel production mechanism that differs from all others and does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting hotter sterile neutrinos have a distinct spectrum and could be warm dark matter in the 0.3 MeV to 0.3 TeV mass range, distinct from the typical keV range. The possible coincidence of X-rays and gravitational waves is a unique novel signature of our scenario.</description>

      <title>The Basso-Dixon Formula and Calabi-Yau Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the family of Calabi-Yau varieties attached to four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. We find that the Picard-Fuchs operators for fishnet integrals are exterior powers of the Picard-Fuchs operators for ladder integrals. This implies that the periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties for fishnet integrals can be written as determinants of periods for ladder integrals. The representation theory of the geometric monodromy group plays an important role in this context. We then show how the determinant form of the periods immediately leads to the well-known Basso-Dixon formula for four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. Notably, the relation to Calabi-Yau geometry implies that the volume is also expressible via a determinant formula of Basso-Dixon type. Finally, we show how the fishnet integrals can be written in terms of iterated integrals naturally attached to the Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>FiniteFieldSolve: Exactly Solving Large Linear Systems in High-Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large linear systems play an important role in high-energy theory, appearing in amplitude bootstraps and during integral reduction. This paper introduces FiniteFieldSolve, a general-purpose toolkit for exactly solving large linear systems over the rationals. The solver interfaces directly with Mathematica, is straightforward to install, and seamlessly replaces Mathematica's native solvers. In testing, FiniteFieldSolve is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than Mathematica and uses an order of magnitude less memory. The package also compares favorably against other public solvers in FiniteFieldSolve's intended use cases. As the name of the package suggests, solutions are obtained via well-known finite field methods. These methods suffer from introducing an inordinate number of modulo (or integer division) operations with respect to different primes. By automatically recompiling itself for each prime, FiniteFieldSolve converts the division operations into much faster combinations of instructions, dramatically improving performance. The technique of compiling the prime can be applied to any finite field solver, where the time savings will be solver dependent. The operation of the package is illustrated through a detailed example of an amplitude bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <title>Frame transformation and stable-causal hydrodynamic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame' transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new `non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of `integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>A proposal to improve the accuracy of cosmological observables and address the Hubble tension problem</title>

Abstract: (abridged)Cosmological observational programs often compare their data not only with $\Lambda$CDM, but also with extensions applying dynamical models of dark energy (DDE), with a time-dependent equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$. We found a degeneracy in the customary computational procedure for the expansion history, once DDE models are applied. This degeneracy provides an infinite number of cosmological models reproducing the Planck-measured CMB spectrum. Moreover, this degeneracy biases the comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with DDE extensions. We present a complementary computational approach, which breaks this degeneracy: the ``fixed early densities (EDs) approach'' evolves cosmological models from the early Universe to the present, in contrast to the customary ``fixed $H_0$ approach'' which evolves cosmological models in reverse order. We find the EDs are accurately approximated by the $\Lambda$CDM model. We implement a refined procedure, appyling both approaches, in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on representative DDE models using the CPL parametrization. Our results reveal that the CPL model $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find that combining both approaches, while requesting to yield consistent results and being in agreement with observations across cosmic time, can serve as a kind of consistency check for cosmological models. Moreover, our proposed consistency check applied within current data analysis methods will increase the accuracy of inferred cosmological parameters significantly, in particular for $\Lambda$CDM extensions. We find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of cosmological models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates and a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, by ongoing and future observational programs.</description>

      <title>A proposed PKU-Muon experiment for muon tomography and dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over `exotic' dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism, and sensitivity on dark matter and muon scattering cross section can reach as low as microbarn level.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a interacting pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium using the kinetic theory. The collision term of the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in presence of background magnetic field is solved using the relaxation time approximation. The medium modified relaxation time is obtained from the corresponding in-medium $\pi\pi\rightarrow \pi\pi$ scattering cross-section calculated using the thermo-magnetic $\rho$ propagator. It is observed that the average relaxation time shows a $1/T^4$ variation with temperature for a fixed value of magnetic field. The relaxation time shows a mild oscillatory variation with respect to the magnetic field. It is also observed that the medium dependent scattering cross-section causes a considerable amount of influence on the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity compared to its vacuum counterpart.</description>
