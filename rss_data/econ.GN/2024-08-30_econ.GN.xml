      <title>The Green Peace Dividend: the Effects of Militarization on Emissions and the Green Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that military buildups lead to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and can disrupt the green transition. Identifying military spending shocks, I use local projections to show that a percentage point rise in the military spending share leads to a 1-1.5% rise in total emissions, as well as a 1% rise in emission intensity. Using a dynamic production network model calibrated for the US, I find that a permanent shock of the same size would increase total emissions by between 0.36% and 1.81%, and emission intensity by between 0.22% and 1.5%. The model indicates that fossil fuel and energy-intensive firms experience a considerable expansion in response to such a shock, which could create political obstacles for the green transition. Similarly, investment in renewables and green R&amp;D could be crowded out by defence spending, further hindering the energy transition. Policymakers can use carbon prices or green subsidies to counteract these effects, the latter likely being more efficient due to political and social constraints.</description>

      <title>The Turing Valley: How AI Capabilities Shape Labor Income</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) benefit workers? We study how AI capabilities influence labor income in a competitive economy where production requires multidimensional knowledge, and firms organize production by matching humans and AI-powered machines in hierarchies designed to use knowledge efficiently. We show that advancements in AI in dimensions where machines underperform humans decrease total labor income, while advancements in dimensions where machines outperform humans increase it. Hence, if AI initially underperforms humans in all dimensions and improves gradually, total labor income initially declines before rising. We also characterize the AI that maximizes labor income. When humans are sufficiently weak in all knowledge dimensions, labor income is maximized when AI is as good as possible in all dimensions. Otherwise, labor income is maximized when AI simultaneously performs as poorly as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively strong and as well as possible in the dimensions where humans are relatively weak. Our results suggest that choosing the direction of AI development can create significant divisions between the interests of labor and capital.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Optimizing and Learning Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key in real-life Nash equilibrium applications is to calibrate players' cost functions. To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we proposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using neural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the availability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we need the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first learn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural networks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks; (b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the equilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn Nash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified Backpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>STraM: A strategic network design model for national freight transport decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: National freight transport models are valuable tools for assessing the impact of various policies and investments on achieving decarbonization targets under different future scenarios. However, these models struggle to address several critical elements necessary for strategic planning, such as the development and adoption of new fuel technologies over time, inertia in transport fleets, and uncertainty surrounding future transport costs. In this paper, we develop a strategic network design model, named STraM, that explicitly incorporates these key factors. STraM provides a network design plan that includes infrastructure investments and fuel technology decisions, aiming to achieve cost-effective decarbonization of the freight transport system. The model's output can be used as input for higher-resolution national freight transport models to yield results with greater operational detail. We demonstrate the application of STraM through a case study of Norway, offering valuable insights into the strategic planning of sustainable freight transport.</description>

      <title>Rankings-Dependent Preferences: A Real Goods Matching Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether preferences for objects received via a matching mechanism are influenced by how highly agents rank them in their reported rank order list. We hypothesize that all else equal, agents receive greater utility for the same object when they rank it higher. The addition of rankings-dependent utility implies that it may not be a dominant strategy to submit truthful preferences to a strategyproof mechanism, and that non-strategyproof mechanisms that give more agents objects they \emph{report} as higher ranked may increase market welfare. We test these hypotheses with a matching experiment in a strategyproof mechanism, the random serial dictatorship, and a non-strategyproof mechanism, the Boston mechanism. A novel feature of our experimental design is that the objects allocated in the matching markets are real goods, which allows us to directly measure rankings-dependence by eliciting values for goods both inside and outside of the mechanism. The experimental results are mixed, with stronger evidence for rankings-dependence in the RSD treatment than the Boston treatment. We find no differences between the two mechanisms for the rates of truth-telling and the final welfare.</description>

      <title>Super-efficiency of Listed Banks in China and Determinants Analysis (2006-2021)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs the annual unbalanced panel data of 42 listed banks in China from 2006 to 2021, adopts the non-radial and non-oriented super-efficiency Data envelopment analysis (Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA) model considering NPL as undesired output. Our results show that the profitability super-efficiency of State-owned banks and Rural/City Commercial Banks is better than that of Joint-stock Banks. In terms of intermediary efficiency(deposit and loan), state-owned banks have advantage on other two type of banks. The determinants analysis shows that all type of banks significantly benefits from the decrease of ownership concentration which support reformation and IPO. Regional commercial banks significantly benefit from the decrease of customer concentration and the increase of reserves. On the other hand, State-owned banks should increase its loan to deposit ratio while joint-stock banks should do the opposite.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Market Risks on New Pension System and Government Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how market risks impact the sustainability and performance of the New Pension System (NPS). NPS relies on defined contributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the employee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to sustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the corpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving them financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market risks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this, we quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to model their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being insufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from guaranteeing the pension.</description>
