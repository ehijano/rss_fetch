      <title>FinAI Data Assistant: LLM-based Financial Database Query Processing with the OpenAI Function Calling API</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs) with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&amp;P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Retrieval for the LinkedIn Feed using Causal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests), where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline, including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding, facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high throughput retrieval in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Integration and Discrepancy Resolution of Contextualized Knowledge for Personalized Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has revealed promising potential through their capacity to extract world knowledge for enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, current methodologies that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and personalized adaptation.</description>

      <title>Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</description>

      <title>Ensembling Multiple Hallucination Detectors Trained on VLLM Internal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top entries on the final leaderboard.

      <title>GemiRec: Interest Quantization and Generation for Multi-Interest Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations: the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then, we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c) Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its practical value in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</description>

      <title>Causality Enhancement for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical value in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Dataset Pruning in RecSys and ML: Best Practice or Mal-Practice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline evaluations in recommender system research depend heavily on datasets, many of which are pruned, such as the widely used MovieLens collections. This thesis examines the impact of data pruning - specifically, removing users with fewer than a specified number of interactions - on both dataset characteristics and algorithm performance. Five benchmark datasets were analysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5, 10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional characteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms. To further assess if pruned datasets lead to artificially inflated performance results, we also evaluated models trained on the pruned train sets but tested on unpruned data. Results show that commonly applied core pruning can be highly selective, leaving as little as 2% of the original users in some datasets. Traditional algorithms achieved higher nDCG@10 scores when both training and testing on pruned data; however, this advantage largely disappeared when evaluated on unpruned test sets. Across all algorithms, performance declined with increasing pruning levels when tested on unpruned data, highlighting the impact of dataset reduction on the performance of recommender algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cross-Scenario Unified Modeling of User Interests at Billion Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Framework for Studying Systemic Effects of Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.</description>

      <title>Fantastic (small) Retrievers and How to Train Them: mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 Tech Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 models, at two different parameter counts: 17M and 32M. As part of our research, we conduct numerous experiments to improve retrieval and late-interaction models, which we intend to distill into smaller models as proof-of-concepts. Our ultimate aim is to support retrieval at all scales, from large-scale retrieval which lives in the cloud to models that can run locally, on any device. mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a model that we hope will serve as a solid foundation backbone for all future experiments, representing the first version of a long series of small proof-of-concepts. As part of the development of mxbai-edge-colbert-v0, we conducted multiple ablation studies, of which we report the results. In terms of downstream performance, mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a particularly capable small model, outperforming ColBERTv2 on common short-text benchmarks (BEIR) and representing a large step forward in long-context tasks, with unprecedented efficiency.</description>

      <title>LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Agentic Retrieval with LLMs for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models (LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG -- demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Schema Linking: A Context-Aware Bidirectional Retrieval Approach for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements, which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover, SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>PluriHop: Exhaustive, Recall-Sensitive QA over Distractor-Rich Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48 pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score. Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a "check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful alternative to top-k methods.</description>

      <title>MedTrust-RAG: Evidence Verification and Trust Alignment for Biomedical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However, RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence, undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM) that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.</description>

      <title>Acquisition of interpretable domain information during brain MR image harmonization for content-based image retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images. PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image $\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.</description>

      <title>Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.</description>

      <title>Multimodal RAG for Unstructured Data:Leveraging Modality-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Hybrid Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</description>

      <title>Intent Clustering with Shared Pseudo-Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and is stable across multiple models and datasets.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Rubric-based Generative Verifier for Search-Augmented LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters. Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.</description>

      <title>TITAN: Graph-Executable Reasoning for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test: 13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sakana's AI Scientist: Bold Claims, Mixed Results, and a Promising Future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Sakana recently introduced the 'AI Scientist', claiming to conduct research autonomously, i.e. they imply to have achieved what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). The AI Scientist gained much attention, but a thorough independent evaluation has yet to be conducted.
  Our evaluation of the AI Scientist reveals critical shortcomings. The system's literature reviews produced poor novelty assessments, often misclassifying established concepts (e.g., micro-batching for stochastic gradient descent) as novel. It also struggles with experiment execution: 42% of experiments failed due to coding errors, while others produced flawed or misleading results. Code modifications were minimal, averaging 8% more characters per iteration, suggesting limited adaptability. Generated manuscripts were poorly substantiated, with a median of five citations, most outdated (only five of 34 from 2020 or later). Structural errors were frequent, including missing figures, repeated sections, and placeholder text like 'Conclusions Here'. Some papers contained hallucinated numerical results.
  Despite these flaws, the AI Scientist represents a leap forward in research automation. It generates full research manuscripts with minimal human input, challenging expectations of AI-driven science. Many reviewers might struggle to distinguish its work from human researchers. While its quality resembles a rushed undergraduate paper, its speed and cost efficiency are unprecedented, producing a full paper for USD 6 to 15 with 3.5 hours of human involvement, far outpacing traditional researchers.</description>

      <title>R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems</title>

Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns - stability - and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes - plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity. Although additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Purity and Diversity in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation from the Frequency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance. Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.</description>

      <title>ReMindRAG: Low-Cost LLM-Guided Knowledge Graph Traversal for Efficient RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.
