      <title>Non-Relativistic Limits of Bosonic and Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$. On the level of bosonic DFT this implies that the NR limit can be taken before imposing the strong constraint and breaking the duality symmetry. At the (finite) leading order this reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT. Assuming a convergent generalised metric for heterotic DFT, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, O$(D,D)$-invariant.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at 1-loop in the Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy around particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of a cloud of positive vacuum energy around particles created by the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a dynamical cavity. We show that if when one has only one mirror moving in a free space, in the vacuum state, all the energy transferred from the mirror to the field is converted into real particles, on the other hand, when considering a second and static mirror forming a cavity with the first, the same movement of the first mirror can lead to less energy being converted into real particles, with the difference being converted into positive vacuum energy around these particles.</description>

      <title>Positive Geometries, Corolla Polynomial and Gauge Theory Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He, and Yan (ABHY) discovered a convex realisation of the associahedron whose combinatorial and geometric structure generates tree-level amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory. In this paper, we identify S-matrix of Yang-Mills theory with a scalar obtained by contracting the canonical form of ABHY associahedron with a multi-vector field (MVF) in the kinematic space. Components of this MVF are determined by the combinatorial structures that underlie the associahedron and Corolla polynomial that was introduced by Kreimer, Sars, and van Suijlekom (KSVS) in [2]. KSVS used the Corolla polynomial to obtain (at all orders in the loop expansion) the parametric representation of gauge theory Feynman integral from the corresponding Feynman integral in $\phi^{3}$ theory. Using the full power of Corolla polynomial, we then extend these results to obtain Yang-Mills one loop planar integrand by contracting the Corolla generated MVF with the canonical form defined by $\hat{D}_{n}$ polytope discovered by Arkani-Hamed, Frost, Plamondon, Salvatori, Thomas. We also demonstrate that KSVS representation of Corolla graph differential in the parametric space can be readily extended to "spin up" the curve integral formulae for $\textrm{Tr}\phi^{3}$ amplitude discovered in [3,4] and give an explicit construction of such formulae for tree-level and planar one loop gluon amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Operators in $AdS/CFT$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation function in Ads/CFT are correlation of the operator insertions on the boundary (at CFT) through the complete geometry of bulk. These are represented by Witten diagrams which at tree level doesn't have any quantum corrections. Generally, correlation functions are of low scaling (or conformal) dimension, $\Delta$, which is related to the mass of insertion of the scalar operator by, $\Delta(\Delta - 1) = m^2 L_{AdS}^2$. At low scaling dimensions the operator insertion on the CFT boundary does not back-react the metric of the geometry. On the other hand, at large scaling dimensions which scale with central charge the operator is considered heavy. This leads to an interesting question of what in the dual bulk (AdS) geometry of such heavy operators. At the heavy limit $\Delta = m L_{AdS}$, which means that the mass of the operator insertion is large too. The two-point function of heavy-operator is assumed to be Black hole in $(d+1)$-dimensions and the two-point form of CFT is recovered by calculating the action. In $3$-dimension we have more control over the geometry because of existence of exact metric called Ba\~nados metric with boundary stress-tensor insertion along with a map which maps it to Euclidean Poincare upper half plane. These methods are used to find the geometry for three-point function. The geometry is not simply of a black-hole but a wormhole solution for whose action is calculated which recovers the "square" of the classical DOZZ formula. We review the recent work of arXiv:2306.15105 and arXiv:2307.13188 in this thesis to form an understanding of heavy operators in the context of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy behavior of the de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. In the de Sitter spacetime, a cosmological horizon that constrains the causal accessible region of an observer, exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. From the principle of holography, the entropy within the causally connected region for an observer is constrained by the area of its boundary. This entropy bound is violated in the late stage of inflation. To address the issue of entropy bound violation from a perspective of quantum information, we adopt the stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. To reformulate the issue of entropy bound in the inflation, we follow the derivation of the Page curve in the black hole context. By adopting the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we obtain a meaningful entropy behavior in the de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>A note on integrated correlators with a Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the analysis of the integrated 2-point functions of local operators with a $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. After including suitable parity-odd terms in the parametrization of the defect correlators, we are able to solve the superconformal Ward identities in terms of an unconstrained function of the cross-ratios. Exploiting this general solution, we obtain a simple expression of the integration measure for the integrated correlators with a Wilson line. We test our result by integrating the available bootstrap expression of the unintegrated correlator at strong coupling against the predictions of supersymmetric localization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Global Symmetry and Integral Constraint on Superconformal Lines in Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of point-like impurities preserving flavor symmetry and supersymmetry in four-dimensional ${\cal N} = 2$ field theories. At large distances, such impurities are described by half-BPS superconformal line defects. By working in the $\text{AdS}_2\times \text{S}^2$ conformal frame, we develop a novel and simpler way of deriving the superconformal Ward identities relating the various two-point functions of flavor current multiplet operators in the presence of the defect. We use these relations to simplify a certain integrated two-point function of flavor current multiplet operators that, in Lagrangian theories, can be computed using supersymmetric localization. The simplification gives an integral constraint on the two-point function of the flavor current multiplet superconformal primary with trivial integration measure in the $\text{AdS}_2\times \text{S}^2$ conformal frame. We provide several consistency checks on our Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative correlation functions from homotopy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formula for correlation functions based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in arXiv:2203.05366, arXiv:2305.11634, and arXiv:2305.13103 requires dividing the action into the free part and the interaction part. We present a new form of the formula which does not involve such division. The new formula requires choosing a solution to the equations of motion which does not have to be real, and we claim that the formula gives correlation functions evaluated on the Lefschetz thimble associated with the solution we chose. Our formula correctly reproduces correlation functions in perturbation theory, but it can be valid nonperturbatively, and we present numerical evidence for scalar field theories in zero dimensions both in the Euclidean case and the Lorentzian case that correlation functions for finite coupling constants can be reproduced. When the theory consists of a single Lefschetz thimble, our formula gives correlation functions of the theory by choosing the solution corresponding to the thimble. When the theory consists of multiple Lefschetz thimbles, we need to evaluate the ratios of the partition functions for those thimbles and we describe a method of such evaluations based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>The Renormalization Group for Large-Scale Structure: Origin of Galaxy Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group equations for large-scale structure (RG-LSS) describe how the bias and stochastic (noise) parameters -- both of matter and biased tracers such as galaxies -- evolve as a function of the cutoff $\Lambda$ of the effective field theory. In previous work, we derived the RG-LSS equations for the bias parameters using the Wilson-Polchinski framework. Here, we extend these results to include stochastic contributions, corresponding to terms in the effective action that are higher order in the current $J$. We show that the RG equations exhibit an interesting, previously unnoticed structure at all orders in $J$, which implies that a single nonlinear bias term immediately generates all stochastic moments through RG evolution. We then derive the nonlinear RG evolution of the (leading-derivative) stochastic parameters for all $n$-point functions, and show that this evolution is controlled by a different, lower scale than the nonlinear scale. This has implications for the optimal choice of the renormalization scale when comparing the theory with data to obtain cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have presented a power law cosmological model and its dynamical system analysis in $f(T,\phi)$ gravity, where $T$ is the torsion scalar and $\phi$ is the canonical scalar field. The two well-motivated forms of the non-minimal coupling function $F(\phi)$, the exponential form and the power law form, with exponential potential function, are investigated. The dynamical system analysis is performed by establishing the dimensionless dynamical variables, and the critical points were obtained. The evolution of standard density parameters is analysed for each case. The behaviour of the equation of state (EoS) and deceleration parameter show agreement with the result of cosmological observations. The model parameters are constrained using the existence and the stability conditions of the critical points describing different epochs of the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-comoving description of adiabatic radial perturbations of relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adiabatic, radial perturbations of static, self-gravitating perfect fluids within the theory of general relativity employing a new perturbative formalism. We show that by considering a radially static observer, the description of the perturbations can be greatly simplified with respect to the standard comoving treatment. The new perturbation equations can be solved to derive analytic solutions to the problem for a general class of equilibrium solutions. We discuss the thermodynamic description of the fluid under isotropic frame transformations, showing how, in the radially static, non-inertial frame, the stress-energy tensor of the fluid must contain momentum transfer terms. As illustrative examples of the new approach, we study perturbations of equilibrium spacetimes characterized by the Buchdahl I, Heintzmann IIa, Patwardhan-Vaidya IIa, and Tolman VII solutions, computing the first oscillation eigenfrequencies and the associated eigenfunctions. We also analyze the properties of the perturbations of cold neutron stars composed of a perfect fluid verifying the Bethe-Johnson model I equation of state, computing the oscillation eigenfrequencies and the $e$-folding time.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Formula for the Multiple Scattering of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.</description>

      <title>Double Inflation in Classically Conformal $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model with two real Maxwell fields (or equivalently, a complex Maxwell field) minimally coupled to Einsteins gravity with a negative cosmological constant in four spacetime dimensions. Assuming a specific harmonic dependence of the vector fields, we show the existence of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) self-gravitating boson-star-like solitonic solutions, which are static and axially symmetric. Analytical solutions are found in the test-field limit, where the Maxwell equations are solved on a fixed AdS background. The fully nonlinear solutions are constructed numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

Abstract: We present de Sitter Teukolsky waves -- linearised quadrupolar gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge in de Sitter spacetime. In the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ going to zero limit, our solutions match to Teukolsky solutions. For non-zero $\Lambda$, we compare our solutions to the wider literature, where different authors have constructed linearised gravitational perturbations in de Sitter spacetime with varied motivations. For de Sitter Teukolsky waves, we compute the energy flux across future timelike infinity $\mathcal{I}^{+}$ and show that it is manifestly positive.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations with Timelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study static tidal Love numbers (TLNs) of a static and spherically symmetric black hole for odd-parity metric perturbations. We describe black hole perturbations using the effective field theory (EFT), formulated on an arbitrary background with a timelike scalar profile in the context of scalar-tensor theories. In particular, we obtain a static solution for the generalized Regge-Wheeler equation order by order in a modified-gravity parameter and extract the TLNs uniquely by analytic continuation of the multipole index $\ell$ to non-integer values. For a stealth Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs are vanishing as in the case of Schwarzschild solution in general relativity. We also study the case of Hayward black hole as an example of non-stealth background, where we find that the TLNs are non-zero (or there is a logarithmic running). This result suggests that our EFT allows for non-vanishing TLNs and can in principle leave a detectable imprint on gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems, which opens a new window for testing gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>The classical double copy in curved spacetimes: Perturbative Yang-Mills from the bi-adjoint scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a version of the double copy for classical fields in curved spacetimes. We provide a correspondence between perturbative solutions to the bi-adjoint scalar equations and those of the Yang-Mills equations in position space. At the linear level, we show that there exists a map between these solutions for maximally symmetric spacetime backgrounds, that provides every Yang-Mills solution by the action of an appropriate differential operator on a bi-adjoint scalar solution. Given the existence of a linearized map, we show that it is possible to cast the solutions of the Yang-Mills equations at arbitrary perturbation order in terms of the corresponding bi-adjoint scalar solutions. This all-order map is reminiscent of the flat space BCJ double copy, and works for any curved spacetime where the perturbative expansion holds. We show that these results have the right flat space limit, and that the correspondence is agnostic to the choice of gauge.</description>

Abstract: We study generalizations of the non-invertible duality defects present in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SU(N) SYM by studying theories with larger duality groups. We focus on 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ obtained by the dimensional reduction of the 6d $\mathcal{N} = (2, 0)$ theory of $A_{N-1}$ type on a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ without punctures. We discuss their non-invertible duality symmetries and provide two ways to compute their fusion algebra: either using discrete topological manipulations or a 5d TQFT description. We also introduce the concept of "rank" of a non-invertible duality symmetry and show how it can be used to (almost) completely fix the fusion algebra with little computational effort.</description>

      <title>From 5d Flat Connections to 4d Fluxes (the Art of Slicing the Cone)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Coulomb branch partition function of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected quasi-toric manifolds $B$. This includes a large class of theories, localising to either instantons or anti-instantons at the torus fixed points (including Donaldson-Witten and Pestun-like theories as examples). The main difficulty is to obtain flux contributions from the localisation procedure. We achieve this by taking a detour via the 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ vector multiplet on closed simply-connected toric Sasaki-manifolds $M$ which are principal $S^1$-bundles over $B$. The perturbative partition function can be expressed as a product over slices of the toric cone. By taking finite quotients $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ along the $S^1$, the locus picks up non-trivial flat connections which, in the limit $h\to\infty$, provide the sought-after fluxes on $B$. We compute the one-loop partition functions around each topological sector on $M/\mathbb{Z}_h$ and $B$ explicitly, and then factorise them into contributions from the torus fixed points. This enables us to also write down the conjectured instanton part of the partition function on $B$.</description>

      <title>Large N instantons from topological strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $1/N$ expansion of matrix models is asymptotic, and it requires non-perturbative corrections due to large $N$ instantons. Explicit expressions for large $N$ instanton amplitudes are known in the case of Hermitian matrix models with one cut, but not in the multi-cut case. We show that the recent exact results on topological string instanton amplitudes provide the non-perturbative contributions of large $N$ instantons in generic multi-cut, Hermitian matrix models. We present a detailed test in the case of the cubic matrix model by considering the asymptotics of its $1/N$ expansion, which we obtain at relatively high genus for a generic two-cut background. These results can be extended to certain non-conventional matrix models which admit a topological string theory description. As an application, we determine the large $N$ instanton corrections for the free energy of ABJM theory on the three-sphere, which correspond to D-brane instanton corrections in superstring theory. We also illustrate the applications of topological string instantons in a more mathematical setting by considering orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. By focusing on the example of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$, we show that they grow doubly-factorially with the genus and we obtain and test explicit asymptotic formulae for them.</description>

Abstract: We consider a massive fermionic quantum field localized on a plane in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane and the electric field is parallel. The complete set of solutions to the Dirac equation is presented. As important physical characteristics of the vacuum state, the fermion condensate and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor are investigated. The renormalization is performed using the Hurwitz function. The results are compared with those previously studied in the case of zero electric field. We discuss the behavior of the vacuum expectation values in different regions for the values of the problem parameters. Applications of the results include the electronic subsystem of graphene sheet described by the Dirac model in the long-wavelength approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10384v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an axis-symmetric and boost-invariant evolution in a relativistic quantum field theory which is best studied by mapping $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ to $dS_{3}\times \mathbf{R}$ when the field theory has conformal symmetry. We show that at late de-Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region of the future wedge within $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the holographic conformal field theory plasma can reach a state in which $\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We further determine the full sub-leading behaviour of the energy-momentum tensor at late time. Restricting to flows in which the energy density decays at large transverse distance from the central axis in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, we show that this decay should be faster than any power law. Furthermore, in this case the energy density also vanishes in $\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ faster than any power as we go back to early proper time. Hydrodynamic behavior can appear in intermediate time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the leading nonperturbative corrections to the strong-coupling (ungapped) phase of the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) integral over unitary matrices, to one-loop order. We compute these corrections directly in terms of eigenvalue tunneling in a holomorphic presentation of the integral over eigenvalues. The leading nonperturbative contribution to the partition function comes from a pair of complex eigenvalue instantons. We show that these are in fact "ghost instantons", which are extrema of the one-eigenvalue effective potential on the "unphysical sheet" of the spectral curve and have been discussed in detail recently by Mari\~no, Schiappa, and Schwick. Further, we discuss the relationship of these instantons to the Fredholm determinant expansion of the unitary matrix integral, which has recently become an object of interest in the computations of BPS indices of supersymmetric gauge theories and black holes. We find that, after taking the 't Hooft limit, the first correction given by the Fredholm determinant expansion of the GWW integral agrees precisely with the leading nonperturbative correction, to one-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear dilaton background is the keystone of a string-derived holographic correspondence beyond AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$. This motivates an exploration of the $(d+1)$-dimensional linear dilaton spacetime (LD$_{d+1}$) and its holographic properties from the low-energy viewpoint. We first notice that the LD$_{d+1}$ space has simple conformal symmetries, that we use to shape an effective field theory (EFT) on the LD background. We then place a brane in the background to study holography at the level of quantum fields and gravity. We find that the holographic correlators from the EFT feature a pattern of singularities at certain kinematic thresholds. We argue that such singularities can be used to bootstrap the putative $d$-dimensional dual theory using techniques analogous to those of the Cosmological Bootstrap program. Turning on finite temperature, we study the holographic fluid emerging on the brane in the presence of a bulk black hole. We find that the holographic fluid is pressureless for any $d$ due to a cancellation between Weyl curvature and dilaton stress tensor, and verify consistency with the time evolution of the theory. From the fluid thermodynamics, we find a universal temperature and Hagedorn behavior for any $d$. This matches the properties of a CFT$_2$ with large $T\overline T$ deformation, and of little string theory for $d=6$. Both the fluid equation of state and the spectrum of quantum fluctuations suggest that the $d$-dimensional dual theory arising from LD$_{d+1}$ is generically gapped.</description>

Abstract: This research study is primarily focus on investigating how the topological effects influence the eigenvalue solutions in the presence of a hot-dense medium. To accomplish this, we employ the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger wave equation, taking into consideration both the quantum flux field and an interaction potential. Through this approach, we determine the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our findings indicate that when we consider both the topological effects and the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, there is a noticeable reduction in the binding energy within the hot-dense medium. Additionally, we analyze the role of the baryonic potential in shaping the binding energy within the $(T, u_b)$ plane. Interestingly, it is evident that the influence of the baryonic potential becomes more pronounced as its values decrease</description>

      <title>The Minimal Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the minimal constraints imposed by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on the particle spectrum of a quantum gravity theory. Towers of super-extremal states have previously been argued to be required for consistency of the WGC under circle reduction. At the same time, there exist classes of theories where no tower of super-extremal particle states below the black hole threshold has been established with current techniques. We resolve this tension by arguing for the existence of a minimal radius for circle reductions of generic quantum gravity theories. Below this threshold, the notion of a circle compactification breaks down, bypassing the need for a tower of super-extremal states to satisfy the WGC after circle reduction. Based on this we propose that if a theory satisfies the WGC at the particle level below the black hole threshold, these states are sufficient for consistency under dimensional reduction, even in absence of a tower of super-extremal particles. Apart from general arguments, we provide independent evidence for this main result in F-, M- and string theory compactifications. According to the Emergent String Conjecture the only exception to the appearance of a minimal radius arises in asymptotically weak-coupling limits for heterotic strings, which aligns with the appearance of a weakly coupled super-extremal tower of particle states. This observation motivates a Minimal Weak Gravity Conjecture which states that towers of super-extremal particles occur if and only if they are required by consistency of the WGC under dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>High-energy behavior of scattering amplitudes in theories with purely virtual particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of renormalizable quantum field theories with purely virtual particles that exhibits nonrenormalizable behavior in the high-energy limit of scattering cross sections, which grow as powers of the center-of-mass energy squared and seems to violate unitarity bounds. We point out that the problem should be viewed as a violation of perturbativity, instead of unitarity, and show that the resummation of self energies fixes the issue. As an explicit example, we consider a class of $O(N)$ theories at the leading order in the large-$N$ expansion and show that the different quantization prescription of purely virtual particles takes care of the nonrenormalizable behavior, making the resummed cross sections to decrease at high energies and the amplitudes to satisfy the unitarity bounds. We compare the results to the case of theories with ghosts, where the resummation cannot change the behavior of cross sections due to certain cancellations in the high-energy expansion of the self energies. These results are particularly relevant for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Double-well instantons in finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a toroidal space with finite volume, we derive analytically the full one-loop vacuum energy for a scalar field tunnelling between two degenerate vacua, taking into account discrete momentum. The Casimir energy is computed for an arbitrary number of dimensions using the Abel-Plana formula, while the one-loop instanton functional determinant is evaluated using the Green's functions for the fluctuation operators. The resulting energetic properties are non-trivial: both the Casimir effect and tunnelling contribute to the Null Energy Condition violation, arising from a non-extensive true vacuum energy. We discuss the relevance of this mechanism to induce a cosmic bounce, requiring no modified gravity or exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity and post-Newtonian dynamics of compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.07240v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian formalisms provide powerful tools for the computation of approximate analytic solutions of the Einstein field equations. The post-Newtonian computations of the explicit analytic dynamics and motion of compact binaries are discussed within the most often applied Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. The obtention of autonomous Hamiltonians is achieved by the transition to Routhians. Order reduction of higher derivative Hamiltonians results in standard Hamiltonians. Tetrad representation of general relativity is introduced for the tackling of compact binaries with spinning components. Compact objects are modeled by use of Dirac delta functions and their derivatives. Consistency is achieved through transition to $d$-dimensional space and application of dimensional regularization. At the fourth post-Newtonian level, tail contributions to the binding energy show up for the first time. The conservative dynamics of binary systems finds explicit presentation and discussion through the fifth post-Newtonian order for spinless masses. For masses with spin Hamiltonians are known through (next-to)$^3$-leading-order spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings as well as through next-to-leading order cubic and quartic in spin interactions. Parts of those are given explicitly. Tidal-interaction Hamiltonians are considered through (next-to)$^2$-leading post-Newtonian order. The radiation reaction dynamics is presented explicitly through the third-and-half post-Newtonian order for spinless objects, and, for spinning bodies, to leading-order in the spin-orbit and spin1-spin2 couplings. The most important historical issues get pointed out.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $n$-point differentials corresponding to Kadomtsev-Petviashvili tau functions of hypergeometric type (also known as Orlov-Scherbin partition functions), with an emphasis on their $\hbar^2$-deformations and expansions. Under the naturally required analytic assumptions, we prove certain higher loop equations that, in particular, contain the standard linear and quadratic loop equations, and thus imply the blobbed topological recursion. We also distinguish two large families of the Orlov-Scherbin partition functions that do satisfy the natural analytic assumptions, and for these families we prove in addition the so-called projection property and thus the full statement of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. A particular feature of our argument is that it clarifies completely the role of $\hbar^2$-deformations of the Orlov-Scherbin parameters for the partition functions, whose necessity was known from a variety of earlier obtained results in this direction but never properly understood in the context of topological recursion. As special cases of the results of this paper one recovers new and uniform proofs of the topological recursion to all previously studied cases of enumerative problems related to weighted double Hurwitz numbers. By virtue of topological recursion and the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula this, in turn, gives new and uniform proofs of almost all ELSV-type formulas discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Faces of Cosmological Polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cosmological polytope is a lattice polytope introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa, and Postnikov in their study of the wavefunction of the universe in a class of cosmological models. More concretely, they construct a cosmological polytope for any Feynman diagram, i.e. an undirected graph. In this paper, we initiate a combinatorial study of these polytopes. We give a complete description of their faces, identify minimal faces that are not simplices and compute the number of faces in specific instances. In particular, we give a recursive description of the $f$-vector of cosmological polytopes of trees.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of a massless scalar field in a Schwarzschild black hole, which is deformed due to noncommutative corrections. We introduce the deformed Schwarzschild black hole solution, which depends on the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$. We then extract the master equation as a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving the explicit expression of the effective potential which is modified due to the noncommutative corrections. After that, we solve the master equation numerically. The significance of these results is twofold. Firstly, our results can be related to the detection of gravitational waves by the near future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, which will have a significantly increased accuracy. In particular, these observed gravitational waves produced by binary strong gravitational systems have oscillating modes which can provide valuable information. Secondly, our results can serve as an additional tool to test the predictions of GR, as well as to examine the possible detection of this kind of gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy for spherically symmetric regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes are here considered as standard configurations of spherically symmetric regular black holes. Assuming the thermodynamics of such objects to be analogous to standard black holes, we compute the island formula in the regime of small topological charge and large vacuum energy, respectively for Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes. Late and early-time domains are separately discussed, with particular emphasis on the island formations. We single out conditions under which it is not possible to find out islands at early-times and how our findings depart from the standard Schwarzschild case. Motivated by the fact that those configurations extend Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics through the inclusion of regularity behavior at $r=0$, we show how the effect of regularity induces modifications on the overall entanglement entropy. Finally, the Page time is also computed, showing its asymptotic behavior. Specifically, the Page time exhibits slight departures with respect to the Schwarzschild case, more evident in the Hayward metric only. Conversely, our findings on Page time show that the Bardeen regular black hole is quite indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warp-drives are solutions of general relativity widely considered unphysical due to high negative energy requirements. While the majority of the literature has focused on macroscopic solutions towards the goal of interstellar travel, in this work we explore what happens in the small radius limit. In this regime the magnitude of the total negative energy requirements gets smaller than the energy contained in a lightning bolt, more than 70 orders of magnitude less than the original Alcubierre warp drive. Such an amount could conceivably be generated with current technology by scaling up Casimir-like apparatuses. We then describe a tubular distribution of externally-generated negative energy which addresses the major issues plaguing macroscopic warp-drives and propose a concrete mechanism to accelerate and decelerate a warp. A byproduct of warp deceleration is the emission of a ray of high-energy particles. The detection of such particles could be used as the backbone of a faster-than-light communication device, reminiscent of the hyperwave of science fiction, even though significant engineering challenges remain to achieve practical communication.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields in Bonnor-Melvin Universe with potential: A study of dynamics of spin-0 particles-antiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research focus on the investigation of relativistic quantum dynamics of spin0 scalar particles/fields through the utilization of the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation within the framework of an electrovacuum space-time in the presence of an external scalar potential. Specifically, we focus on a cylindrical symmetric Bonnor-Melvin magnetic universe with a cosmological constant, where the magnetic field aligns along the symmetry axis direction. We derive the radial wave equation of the KG-equation by considering a Cornell-type scalar potential in the background of magnetic universe and successfully obtain an analytical eigenvalue solution for spin-0 quantum system. Notably, our findings reveal that both the energy spectrum and the corresponding radial wave function are significantly influenced by the presence of the cosmological constant, the topology parameter of the space-time geometry, which induces a deficit in the angular coordinates, and the potential parameters.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the Non-minimally Coupled Gravity with Electromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wormholes are geometric passages in spacetime which can connect two faraway regions of the same universe or two different universes with a shortcut. Although they are currently considered as hypothetical, they might be important observable structures that allow even time travel. But their general relativistic construction requires an exotic matter with negative energy density. The construction of wormholes containing realistic matter is a very important challenge. Therefore, in this work we investigate wormholes in the model which is non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity. Then we give some traversable wormhole geometries with realistic matter.</description>

      <title>Degenerate conformal blocks for the $W_3$ algebra at c=2 and Specht polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a homogeneous system of $d+8$ linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in $d$ variables arising from two-dimensional Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with a $W_3$-symmetry algebra. In the CFT context, $d$ PDEs are third order and correspond to the null-state equations, whereas the remaining 8 PDEs (five being second order and three being first order) correspond to the $W_3$ global Ward identities. In the case of central charge $c=2$, we construct a subspace of the space of all solutions which grow no faster than a power law. We call this subspace the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks, and we provide a basis expressed in terms of Specht polynomials associated with column-strict, rectangular Young tableaux with three columns. The dimension of this space is a Kotska number and it coincides with CFT predictions, hence we conjecture that it exhausts the space of all solutions having a power law bound. Moreover, we prove that the space of $W_3$ conformal blocks is an irreducible representation of a certain diagram algebra defined from $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs that we call Kuperberg algebra. Finally, we formulate a precise conjecture relating the $W_3$ conformal blocks at $c=2$ to scaling limits of probabilities in the triple dimer model recently studied by Kenyon and Shi. We verify the conjecture for explicit examples up to $d=6$. For more general central charges, we expect that $W_3$ conformal blocks are related to scaling limits of probabilities in lattice models based on $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ webs.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints for K3 surfaces and monodromy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of stable torsion free sheaves on a surface with only $(p,p)$-cohomology were recently proved by Bojko-Moreira-Lim. The rank 1 case, which is not restricted to surfaces with only $(p,p)$-cohomology, was established by Moreira. We prove Virasoro constraints for K3 surfaces using Markman monodromy operators, which allow us to reduce to the rank 1 case. We also prove new Virasoro constraints in rank 0. Finally, for K3 surfaces, we introduce new Virasoro operators in negative degree which, together with the previous Virasoro operators, give a representation of Virasoro algebra with central charge $24$.</description>
