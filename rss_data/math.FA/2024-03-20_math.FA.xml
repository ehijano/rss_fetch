      <title>$K_{0}$-groups and strongly irreducible decompositions of operator tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operator tuple $\mathbf{T}=(T_{1},\ldots,T_{n})$ is called strongly irreducible (SI), if the joint commutant of $\mathbf{T}$ does not any nontrivial idempotent operator. In this paper, we study the uniqueness of finitely strong irreducible decomposition of operator tuples up to similarity by $K$-theory of operator algebra, and give the algebraically similarity invariants of the Cowen-Douglas tuple with index 1 by using $K_{0}$-group of the commutant of operator tuples. As an application, we calculate $K_{0}$-groups of some multiplier algebras, and describe the similarity of backwards multishifts on Drury-Arveson space by means of inflation theory.</description>

      <title>On the (Local) Lifting Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (Local) Lifting Property ((L)LP) is introduced by Kirchberg and deals with lifting completely positive maps. We give a characterization of the (L)LP in terms of lifting $\ast$-homomorphisms. We use it to prove that if $A$ and $B$ have the LP and $F$ is their finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra, then $A\ast_F B$ has the LP. This answers a question of Ozawa.
  We prove that Exel's soft tori have the LP. As a consequence we obtain that $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ is inductive limit of RFD C*-algebras with the LP.
  We prove that for a class of C*-algebras including $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ and all contractible C*-algebras, the LLP is equivalent to Ext being a group.
  As byproduct of methods developed in the paper we generalize Kirchebrg's theorem about extensions with the WEP, give short proofs of several, old and new, facts about soft tori, new unified proofs of Li and Shen characterization of RFD property of free products amalgamated over a finite-dimensional subalgebra and Blackadar's characterization of semiprojectivity of them, and we show that the class of C*-algebras with the LP is closed under cross products with amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Fourier spectrum via Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier spectrum is a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions and are defined in terms of certain energies which capture Fourier decay. In this paper we obtain a convenient discrete representation of those energies using the Fourier coefficients. As an example application, we use this representation to establish sharp bounds for the Fourier spectrum of a general measure with bounded support, improving previous estimates of the second-named author</description>

      <title>A geometric characterisation of real C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the positive cone of a real C*-algebra geometrically. Given an open cone $\Omega$ in a real Banach space $V$, with closure $\overline \Omega$, we show that $\Omega$ is the interior of the positive cone of a unital real C*-algebra if and only if it is a Finsler symmetric cone with an orientable extension, which is equivalent to the condition that $V$ is, in an equivalent norm, the hermitian part of a unital real C*-algebra with positive cone $\overline\Omega$.</description>

      <title>On the openness of the idempotent barycenter map related to a t-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the idempotent barycenter map, associated with a t-norm $\ast$, is open if and only if the map of max-$\ast$ convex combination is open. As a corollary, we deduce that the idempotent barycenter map is open for spaces of idempotent measures associated with any t-norm $\ast$. Nevertheless, we illustrate that the characteristics of the idempotent barycenter map, in general, depend on the specific t-norm being employed.</description>

      <title>An inhomogeneous porous medium equation with non-integrable data: asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior as $t\to+\infty$ of solutions to a weighted porous medium equation in $ \mathbb{R}^N $, whose weight $\rho(x)$ behaves at spatial infinity like $ |x|^{-\gamma} $ with subcritical power, namely $ \gamma \in [0,2) $. Inspired by some results by Alikakos-Rostamian and Kamin-Ughi from the 1980s on the unweighted problem, we focus on solutions whose initial data $u_0(x)$ are not globally integrable with respect to the weight and behave at infinity like $ |x|^{-\alpha} $, for $\alpha\in(0,N-\gamma)$. In the special case $ \rho(x)=|x|^{-\gamma} $ and $ u_0(x)=|x|^{-\alpha} $ we show that self-similar solutions of Barenblatt type, i.e. reminiscent of the usual source-type solutions, still exist, although they are no longer compactly supported. Moreover, they exhibit a transition phenomenon which is new even for the unweighted equation. We prove that such self-similar solutions are attractors for the original problem, and convergence takes place globally in suitable weighted $ L^p $ spaces for $p\in[1,\infty)$ and even globally in $L^\infty$ under some mild additional regularity assumptions on the weight. Among the fundamental tools that we exploit, it is worth mentioning a global smoothing effect for non-integrable data.</description>

Abstract: We present a complete classification of $\operatorname{SL}(n)$ contravariant, $C(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{o\})$-valued valuations on polytopes, without any additional assumptions.It extends the previous results of the second author [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2020] which have a good connection with the $L_p$ and Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory. Additionally, our results deduce a complete classification of $\operatorname{SL}(n)$ contravariant symmetric-tensor-valued valuations on polytopes.</description>

      <title>Continuous warped time-frequency representations - Coorbit spaces and discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.05439v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel family of continuous, linear time-frequency transforms adaptable to a multitude of (nonlinear) frequency scales. Similar to classical time-frequency or time-scale representations, the representation coefficients are obtained as inner products with the elements of a continuously indexed family of time-frequency atoms. These atoms are obtained from a single prototype function, by means of modulation, translation and warping. By warping we refer to the process of nonlinear evaluation according to a bijective, increasing function, the warping function. Besides showing that the resulting integral transforms fulfill certain basic, but essential properties, such as continuity and invertibility, we will show that a large subclass of warping functions gives rise to families of generalized coorbit spaces, i.e. Banach spaces of functions whose representations possess a certain localization. Furthermore, we obtain sufficient conditions for subsampled warped time-frequency systems to form atomic decompositions and Banach frames. To this end, we extend results previously presented by Fornasier and Rauhut to a larger class of function systems via a simple, but crucial modification. The proposed method allows for great flexibility, but by choosing particular warping functions $\Phi$ we also recover classical time-frequency representations, e.g. $\Phi(t) = ct$ provides the short-time Fourier transform and $\Phi(t) = log_a(t)$ provides wavelet transforms. This is illustrated by a number of examples provided in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>On a class of bivariate distributions built of q-ultraspherical polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13652v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our primary result concerns the positivity of specific kernels constructed using the $q$-ultraspherical polynomials. In other words, it concerns a two-parameter family of bivariate, compactly supported distributions. Moreover, this family has a property that all its conditional moments are polynomials in the conditioning random variable. The significance of this result is evident for individuals working on distribution theory, orthogonal polynomials, $q$-series theory, and the so-called quantum polynomials. Therefore, it may have a limited number of interested researchers. That is why, we put our results into a broader context. We recall the theory of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and the idea of Lancaster expansions of the bivariate distributions absolutely continuous with respect to the product of their marginal distributions. Applications of Lancaster expansion can be found in Mathematical Statistics or the creation of Markov processes with polynomial conditional moments (the most well-known of these processes is the famous Wiener process).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence phenomenon in Wiener chaoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an unexpected phenomenon of strong regularization along normal convergence on Wiener chaoses. For every sequence of chaotic random variables, convergence in law to the Gaussian distribution is upgraded to superconvergence: the regularity of the densities increases along the convergence, and all the derivatives converges uniformly. Our findings strengthen known results regarding modes of convergence for normal approximation on Wiener chaoses. Without additional assumptions, convergence in total variation is established by Nourdin &amp; Peccati, and later on amplified to convergence in relative entropy by Nourdin, Peccati &amp; Swan. Our result is then extended to the multivariate setting, and for polynomial mappings of a Gaussian field provided the projection on the Wiener chaos of maximal degree admits a non-degenerate Gaussian limit. While our findings apply to any context involving polynomials of a Gaussian field, we emphasize applications regarding: improved Carbery-Wright estimates near Gaussianity; normal convergence in entropy and in Fisher information; superconvergence for the spectral moments of GOE; moments bounds for the inverse of strongly correlated Wishart-type matrices; superconvergence in the Breuer-Major Theorem. Our proofs leverage Malliavin's historical idea to establish smoothness of the density via the existence of negative moments of the Malliavin gradient, and we develop a new paradigm to study this problem. We relate the existence of negative moments to spectral quantities associated with the Malliavin Hessian. This link relies on an adequate choice of the Malliavin gradient, which provides a novel decoupling procedure of independent interest. Previous attempts to establish convergence beyond entropy have imposed restrictive assumptions ensuring finiteness of negative moments for the Malliavin derivatives. Our analysis renders these assumptions superfluous.</description>
