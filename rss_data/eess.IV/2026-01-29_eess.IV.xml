      <title>Orthogonal Plane-Wave Transmit-Receive Isotropic-Focusing Micro-Ultrasound (OPTIMUS) with Bias-Switchable Row-Column Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality structural volumetric imaging is a challenging goal to achieve with modern ultrasound transducers. Matrix probes have limited fields of view and element counts, whereas row-column arrays (RCAs) provide insufficient focusing. In contrast, Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as bias-switchable RCAs can enable isotropic focusing on par with ideal matrix probes, with a field of view surpassing conventional RCAs. Orthogonal Plane-Wave Transmit-Receive Isotropic-Focusing Micro-Ultrasound (OPTIMUS) is a novel imaging scheme that can use TOBE arrays to achieve nearly isotropic focusing throughout an expansive volume. This approach extends upon a similar volumetric imaging scheme, Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES), that is even able to image beyond the shadow of the aperture, much like typical 2D matrix probes. We simulate a grid of scatterers to evaluate how the resolution varies across the volume, and validate these simulations experimentally using a commercial calibration phantom. Experimental measurements were done with a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and a research ultrasound system. Finally we performed ex-vivo imaging to assess our ability to discern structural tissue information.</description>

      <title>SegRap2025: A Benchmark of Gross Tumor Volume and Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate delineation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), Lymph Node Clinical Target Volume (LN CTV), and Organ-at-Risk (OAR) from Computed Tomography (CT) scans is essential for precise radiotherapy planning in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Building upon SegRap2023, which focused on OAR and GTV segmentation using single-center paired non-contrast CT (ncCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) scans, the SegRap2025 challenge aims to enhance the generalizability and robustness of segmentation models across imaging centers and modalities. SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness. This paper presents the challenge setup and provides a comprehensive analysis of the solutions submitted by ten participating teams. For GTV segmentation task, the top-performing models achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 74.61% and 56.79% on the internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. For LN CTV segmentation task, the highest average DSC values reached 60.24%, 60.50%, and 57.23% on paired CT, ceCT-only, and ncCT-only subsets, respectively. SegRap2025 establishes a large-scale multi-center, multi-modality benchmark for evaluating the generalization and robustness in radiotherapy target segmentation, providing valuable insights toward clinically applicable automated radiotherapy planning systems.

      <title>Task-Based Adaptive Transmit Beamforming for Efficient Ultrasound Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless and wearable ultrasound devices promise to enable continuous ultrasound monitoring, but power consumption and data throughput remain critical challenges. Reducing the number of transmit events per second directly impacts both. We propose a task-based adaptive transmit beamforming method, formulated as a Bayesian active perception problem, that adaptively chooses where to scan in order to gain information about downstream quantitative measurements, avoiding redundant transmit events. Our proposed Task-Based Information Gain (TBIG) strategy applies to any differentiable downstream task function. When applied to recovering ventricular dimensions from echocardiograms, TBIG recovers accurate results using fewer than 2% of scan lines typically used, showing potential for large reductions in the power usage and data rates necessary for monitoring.

      <title>Leveraging Second-Order Curvature for Efficient Learned Image Compression: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20769v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training learned image compression (LIC) models entails navigating a challenging optimization landscape defined by the fundamental trade-off between rate and distortion. Standard first-order optimizers, such as SGD and Adam, struggle with \emph{gradient conflicts} arising from competing objectives, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization. Together, these results establish second-order optimization, achievable as a seamless drop-in replacement of the imported optimizer, as a powerful, practical tool for advancing the efficiency and real-world readiness of LICs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Next-Brain-Token Prediction for MEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20138v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large autoregressive model for source-space MEG that scales next-token prediction to long context across datasets and scanners: handling a corpus of over 500 hours and thousands of sessions across the three largest MEG datasets. A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls.

      <title>X-LRM: X-ray Large Reconstruction Model for Extremely Sparse-View Computed Tomography Recovery in One Second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D CT reconstruction aims to recover volumetric structures from a limited number of 2D X-ray projections. Existing feedforward methods are constrained by the scarcity of large-scale training datasets and the absence of direct and consistent 3D representations. In this paper, we propose an X-ray Large Reconstruction Model (X-LRM) for extremely sparse-view ($&lt;$10 views) CT reconstruction. X-LRM consists of two key components: X-former and X-triplane. X-former can handle an arbitrary number of input views using an MLP-based image tokenizer and a Transformer-based encoder. The output tokens are then upsampled into our X-triplane representation, which models the 3D radiodensity as an implicit neural field. To support the training of X-LRM, we introduce Torso-16K, a large-scale dataset comprising over 16K volume-projection pairs of various torso organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-LRM outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 1.5 dB and achieves 27$\times$ faster speed with better flexibility. Furthermore, the evaluation of lung segmentation tasks also suggests the practical value of our approach. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/Richard-Guofeng-Zhang/X-LRM</description>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets with expert annotations. In this work, we address this gap by introducing BRISC, a dataset designed for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks, featuring high-resolution segmentation masks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans, which were collated from multiple public datasets that lacked segmentation labels. Our primary contribution is the subsequent expert annotation of these images, performed by certified radiologists and physicians. It includes three major tumor types, namely glioma, meningioma, and pituitary, as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide benchmark results for both tasks using standard deep learning models. The BRISC dataset is made publicly available. datasetlink: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025/</description>

      <title>Random forest-based out-of-distribution detection for robust lung cancer segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework with PKCP-MixUp Augmentation for Pediatric Liver Tumor Diagnosis Using Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.</description>

      <title>JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

      <title>Neural Cellular Automata: From Cells to Pixels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired dynamical systems in which identical cells iteratively apply a learned local update rule to self-organize into complex patterns, exhibiting regeneration, robustness, and spontaneous dynamics. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution outputs. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information that impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing an NCA that evolves on a coarse grid with a lightweight implicit decoder that maps cell states and local coordinates to appearance attributes, enabling the same model to render outputs at arbitrary resolution. Moreover, because both the decoder and NCA updates are local, inference remains highly parallelizable. To supervise high-resolution outputs efficiently, we introduce task-specific losses for morphogenesis (growth from a seed) and texture synthesis with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our experiments across 2D/3D grids and mesh domains demonstrate that our hybrid models produce high-resolution outputs in real-time, and preserve the characteristic self-organizing behavior of NCAs.</description>

      <title>AGFS-Tractometry: A Novel Atlas-Guided Fine-Scale Tractometry Approach for Enhanced Along-Tract Group Statistical Comparison Using Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and related code are available at: https://github.com/ZhengRuixi/AGFS-Tractometry.git.</description>

      <title>AEDR: Training-Free AI-Generated Image Attribution via Autoencoder Double-Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</description>

      <title>WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.</description>

      <title>Targeted Pooled Latent-Space Steganalysis Applied to Generative Steganography, with a Fix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steganographic schemes dedicated to generated images modify the seed vector in the latent space to embed a message. Whereas most steganalysis methods attempt to detect the embedding in the image space, this paper proposes to perform steganalysis in the latent space by modeling the statistical distribution of the norm of the latent vector. Specifically, we analyze the practical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et al. for latent diffusion models, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is performed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent) vector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d. Gaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is possible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or Stego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A Likelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The impact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion steps is also studied. Additionally, we show how, by randomly sampling the norm of the latent vector before generation, the initial Stego scheme becomes undetectable in the latent space.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Efficient RFET-Based Stochastic Computing Neural Network Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers significant reductions in hardware complexity for traditional convolutional neural networks(CNNs). However, despite its advantages, stochastic computing neural networks (SCNNs) often suffer from high resource consumption due to components such as stochastic number generators (SNGs) and accumulative parallel counters (APCs), which limit overall performance. This paper proposes a novel SCNN architecture leveraging reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs). The inherent reconfigurability at the device level enables the design of highly efficient and compact SNGs, APCs, and other related essential components. Furthermore, a dedicated SCNN accelerator architecture is developed to facilitate system-level simulation. Based on accessible open-source standard cell libraries, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFET-based SCNN accelerator achieves significant reductions in area, latency, and energy consumption compared to its FinFET-based counterpart at the same technology node.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Semantic V2X Framework for Cooperative Collision Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</description>
