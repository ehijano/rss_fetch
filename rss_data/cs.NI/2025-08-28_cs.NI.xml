      <title>Connectivity Analysis of LoRaWAN-Based Non-Terrestrial Networks for Subterranean mMTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) offer significant social and economic benefits by enabling the monitoring of subterranean entities. However, the communication reliability of WUSNs diminishes in harsh environments where terrestrial network infrastructure is either unavailable or unreliable. To address this challenge, we explore the feasibility of integrating buried massive machine-type communication (mMTC) sensors with non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, to establish underground-to-NTN connectivity for various large-scale underground monitoring applications. To assess the effectiveness of underground-to-NTN connectivity, we develop a Monte Carlo simulator that incorporates a multi-layer underground attenuation model, the 3GPP empirical path loss model for various NTN platforms, and two LoRaWAN modulation schemes, i.e., LoRa and LoRa-frequency hopping spread spectrum (LR-FHSS). Our results evidence that LoRa SF7 is a strong candidate for short-range UAV communication in rural environments, while LR-FHSS modulation proves to be a promising option for HAP and LEO satellite platforms in massive WUSNs scenarios thanks to its adequate link budget and robustness to the interference. Finally, we demonstrate that the success probability of underground-to-NTN connectivity using LoRa and LR-FHSS is significantly affected by factors such as the monitoring environment, the number of devices, burial depth, and the soil's volumetric water content.</description>

      <title>Experimental Insights from OpenAirInterface 5G positioning Testbeds: Challenges and solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G New Radio (NR) is a key enabler of accurate positioning in smart cities and smart factories. This paper presents the experimental results from three 5G positioning testbeds running open-source OpenAirInterface (OAI) gNB and Core Network (CN), using Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) with the newly integrated Location Management Function (LMF). The testbeds are deployed across both indoor factories and outdoor scenarios with O-RAN Radio Units (RUs), following a 3GPP-compliant system model. The experiments highlight the impact of synchronization impairments, multipath propagation, and deployment geometry on positioning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose tailored ToA and TDoA filtering as well as a novel position estimation method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within the LMF pipeline. Moreover, we show a beyond-5G framework that leverages non-conventional measurements such as Channel Impulse Response (CIR) to train and test Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) models for data-driven positioning. The results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving 1-2 meter positioning accuracy in 90% of cases in different testbeds, offering practical insights for the design of robust 5G positioning systems. Moreover, we publicly release the datasets collected in this work to support the research within the 5G positioning community.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-LLM Agentic AI and Agentification for Edge General Intelligence by Zero-Trust: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentification serves as a critical enabler of Edge General Intelligence (EGI), transforming massive edge devices into cognitive agents through integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and perception, reasoning, and acting modules. These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures, forming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and specialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the collaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack surfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based security cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces zero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the ``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing the security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we present the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey key technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI. Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification, context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based management, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust applied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical strategies.</description>

      <title>2SYN: Congestion-Aware Multihoming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When sending flows to arbitrary destinations, current multihoming routers adopt simple congestion-oblivious mechanisms. Therefore, they cannot avoid congested paths.
  In this paper, we introduce 2SYN, the first congestion-aware multihoming algorithm that works for any destination. We explain how it dynamically selects a preferred path for new connections, even given previously-unseen destinations. We further demonstrate that it can be easily implemented in Linux. Finally, in a real-world experiment with either LTE or a wired link, we show how 2SYN dynamically adapts to the quality of the connection and outperforms alternative approaches. Thus, 2SYN helps companies better manage their networks by leveraging their multihoming capabilities.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Inter-Cell Interference in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cellular networks, inter-cell interference management has been studied for decades, yet its real-world effectiveness remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a first measurement study of inter-cell interference for operational 4G/5G networks. Our findings reveal the prevalence of inter-cell interference and a surprising absence of interference coordination among operational base stations. As a result, user equipments experience unnecessary interference, which causes significant signal quality degradation, especially under frequency-selective channel fading. We examine the inter-cell interference issues from four major perspectives: network deployment, channel assignment, time-frequency resource allocation, and network configuration. In none of these dimensions is inter-cell interference effectively managed. Notably, even when spectrum resources are underutilized and simple strategies could effectively mitigate inter-cell interference, base stations consistently prioritize using the same set of time-frequency resources, causing interference across cells. Our measurements reveal substantial opportunities for improving signal quality by inter-cell interference management.</description>

      <title>ML-MaxProp: Bridging Machine Learning and Delay-Tolerant Routing for Resilient Post-Disaster Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disaster-stricken and large-scale urban emergency scenarios, ensuring reliable communication remains a formidable challenge, as collapsed infrastructure, unpredictable mobility, and severely constrained resources disrupt conventional networks. Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs), though resilient through their store-carry-forward paradigm, reveal the fundamental weaknesses of classical protocols - Epidemic, Spray-and-Wait, and MaxProp - when confronted with sparse encounters, buffer shortages, and volatile connectivity. To address these obstacles, this study proposes ML-MaxProp, a hybrid routing protocol that strengthens MaxProp with supervised machine learning. By leveraging contextual features such as encounter frequency, hop count, buffer occupancy, message age, and time-to-live (TTL), ML-MaxProp predicts relay suitability in real time, transforming rigid heuristics into adaptive intelligence. Extensive simulations in the ONE environment using the Helsinki SPMBM mobility model show that ML-MaxProp consistently surpasses baseline protocols, achieving higher delivery probability, lower latency, and reduced overhead. Statistical validation further shows that these improvements are both significant and robust, even under highly resource-constrained and unstable conditions. Overall, this work shows that ML-MaxProp is not just an incremental refinement but a lightweight, adaptive, and practical solution to one of the hardest challenges in DTNs: sustaining mission-critical communication when infrastructure collapses and every forwarding decision becomes critical.</description>

      <title>When Routers, Switches and Interconnects Compute: A processing-in-interconnect Paradigm for Scalable Neuromorphic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routing, switching, and the interconnect fabric are essential for large-scale neuromorphic computing. While this fabric only plays a supporting role in the process of computing, for large AI workloads it ultimately determines energy consumption and speed. In this paper, we address this bottleneck by asking: (a) What computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and interconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a processing-in-Interconnect (\pi^2) computing paradigm? and (b) leveraging current and future interconnect trends, how will a \pi^2 system's performance scale compared to other neuromorphic architectures? For (a), we show that operations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays, causality, time-outs, packet drop, and broadcast operations -- primitives already implemented in packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. We show that existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be leveraged to implement neuron models and synaptic operations. Additionally, a knowledge-distillation framework can train and cross-map well-established neural network topologies onto $\pi^2$ without degrading generalization performance. For (b), analytical modeling shows that, unlike other neuromorphic platforms, the energy scaling of $\pi^2$ improves with interconnect bandwidth and energy efficiency. We predict that by leveraging trends in interconnect technology, a \pi^2 architecture can be more easily scaled to execute brain-scale AI inference workloads with power consumption levels in the range of hundreds of watts.</description>

      <title>RoboComm: A DID-based scalable and privacy-preserving Robot-to-Robot interaction over state channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a multi robot system establishing trust amongst untrusted robots from different organisations while preserving a robot's privacy is a challenge. Recently decentralized technologies such as smart contract and blockchain are being explored for applications in robotics. However, the limited transaction processing and high maintenance cost hinder the widespread adoption of such approaches. Moreover, blockchain transactions be they on public or private permissioned blockchain are publically readable which further fails to preserve the confidentiality of the robot's data and privacy of the robot. In this work, we propose RoboComm a Decentralized Identity based approach for privacy-preserving interaction between robots. With DID a component of Self-Sovereign Identity; robots can authenticate each other independently without relying on any third-party service. Verifiable Credentials enable private data associated with a robot to be stored within the robot's hardware, unlike existing blockchain based approaches where the data has to be on the blockchain. We improve throughput by allowing message exchange over state channels. Being a blockchain backed solution RoboComm provides a trustworthy system without relying on a single party. Moreover, we implement our proposed approach to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution.</description>

      <title>Online-Score-Aided Federated Learning: Taming the Resource Constraints in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) is a widely popular distributed machine learning (ML) strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous configurations of the wireless devices pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called online-score-aided federated learning (OSAFL), specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since clients' local training steps differ under resource constraints, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm without incurring any communication overheads to the clients or requiring any statistical data information from them. We theoretically show how the new factors, i.e., online score and local data distribution shifts, affect the convergence bound and derive the necessary conditions for a sublinear convergence rate. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks with multiple popular ML models validate the effectiveness of the proposed OSAFL algorithm compared to modified state-of-the-art FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Computation- and Communication-Efficient Online FL for Resource-Constrained Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.</description>
