      <title>Unsupervised Learning-based Calibration Scheme for the Rough Bergomi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning-based calibration schemes for rough volatility models are based on the supervised learning framework, which can be costly due to a large amount of training data being generated. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based scheme for the rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model which does not require accessing training data. The main idea is to use the backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) derived in \cite{bayer2022pricing} and simultaneously learn the BSDE solutions with the model parameters. We establish that the mean squares error between the option prices under the learned model parameters and the historical data is bounded by the loss function. Moreover, the loss can be made arbitrarily small under suitable conditions on the fitting ability of the rBergomi model to the market and the universal approximation capability of neural networks. Numerical experiments for both simulated and historical data confirm the efficiency of scheme.</description>

      <title>DeTEcT: Dynamic and Probabilistic Parameters Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.</description>
