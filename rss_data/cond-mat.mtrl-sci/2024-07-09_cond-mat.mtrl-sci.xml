      <title>TPDH-Graphene as a New Anodic Material for Lithium Ion Battery: DFT-Based Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal graphene (TPDH-gr), a recently proposed 2D carbon allotrope as an anodic material in lithium ion batteries (LIB), was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Li-atom adsorption is moderate (around 0.70 eV), allowing for easy desorption. Moreover, energy barrier, diffusion coefficient, and open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations show rapid Li atom diffusion on the TPDH-gr surface, stable intercalation of lithium atoms, and good performance during the charge and discharge cycles of the LIB. These findings, combined with the intrinsic metallic nature of TPDH-gr, indicate that this new 2D carbon allotrope is a promising candidate for use as an anodic LIB material.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model for Probing Solar Cell Dynamics via Cyclic Voltammetry and Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in emerging solar cell technologies such as hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, there are still significant limitations related to the stability of the devices and their non-ideal electrical behavior under certain external stimuli. We present a conceptual framework for characterizing photovoltaic devices by integrating cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (IS). This framework is constructed from a microscopic, multi-mode perspective that explicitly accounts for drift, diffusion, displacement, and memory contributions. We derive comprehensive analytical expressions for current-voltage relationships and complex admittance. Our model reveals the inseparable connection between hysteresis behaviors in current-voltage characteristics observed in CV and the apparent capacitive and inductive behaviors seen in IS spectral analysis. We demonstrate how CV and IS naturally complement each other, providing a deeper microscopic understanding of device performance and limitations. Additionally, we establish the relationship between intrinsic material parameters and experimentally accessible extrinsic parameters such as light intensity, temperature, DC bias, voltage amplitude, and frequency. This framework enables unprecedented optimization of solar cell performance, marking a significant advancement towards sustainability.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Data Mining, Active Learning, and Domain Adaptation in a Multi-Stage, Machine Learning-Driven Approach for the Efficient Discovery of Advanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing advanced catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable hydrogen production. This study introduces a novel, multi-stage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multi-metallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we establish an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially new benchmark in electrocatalysts research.</description>

      <title>In situ observation of thermally activated and localized Li leaching from lithiated graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature is known to impact Li-ion battery performance and safety, however, understanding its effect on Li-ion batteries has largely been limited to uniform high or low temperatures. While the insights gathered from such research are important, much less information is available on the effects of non-uniform temperatures which more accurately reflect the environments that Li-ion batteries are exposed to in real world applications. In this paper, we characterize the impact of a microscale, temperature hotspot on a Li-ion battery using a combination of in situ micro-Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy and COMSOL Multiphysics thermal simulations. Our results show that mild temperature heterogeneity induced by the micro-Raman laser can cause lithium to locally leach out from different lithiated graphite phases (LiC6 and LiC12) in the absence of an applied current. The Li metal is found to be largely localized to the region heated by the micro-Raman laser and is not observed upon uniform heating to comparable temperatures suggesting that temperature heterogeneity is uniquely responsible for causing Li to leach out from lithiated graphite phases. A mechanism whereby localized temperature heterogeneity induced by the laser induces heterogeneity in the degree of lithiation across the graphite anode is proposed to explain the localized Li leaching. This study highlights the sensitivity of lithiated graphite phases to minor temperature heterogeneity in the absence of an applied current.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Alloy Microstructure Segmentation through SAM and Domain Knowledge without Extra Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental models, trained on large-scale datasets and adapted to new data using innovative learning methods, have revolutionized various fields. In materials science, microstructure image segmentation plays a pivotal role in understanding alloy properties. However, conventional supervised modelling algorithms often necessitate extensive annotations and intricate optimization procedures. The segmentation anything model (SAM) introduces a fresh perspective. By combining SAM with domain knowledge, we propose a novel generalized algorithm for alloy image segmentation. This algorithm can process batches of images across diverse alloy systems without requiring training or annotations. Furthermore, it achieves segmentation accuracy comparable to that of supervised models and robustly handles complex phase distributions in various alloy images, regardless of data volume.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Micromechanical Evolution of Olivine Aggregates During Transient Creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To examine the microstructural evolution that occurs during transient creep, we deformed olivine aggregates to different strains that spanned the initial transient deformation. Two sets of samples with different initial grain sizes of 5 $\mu$m and 20 $\mu$m were deformed in torsion at T = 1523 K, P = 300 MPa, and a constant shear strain rate of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$. Both sets of samples experienced strain hardening during deformation. We characterized the microstructures at the end of each experiment using high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) and dislocation decoration. In the coarse-grained samples, dislocation density increased from 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ m$^{-2}$ to 3.6 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ m$^{-2}$ with strain. Although the same final dislocation density was reached in the fine-grained samples, it did not vary significantly at small strains, potentially due to concurrent grain growth during deformation. In both sets of samples, HR-EBSD analysis revealed that intragranular stress heterogeneity increased in magnitude with strain and that elevated stresses are associated with regions of high geometrically necessary dislocation density. Further analysis of the stresses and their probability distributions indicate that the stresses are imparted by long-range elastic interactions among dislocations. These characteristics indicate that dislocation interactions were the primary cause of strain hardening during transient creep. A comparison of the results to predictions from three recent models reveals that the models do not correctly predict the evolution in stress and dislocation density with strain for our experiments due to a lack of previous such data in their calibrations.</description>

      <title>Prolonged Phase Segregation of Mixed-Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical issue hindering the potential applications of semiconductor mixed-halide perovskites is the phase segregation effect, wherein localized regions enriched with one type of halide anions would be formed upon continuous photogeneration of the excited-state charge carriers. These unexpected phases are capable of remixing again in the dark under the entropic driving force, the process of which are now being exclusively studied after mixed-halide perovskites have arrived at the final stage of complete phase segregation. Here we show that after the removal of laser excitation from a solid film of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals with partial phase segregation, the iodide- and bromide-rich regions can continuously grow in the dark for a prolonged time period of several minutes. We propose that this dark phase segregation is sustained by the local electric fields associated with the surface-trapped charge carriers, whose slow dissipation out of mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals causes a delayed occurrence of the reversal phase remixing process.</description>

      <title>Towards ultrasensitive biosensors based on virus-like particles and plasmonic surface lattice resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic surface lattice resonance (SLR) is a phenomenon in which individual localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) excited in periodically-arranged plasmonic nanoparticles couple through the interaction with propagating diffracted incident light. The SLR optical absorption peak is by at least one order of magnitude more intense than the LSPR one, making SLR superior for applications in which LSPR is commonly used. Recently, we have developed a route for the fabrication of spherical virus-like particles (VLPs) with plasmonic cores and protein coronas, where the LSPR in the cores amplifies vibrational signals originating from protein-antibody bonding, showing the potential of VLPs in biodetection. However, the signals were not strong enough to detect antibodies at very low concentrations. Here, we show that by ordering the VLPs in periodic nanoarrays exhibiting SLR amplifies the signals by two orders of magnitude, revealing superior potential of SLR arrays in ultrasensitive biodetection.</description>

      <title>Carrier Dynamics in High-density Photo-doped MoS$_2$: Monolayer vs Multilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer and multilayer MoS$_2$ are extremely fascinating materials for the use in lasers, compact optical parametric amplifiers, and high-power detectors which demands high excitation light-matter interaction. Consequently, it is essential to understand the carrier dynamics in both the cases at such high excitation densities. In this work, we investigate the carrier dynamics of monolayer and multilayer MoS$_2$ at photo-doping densities around Mott Density. It is observed that, despite the similarity in band structure near K-point and formation of A-exciton, a substantial difference in the carrier dynamics is observed reflecting the influence of the entire band structure. The exciton dissociation, bandgap renormalization, and intervalley relaxation play a consequential role in dictating the ultrafast transient properties of these samples. The study in this paper provide a substantial understanding of fundamental optoelectronic properties of the two-dimensional MoS$_2$, paving a way for its potential applications in various photonic and optoelectronic domain.</description>

      <title>Imaging magnetic spiral phases, skyrmion clusters, and skyrmion displacements at the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfaces -- by breaking bulk symmetries, introducing roughness, or hosting defects -- can significantly influence magnetic order in magnetic materials. Determining their effect on the complex nanometer-scale phases present in certain non-centrosymmetric magnets is an outstanding problem requiring high-resolution magnetic microscopy. Here, we use scanning SQUID-on-tip microscopy to image the surface of bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperature and in a magnetic field applied along $\left\langle100\right\rangle$. Real-space maps measured as a function of applied field reveal the microscopic structure of the magnetic phases and their transitions. In low applied field, we observe a magnetic texture consistent with an in-plane stripe phase, pointing to the existence of a distinct surface state. In the low-temperature skyrmion phase, the surface is populated by clusters of disordered skyrmions, which emerge from rupturing domains of the tilted spiral phase. Furthermore, we displace individual skyrmions from their pinning sites by applying an electric potential to the scanning probe, thereby demonstrating local skyrmion control at the surface of a magnetoelectric insulator.</description>

      <title>First-principles prediction of point defect energies and concentrations in the tantalum and hafnium carbides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are combined with a statistical-mechanical model to predict the equilibrium point-defect concentrations in the refractory carbides TaC and HfC as a function of temperature and chemical composition. Several different types of point defects (vacancies, interstitials, antisite atoms) and their clusters are treated in a unified manner. The defect concentrations either strictly follow or can be closely approximated by Arrhenius functions with parameters predicted by the model. The model is general and applicable to other carbides, nitrides, borides, or similar chemical compounds. Implications of this work for understanding the diffusion mechanisms in TaC and HfC are discussed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Persistent Homology Features for Accurate Defect Formation Energy Predictions via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of defect formation energies are crucial to understanding defect properties in materials, such as favorable defect types and concentration, and to investigating the interplay between defects and other functional properties of materials. To overcome the computational expense of density-functional theory calculations in large supercells, several graph neural network (GNN) models were proposed to predict the defect formation energies. However, their performance is limited due to the fact that defect formation energies depend strongly on the local atomic configurations near the defect sites and to the over-smoothing problem of GNN. Herein, we demonstrate that persistent homology features, which characterize the topological structure of the local chemical environment around each atomic site, encode the structural information of defects (such as vacancies and substitutions), including the size of the defects, the number of defects near each atom, and the distance to those defects. Using the dataset comprising a wide spectrum of O-based perovskites with vacancies of various elemental type as an example, we construct and train the GNN models to predict the neutral vacancy formation energies, and show that incorporating the persistent homology features, along with proper choices of the graph pooling operations, significantly increases the prediction accuracy and overcomes the non-convergence issue with respect to the supercell size in previous GNN models. Furthermore, using defective BaTiO3 with multiple substitutions and multiple vacancies as examples, our GNN model can also predict the defect-defect interaction energies accurately. These results suggest that persistent homology features are highly effective in predicting defect-related properties and can be integrated into the vast family of advanced graph neural network models for future defect studies.</description>

      <title>Stable room-temperature multiferroic skyrmions in lithium niobate with enhanced Pockels effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium Niobate (LN) is a ferroelectric material with exceptional electrical characteristics, including high piezoelectricity, high Pockels effect, etc. These properties make it a promising platform for numerous fields such as high-speed communication, optical computation, and quantum information processing. Besides these, the introduction of magnetic structures to LN holds significant potential to achieve magnetoelectric coupling, which can be applied in magnetic memory and data-processing devices with high efficiency. Here, for the first time, we observe a special topological magnetic structure called magnetic skyrmion in LN (SK-LN) by the combination of magnetic field annealing and rapid annealing processes . Compared to the magnetic skyrmions reported in magnetic systems, SK-LN exhibit exceptionally high stability. Additionally, the center of the magnetic vortex exhibits spontaneous ferroelectric polarization, indicating its multiferroic characteristic. With the excitation of these multiferroic skyrmions, the modulation efficiency of the electro-optical (EO) modulator fabricated on thin film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) wafer was found to be enhanced from 1.98 V*cm to 0.63 V*cm. It is considered that the multiferroic skyrmions significantly enhance the Pockels coefficient of LN to 101 pm/V, nearly three times the result (32pm/V) reported previously.</description>

      <title>Powder X-Ray Diffraction Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally obtained X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can be difficult to solve, precluding the full characterization of materials, pharmaceuticals, and geological compounds. Herein, we propose a method based upon a multi-objective evolutionary search that uses both a structure's enthalpy and similarity to a reference XRD pattern (constituted by a list of peak positions and their intensities) to facilitate structure solution of inorganic systems. Because the similarity index is computed for locally optimized cells that are subsequently distorted to find the best match with the reference, this process transcends both computational (e.g. choice of theoretical method, and 0 K approximation) and experimental (e.g. external stimuli, and metastability) limitations. We illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to successfully uncover complex crystal structures by applying it to a range of test cases, including inorganic minerals, pure elements ramp-compressed to extreme conditions, and molecular crystals. The results demonstrate that our approach not only improves the accuracy of structure prediction but also significantly reduces the time required to achieve reliable solutions, thus providing a powerful tool for the advancement of materials science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Unmasking charge transfer in the Misfits: ARPES and ab initio prediction of electronic structure in layered incommensurate systems without artificial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common belief is that the large band shifts observed in incommensurate misfit compounds, e.g. (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2)2, are due to interlayer charge transfer. In contrast, our analysis, based on both ARPES measurements and a specialized ab initio framework employing only quantities well defined in incommensurate materials, demonstrates that the large band shifts instead reflect changes in valence band hybridization and interlayer bonding. The strong alignment of our ab initio predictions and ARPES measurements confirms our understanding of the incommensurate electronic structure and charge transfer.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic properties and microwave absorption capabilities are studied under real radar conditions for layer-type composite samples consisting of a polymeric matrix and a magnetic powder filler, either metallic or ceramic. The effect of the filler type and the filling factor is investigated. The obtained results show remarkable broadband microwave absorption, which make these materials suitable for stealth technology. The experimentally measured absorptions reach -40 dB, while model-based predictions suggest that these systems could overpass the barrier of -50 dB. The experimental results are supported by models, both for single and bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of multifold fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intensively studied in recent years. Besides the well known Weyl and Dirac semimetals, some materials posses nodes with linear crossing of multiple bands. Low energy excitations around these nodes are called multifold fermions and can be described by $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian with pseudospin greater than 1/2. In the present work we investigated the contribution of these states into orbital magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. We have found that, similarly to Weyl semimetals, the dependence of susceptibility on chemical potential $\mu$ shows an extremum when $\mu$ is close to the band crossing energy. In the case of half-integer pseudospin this extremum is a minumum and the susceptibility is negative (diamagnetic). While in the case of integer pseudospin the susceptibility is large and positive (paramagnetic) due to the contribution of dispersionless band. This leads also to nonmonotonic temperature dependence of $\chi$. As an example, we considered the case of cobalt monosilicide where the states near the $\Gamma$ point correspond to pseudospin 1 without spin-orbital interaction, and to a combination of Weyl node and pseudospin-3/2 states with the account of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Foams with 3D Spatially Programmed Mechanics Enabled by Autonomous Active Learning on Viscous Thread Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foams are versatile by nature and ubiquitous in a wide range of applications, including padding, insulation, and acoustic dampening. Previous work established that foams 3D printed via Viscous Thread Printing (VTP) can in principle combine the flexibility of 3D printing with the mechanical properties of conventional foams. However, the generality of prior work is limited due to the lack of predictable process-property relationships. In this work, we utilize a self-driving lab that combines automated experimentation with machine learning to identify a processing subspace in which dimensionally consistent materials are produced using VTP with spatially programmable mechanical properties. In carrying out this process, we discover an underlying self-stabilizing characteristic of VTP layer thickness, an important feature for its extension to new materials and systems. Several complex exemplars are constructed to illustrate the newly enabled capabilities of foams produced via VTP, including 1D gradient rectangular slabs, 2D localized stiffness zones on an insole orthotic and living hinges, and programmed 3D deformation via a cable driven humanoid hand. Predictive mapping models are developed and validated for both thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments, suggesting the ability to train a model for any material suitable for material extrusion (ME) 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (Strictly Localized Equivariant Message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Changes in Dislocation Punching Behavior Due to Hydrogen-Seeded Helium Bubble Growth in Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accumulation of gas atoms in tungsten is a topic of long-standing interest to the plasma-facing materials community due the metal's use as a divertor material in some tokamak fusion reactors. The nucleation and growth of He/H gas bubbles (along with their isotopes) can result from impinging fluxes of these gases which give rise to damage at the W divertor surface. The inclusion of He or H in W has been studied extensively by the community, finding that He bubbles modify the surface through periodic dislocation punching and bursting mechanisms while H bubbles impact the metal through plastic-strain induced material failure. However, the mechanisms which are present during the combined flux of both He and H is not well-studied atomistically. Motivated by this, an atomistic modeling study is conducted using molecular dynamics to assess the behavior of mixed concentration He:H bubbles in W. We find that the introduction of H into a growing He bubble results in a dramatic change in the nature and presence of dislocation loops which are typically generated via dislocation punching in over-pressurized He bubbles. Most notably, at high H concentrations, there is a switchover in energetic favorability from glissile 1/2$&lt;$111$&gt;$ dislocations to sessile $&lt;$100$&gt;$ dislocations. This thermodynamic crossover could imply a significant reduction in W surface morphology changes than with pure He bubbles and, additionally, we show this to have implications on the trapping of H in the bubbles and their associated dislocations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zn-Al-Mg coatings are characterized by a complex microstructure with dendritic and eutectic phases. This heterogeneous phase distribution contributes to multiple deformation and damage mechanisms. The presence of brittle phases promotes crack initiation and propagation. This study reveals a new deformation and damage mechanism of a Zn-Al-Mg coating, where twinning can induce crack initiation in the eutectic region. The chronology of different events leading to crack initiation and propagation is clearly established by in-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope, which helps to establish a detailed characterization of the mechanical behavior of the coating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of entanglement kinetics in polymer melts. We compare predictions of a recently developed constitutive equation for disentanglement to molecular dynamics simulations of both united-atom polyethylene and Kremer-Grest models for polymers in shear and extensional flow. We confirm that entanglements recover on the retraction timescale, rather than the reptation timescale. We find that the convective constraint release parameter $\beta$ is independent of molecular weight, but that it increases with the ratio of Kuhn length $b_K$ to packing length $p$ as $\beta\sim (b_K/p)^\alpha$, with an exponent $\alpha=1.9$, which may suggest that disentanglement rate correlates with an increase in the tube diameter. These results may help shed light on which polymers are more likely to undergo shear banding.</description>

      <title>Theory of Rashba splitting in quantum-well states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory pertaining to the asymptotic behavior of Rashba energy splitting in a quantum-well state (QWS). First, unlike previous studies, we derive $\textbf{k}$-linear Rashba term from a first-principles Hamiltonian in a physically convincing manner. The $\textbf{k}$-dependent in-plane intrinsic magnetic-field term originates from the spin--orbit interaction and hybridized $s$-$p_z$ orbital, whereas a steep nucleus potential realizes the linearity for the $\textbf{k}$ of the effective magnetic field. Next, we analyze the Rashba effect of a QWS using a one-dimensional tight-binding model developed based on the bottom-up approach that is aforementioned. The Rashba-splitting behavior of this system is captured from the density at the interface. The density can be expressed analytically as a function of the monolayer number and well depth. Finally, we apply our formula to the QWS of a few-monolayers Ag on an Au(111) surface to validate the theory based on a realistic system. Our tight-binding analysis qualitatively fits the first-principles result using only two fitting parameters and predicts the optimal condition for achieving a large Rashba splitting.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel collinear magnet, the altermagnet (AM) with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice model, widely used for heavy fermion compounds. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find the $d$-wave AM state can coexist with the intrinsic Kondo screening effect in such itinerant-local electron system if an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH) is included. Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds.</description>

      <title>Thermal Preconditioning of Membrane Stress to Control the Shapes of Ultrathin Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the phospholipid bilayer membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles as a free-standing environment for the growth of membrane-integrated ultrathin phospholipid crystals possessing a variety of shapes with 6-fold symmetry. Crystal growth within vesicle membranes, where more elaborate shapes grow on larger vesicles is dominated by the bending energy of the membrane itself, creating a means to manipulate crystal morphology. Here we demonstrate how cooling rate preconditions the membrane tension before nucleation, in turn regulating nucleation and growth, and directing the morphology of crystals by the time they are large enough to be visualized. The crystals retain their shapes during further growth through the two phase region. Experiments demonstrate this behavior for single crystals growing within the membrane of each vesicle, ultimately comprising up to 13% of the vesicle area and length scales of up to 50 microns. A model for stress evolution, employing only physical property data, reveals how the competition between thermal membrane contraction and water diffusion from tensed vesicles produces a size- and time-dependence of the membrane tension as a result of cooling history. The tension, critical in the contribution of bending energy in the fluid membrane regions, in turn selects for crystal shape for vesicles of a given size. The model reveals unanticipated behaviors including a low steady state tension on small vesicles that allows compact domains to develop, rapid tension development on large vesicles producing flower-shaped domains, and a stress relaxation through water diffusion across the membrane with a time constant scaling as the square of the vesicle radius, consistent with measurable tensions only in the largest vesicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) refers to the chirality- and current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in chiral conductors and is commonly interpreted in a semimclassical picture. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometry origin of EMCA by a chiral rectangular lattice model that resembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for EMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of graphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states contribute significantly to EMCA by the quantum metric when Fermi energy is close to the Dirac point. Besides, we discovered topological insulator state can emerge once SOC is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path to understand quantum geometry in the magneto-transport of chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Complex Smectic Phases in Polymer Grafted Shape-Uniform Cellulose Nano-Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of short chain grafting on the liquid crystalline (LC) ordering of nano-crystals is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained grafted nano-rod model. Monodisperse nano-rods, with aspect ratios typical of cellulose nano-crystals (CNCs) are grafted randomly with oligomers at different grafting densities. LC ordering depends non-trivially on grafting density as the effective nano-rod shape and softness is modified. Ungrafted rods exhibit Nematic and tilted Smectic-C phases. At 25\% grafting, the addition of a few side chains entirely suppresses Smectic order and instead a persistent Nematic phase is favoured. Intermediary grafting, around 50\%, results in a Nematic and the reappearance of tilted Smectic-F phases. Heavier grafting facilitates direct transitions to either Smectic-I with extreme tilt (75\%) or an un-tilted Smectic-B (100\%). Such behaviour falls outside of current hard or soft-rod descriptions of phase-transitions in rod-like LC systems and points to undiscovered LC behaviour in both shape-purified grafted/un-grafted CNCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a first-principles approach for calculating the topological Hall effect (THE) in magnets with noncollinear nanoscale spin textures. We employ a modeling method to determine the effective magnetic field induced by the spin texture, thereby circumventing the computational challenges associated with superlattice calculations. Based on these results, we construct a Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonian to characterize the electronic states and calculate the Hall conductivity. Applying this approach to the skyrmion material $\rm Gd_2PdSi_3$ shows good agreement with experimental data. Our analysis in momentum space further reveals that the dominant contribution to the THE arises from the crossing points between the folded bands along high-symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone. This work advances numerical techniques for simulating general magnetic system, examplified by but not restricted to skyrmion lattice, and its result offering insights into the complex interplay between spin textures and electronic transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05798v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Fabrication of diode by forming n-type electrical contact on germanium (Ge) and its AC impedance analysis is important for radiation detection in the form of pulses. In this work lithium (Li) metal has been electro-deposited on p-type Ge single crystal from molten lithium nitrate at 260{\deg}C. The depth of Li diffusion in Ge was successfully varied by changing the electroplating time as determined by sheet resistance (SR) measurement after successive lapping of Ge surface. Li is found to diffuse up to 500 micron inside Ge by heat treatment of as deposited Li/Ge at 350{\deg}C for 1 hour. A stable n-type electrical contact on Ge with SR ~1 ohm/square and impurity concentration ~3.7x10^15/cm^3 is developed by Li incorporation in p-type Ge crystal showing net carrier concentration ~3.4x10^10/cm^3 and SR ~100 Kohm/square. Acceptor concentration determined from the 1/C^2 vs V plot shows similar temperature dependence as found by Hall measurement. The fabricated n+/p junction exhibit ideal diode characteristics with gradual increase in cut off voltage at low temperatures. Under forward bias, junction capacitance mainly comprises of diffusion capacitance (~10 micro.F) showing strong frequency dependence and the impedance is partly resistive resulting in semicircular Cole-Cole plot. Imaginary impedance spectra reveal that the relaxation time for the diffusion of majority carriers decreases at higher temperatures and increased forward voltages. The diode is purely capacitive under reverse bias showing a line parallel to the y-axis in the Cole-Cole plot with frequency independent (100Hz-100MHz) depletion capacitance ~10pF.</description>

Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising photonic materials for fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Their potential for nonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date, continuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate CW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate optical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics. Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our approach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis measurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid state in an emergent honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rare-earth-based frustrated magnets, the synergistic interplay between spin correlations, spin-orbit coupling and competing exchange interactions provide a promising route to realize exotic quantum states with nontrivial excitations. Here, through thermodynamic and local-probe measurements down to 16 mK, we demonstrate the exotic magnetism and spin dynamics in the nearly perfect emergent honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet TbBO3. The latter embodies a frustrated lattice with a superimposed triangular lattice, constituted by additional Tb3+ ions at the center of each hexagon. Thermodynamic experiments reveal the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with no indications of either long-range order or spin freezing down to 50 mK. Despite sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Tb3+ moments, muon-spin relaxation does not detect any signatures of long-range magnetic order or spin-freezing down to 16 mK. This suggests that the spin-orbit-driven anisotropic exchange interaction engenders a strong frustration, crucial to induce persistent spin dynamics. The specific-heat data exhibit a T^2.2 power-law behavior at low temperatures, suggesting gapless excitations consistent with theoretical predictions. The scaling of muon relaxation rate as a function of the characteristic energy scale for several spin-liquid candidates, including TbBO3, demonstrates a thermally activated behavior. This is consistent with NMR results on TbBO3 and reminiscent of a universal QSL behavior, here attributed to short-range spin correlations. Our experimental results are supported by density functional theory + Hubbard U and crystal electric-field calculations, which propose TbBO3 as a promising platform to realize the theoretically proposed quantum disorder state in an anisotropy-driven frustrated honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts from numerical approaches to complement experimental measurements, several fundamental challenges have still hindered one's ability to truly provide an atomistic picture of the nucleation process in nanocrystals. Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1) Machine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture the finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven characterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape associated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a large range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling. Altogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide crystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that different nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of supercooling.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast energy-dispersive soft-x-ray diffraction in the water window with a laser-driven source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved soft-x-ray-diffraction experiments give access to microscopic processes in a broad range of solid-state materials by probing ultrafast dynamics of ordering phenomena. While laboratory-based high-harmonic generation (HHG) light sources provide the required photon energies, their limited photon flux is distributed over a wide spectral range, rendering typical monochromatic diffraction schemes challenging. Here, we present a scheme for energy-dispersive soft-x-ray diffraction with femtosecond temporal resolution and photon energies across the water window from 200 to 600 eV. The experiment utilizes the broadband nature of the HHG emission to efficiently probe large slices in reciprocal space. As a proof-of-concept, we study the laser-induced structural dynamics of a Mo/Si superlattice in an ultrafast, non-resonant soft-x-ray diffraction experiment. We extract the underlying strain dynamics from the measured shift of its first order superlattice Bragg peak in reciprocal space at photon energies around 500 eV via soft-x-ray scattering simulations.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity up to 14.2 K in MnB$_4$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in 3$d$-transition metal compounds with strong magnetism is interesting but rare. Especially for Mn-based compounds, there exist only very limited materials that show superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity up to 14.2 K in a Mn-based material MnB$_4$. By applying high pressures, we found the continuous suppression of a weak insulating behavior and the occurrence of superconductivity after about 30 GPa. With further increasing pressure, $T_\text{c}$ is gradually enhanced and reaches the maximum value of about 14.2 K at 150 GPa with a Fermi-Liquid behavior in the normal states. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal the unchanged monoclinic (S.G: $P2_1/c$) symmetry but an unusual crossover of the lattice parameters $b$ and $c$. Theoretical calculations based on the electron-phonon coupling picture reveal a very low $T_\text{c}$ (less than 1 K), manifesting an exotic pairing mechanism beyond the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Our findings show a promising way to explore high $T_\text{c}$ superconductivity by combining the 3d-transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.</description>

      <title>Real Space Imaging of Field-Driven Decision-Making in Nanomagnetic Galton Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible spintronic route to hardware implementation for decision making involves injecting a domain wall into a bifurcated magnetic nanostrip resembling a Y-shaped junction. A decision is made when the domain wall chooses a particular path through the bifurcation. Recently, it was shown that a structure like a nanomagnetic Galton Board, which is essentially an array of interconnected Y-shaped junctions, produces outcomes that are stochastic and therefore relevant to artificial neural networks. However, the exact mechanism leading to the robust nature of randomness is unknown. Here, we directly image the decision-making process in nanomagnetic Galton Boards using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. We identify that the stochasticity in nanomagnetic Galton Boards arises as a culmination of: (1) topology of the injected domain wall, (2) local disorder, and (3) strength of the applied field. Our results pave the way to a detailed understanding of stochasticity in nanomagnetic networks.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in powder production-an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to downselect from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, we compared the microstructural features between the laser-scanned sample and the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) one. Our results showed that the microstructure morphology is the same for both samples. SEM (&lt; x12000 magnification) shows differences in Zr and Er distribution justified by the repeated reheating for additional layers in the 3D-printed sample. Nonetheless, phase distribution was nearly the same at a high magnification scale under STEM (&gt; x80000). Phase sizes were also compared -- the laser-scanned sample resembles 3D-printed with an average size difference of 15% in Al grain, 14% in Al-Ni-Er ternary precipitates, and 4% in L12 nanoprecipitates. Cooling rates for the two samples were estimated by Rosenthal equation. The higher rate of the 3D-printed sample compared with that of the laser-scanned sample explains its slightly finer phases. The mechanical properties of the two samples were evaluated by microhardness tests. The hardness of the laser-scanned sample was found to be 21% less than that of the 3D-printed sample. The potential reasons were discussed. The study also showed that a similar difference in hardness was observed when the experiments were repeated on a printable benchmark Al alloy showcasing only 1% absolute error. Thus, laser-scanned samples can serve as a predictor of the hardness of LPBF samples, and their highly similar microstructure at high magnification allows their applications in rapid screening tests.</description>

      <title>Construction of Multi-Dimensional Functions for Optimization of Additive-Manufacturing Process Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The authors present a generic framework for the parameter optimization of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, one tailored to a high-throughput experimental methodology (HTEM). Given the large number of parameters, which impact the quality of AM-metallic components, the authors advocate for partitioning the AM parameter set into stages (tiers), based on their relative importance, modeling one tier at a time until successful, and then systematically expanding the framework. The authors demonstrate how the construction of multi-dimensional functions, based on neural networks (NN), can be applied to successfully model relative densities and Rockwell hardness obtained from HTEM testing of the Inconel 718 superalloy fabricated, using a powder-bed approach. The authors analyze the input data set, assess its suitability for predictions, and show how to optimize the framework for the multi-dimensional functional construction, such as to obtain the highest degree of fit with the input data set. The authors also compare and contrast the NN-based multi-dimensional functional construction to multi-variate linear regression, to polynomial regression, and to Gaussian process regression (GPR), highlight similarity between the NN-based multi-dimensional functional construction and the GPR, and offer insights into the suitability of each of these methods for the data set and the application at hand. In terms of the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, a relatively simple, single-layer NN with 5 or 10 nodes outperforms multi-variate linear regression, 2nd-order polynomial regression, and GPR for the primary Inconel 718 HTEM data set studied. The novelty of the research work entails the versatile and scalable NN framework presented, suitable for use in conjunction with HTEM, for the AM parameter optimization of superalloys, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Toward the theoretically observable limit of electron density distribution by single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction: The case of orbitally ordered Ti-3d^1 in YTiO_3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretically observable limit of electron density distribution by single-crystal X-ray diffraction is discussed. When F_{orb} and {\delta}F are defined as, respectively, the partial structure factor for an orbital and the deviation of the observed F from the true F, the accuracy of electron density attributable to F_{orb} is chiefly determined by the number of reflections satisfying the condition F_{orb}/F &gt; {\delta}F/F. Since F_{orb}/F, which is generally small for crystals with large F(0,0,0), is constant under a given set of experimental conditions, {\delta}F/F must be reduced to increase the number of reflections satisfying F_{orb}/F &gt; {\delta}F/F. The present paper demonstrates how to reduce {\delta}F mathematically and experimentally, and the following topics are covered: the Poisson statistics, accumulation of errors in the data collection and reduction procedure, multiple diffraction, conversion error from F^2 to F in refinement programs, which is unavoidable when the input quantities have different dimension from F, weighting of reflections, and tips. For demonstration, observation of the electron density of the Ti-3d^1 orbital in YTiO_3 by synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction is presented.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of van der Waals layered single crystals DyOBr and SmOCl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals single crystals DyOBr and SmOCl have been grown by flux method and their anisotropic magnetic properties are reported. DyOBr orders antiferromagnetically at T$_{N}$=9.5 K with magnetic moments lying along $a$-axis, similar as DyOCl. Its magnetic susceptibility shows an anomaly at T$^{*}$=30 K possibly due to the crystal field effect. Furthermore a 1/3 magnetization plateau is clearly observed under H$\parallel$a and H$\parallel$[110], which might be a field-induced spin-flop phase or some exotic quantum magnetic state. On the other hand, isostructural SmOCl undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{N}$=7.1 K and exhibits a contrasting Ising-like perpendicular $c$-axis magnetic anisotropy, which could be well explained by our crystal field calculations. Both DyOBr and SmOCl are insulators with band gap of $\sim$5 eV, our results suggest they are promising in building van der Waals heterostructures and applications in multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Transport Characteristics of Triply Periodic Bicontinuous Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D bicontinuous two-phase materials are increasingly gaining interest because of their unique multifunctional characteristics and advancements in techniques to fabricate them. Due to their complex topological and structural properties, it still has been nontrivial to develop explicit microstructure-dependent formulas to predict accurately their physical properties. A primary goal of the present paper is to ascertain various microstructural and transport characteristics of five different models of triply periodic bicontinuous porous materials at a porosity $\phi_1=1/2$: those in which the two-phase interfaces are the Schwarz P, Schwarz D and Schoen G minimal surfaces as well as two different pore-channel structures. We ascertain their spectral densities, pore-size distribution functions, local volume-fraction variances, and hyperuniformity order metrics and then use this information to estimate certain effective transport properties via closed-form microstructure-property formulas. Specifically, we estimate the recently introduced time-dependent diffusion spreadability exactly from the spectral density. Moreover, we accurately estimate the fluid permeability of such porous materials from the second moment of the pore-size function and the formation factor, a measure of the tortuosity of the pore space. We also rigorously bound the permeability from above using the spectral density. For the five models with identical cubic unit cells, we find that the permeability, inverse of the specific surface, hyperuniformity order metric, pore-size second moment and long-time spreadability behavior are all positively correlated and rank order the structures in exactly the same way. We also conjecture what structures maximize the fluid permeability for arbitrary porosities and show that this conjecture must be true in the extreme porosity limits by identifying the corresponding optimal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary restrictions on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) vdW heterostructures (vdWHs) are size limitation and alloying. Recently, a two-step vapor deposition method was reported to grow wafer-scale TMD vdWHs with little contamination [Nature 621, 499 (2023)]. In this letter, we developed a machine learning potential (MLP) which can accurately simulate the growth processes of bilayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ vdWHs under various conditions. Importantly, a SMMS (where M is Mo or W) structure is revealed as a highly stable intermediate easily introduces metal atom exchange and alloying. Eliminating the alloying contamination in TMD vdWHs is avoiding SMMS structure by preventing the landing of bare metal atoms. However, SMMS is revealed as an ideal electrode for MoS$_2$ FETs with low Schottky barrier.</description>

      <title>Analytical exciton energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for $s$-state exciton energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs): $E_{\text{ns}}=-{\text{Ry}}^*\times P_n/{(n-1/2+0.479\, r^*_0/\kappa)^2}$, $n=1,2,...$, where $r^*_0$ and $\kappa$ are the dimensionless screening length and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium; $\text{Ry}^*$ is an effective Rydberg energy scaled by the dielectric constant and exciton reduced mass; $P_n(r^*_0/\kappa)$ is a function of variables $n$ and $r^*_0/\kappa$. Its values are around 1.0 so we consider it a term that corrects the Rydberg energy. Despite the simple form, the suggested formula gives exciton energies with high precision compared to the exact numerical solutions that accurately describe recent experimental data for a large class of TMDC materials, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and MoTe$_2$. To achieve these results, we have developed a so-called regulated perturbation theory by combining the conventional perturbation method with several elements of the Feranchuk-Komarov operator method, including the Levi-Civita transformation, the algebraic calculation technique via the annihilation and creation operators, and the introduction of a free parameter to optimize the convergence rate of the perturbation series. This universal form of exciton energies could be helpful in various physical analyses, including retrieval of the material parameters such as reduced exciton mass and screening length from the available measured exciton energies.</description>

      <title>Designing Superionic Conductors Using Tetrahedrally Packed Structures</title>

Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced energy storage solutions, the crystal structure of ionic conductors plays a pivotal role in facilitating ion transport. The conventional structural design principle that compounds with the body-centered cubic (BCC) anionic frameworks have high ionic conductivity is well known. We have extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the anionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally packed (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP framework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic conductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our design principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including Li$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal structures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that new ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered. This work paves the way for the discovery and development of next-generation energy storage materials with enhanced performance.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals exhibit universal linear-in-temperature resistivity described by a Planckian scattering rate, the origin of which remains elusive. By employing a novel approach inspired by quantum optics, we arrive at the coherent state representation of lattice vibrations: quantum acoustics. Utilizing this nonperturbative framework, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations could serve as active drivers in the Planckian resistivity phenomenon, challenging prevailing theories. By treating charge carriers as quantum wave packets negotiating the dynamic acoustic field, we find that a competition ensues between localization and delocalization giving rise to the previously conjectured universal quantum bound of diffusion, $\hbar/m^{*}$, independent of temperature or any other material parameters. This leads to the enigmatic $T$-linear resistivity over hundreds of degrees, except at very low temperatures. Quantum diffusion also explains why strange metals have much higher electrical resistivity than typical metals. Our work elucidates the critical role of phonons in Planckian resistivity from a new perspective and reconsiders their significance in the transport properties of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Self-doped flat band and spin-triplet superconductivity in monolayer 1T-TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12493</link>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have become an established platform to engineer flat bands which can lead to strongly-correlated emergent phenomena. In particular, the family of Ta dichalcogenides in the 1\textit{T} phase presents a star-of-David charge density wave that creates a flat band at the Fermi level. For TaS$_2$ and TaSe$_2$ this flat band is at half filling leading to a magnetic insulating phase. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that ligand substitution in the TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ system produces a transition from the magnetic insulator to a non-magnetic metal in which the flat band gets doped away from half-filling. For $x\in[{0.846},{1.231}]$ the spin-polarized flat band is self-doped and the system becomes a magnetic metal. In this regime, we show that attractive interactions promote three different spin-triplet superconducting phases as a function of $x$, corresponding to a nodal f-wave and two topologically-different chiral p-wave superconducting phases. Our results establish monolayer TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$ as a promising platform for correlated flat band physics leading to unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Convexity of Nonlinear Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A technique for developing convex dual variational principles for the governing PDE of nonlinear elastostatics and elastodynamics is presented. This allows the definition of notions of a variational dual solution and a dual solution corresponding to the PDEs of nonlinear elasticity, even when the latter arise as formal Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to non-quasiconvex elastic energy functionals whose energy minimizers do not exist. This is demonstrated rigorously in the case of elastostatics for the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff material (in all dimensions), where the existence of variational dual solutions is also proven. The existence of a variational dual solution for the incompressible neo-Hookean material in 2-d is also shown. Stressed and unstressed elastostatic and elastodynamic solutions in 1 space dimension corresponding to a non-convex, double-well energy are computed using the dual methodology. In particular, we show the stability of a dual elastodynamic equilibrium solution for which there are regions of non-vanishing length with negative elastic stiffness, i.e.~non-hyperbolic regions, for which the corresponding primal problem is ill-posed and demonstrates an explosive `Hadamard instability;' this appears to have implications for the modeling of physically observed softening behavior in macroscopic mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Pseudospins revealed through the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect in massless Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, indicative of the transient light-matter interaction regime between quantum and classical realms, is widely recognized as an essential signature in wide bandgap condensed matter systems such as dielectrics. In this study, we applied the time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast optical responses in graphene, a zero-bandgap system. We observed in the gate-tuned graphene that the massless Dirac materials notably enhance intraband light-driven transitions, significantly leading to the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect compared to the massive Dirac materials, a wide bandgap system. In addition, employing the angle-resolved spectroscopy, it is found that the unique polarimetry orientation, i.e., perpendicular polarizations for the pump and the probe, further pronounces the optical spectra to exhibit the complete fishbone structure, reflecting the quantum pseudospin nature of Dirac cones. Our findings expand the establishment of emergent transient spectroscopy frameworks into not only zero-bandgap systems but also pseudospin-mediated quantum phenomena, moving beyond dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous phonon Gr\"uneisen parameters in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain tuning is a powerful experimental method in probing correlated electron systems. Here we study the strain response of the lattice dynamics and electronic structure in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. We observe an increase of the size of the direct semiconducting band gap. Although the majority of the optical phonons show only marginal dependence to applied strain, the frequency of the two B$_{2g}$ phonon modes, which have quadrupolar symmetry and already anomalously soften on cooling under zero strain, increases significantly with tensile strain along the $a$ axis. The corresponding Gr\"uneisen parameters are unusually large in magnitude and negative in sign. These effects are well captured by first-principles density functional theory calculations and indicate close proximity of Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ to a structural instability, similar to that encountered in excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method: extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method is based on generating a transform between the pseudo wavefunction and all electron wavefunction. For the accuracy of the method, it is important that the local part of the transform (in each atomic sphere $\mathbf{R}$) be over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work without modifying the transformation in any way by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more wavefunctions and having them transform via the identity.</description>
