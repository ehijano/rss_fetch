      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>The HST Legacy Archival Uniform Reduction of Local Group Imaging (LAURELIN). I. Photometry and Star Formation Histories for 36 Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present uniformly measured resolved stellar photometry and star formation histories (SFHs) for 36 nearby ($\lesssim$ 400 kpc) ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs; $-7.1 \le M_V \le +0.0$) from new and archival HST imaging. We measure homogeneous distances to all systems via isochrone fitting and find good agreement ($\le$ 2%) for the 18 UFDs that have literature RR Lyrae distances. From the ensemble of SFHs, we find: (i) an average quenching time (here defined as the lookback time by which 80% of the stellar mass formed, $\tau_{80}$) of 12.48 $\pm$ 0.18 Gyr ago ($z = 4.6_{-0.5}^{+0.6}$), which is compatible with reionization-based quenching scenarios; and (ii) modest evidence of a delay ($\lesssim$ 800 Myr) in quenching times of UFDs thought to be satellites of the LMC or on their first infall, relative to long-term Galactic satellites, which is consistent with previous findings. We show that robust SFH measurement via the ancient main sequence turnoff (MSTO) requires a minimum effective luminosity (i.e., luminosity within the observed field of view) of $M_V \leq -2.5$, which corresponds to $\sim$100 stars around the MSTO. We also find that increasing the S/N above $\sim$100 at the MSTO does not improve SFH precision, which remains dominated by stochastic effects associated with the number of available stars. A main challenge driving the precision of UFD SFHs is limitations in the accuracy of foreground dust maps. We make all photometry catalogs public as the first data release of a larger HST archival program targeting all dwarf galaxies within $\sim$1.3 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Merger Fractions in a Reionization-Era Protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers play a critical role in galaxy evolution, but their relationship to their surrounding environments is unexplored at high redshift. We investigate the galaxy merger rate among 124 [OIII] emitters at $5.3&lt;z&lt;6.9$ as a function of local galaxy density. Identified in the ASPIRE JWST/NIRCam grism survey, we investigate three density regimes: a $z=6.6$ quasar-centered protocluster, two overdensities at $z=5.4$ and $z=6.2$, and field galaxies. We evaluate merger candidates through close pair and morphological criteria in NIRCam imaging, finding that the $z=6.6$ protocluster contains the highest fraction of galaxies meeting either criterion. We observe a $&gt;3\sigma$ enhancement of the merger fraction amongst all three overdense structures compared to the field. Eleven galaxies are classified as ``active mergers" satisfying both merger criteria, all of which occur within the overdensity samples. We conclude that environment affects the merger rates of galaxies at $z&gt;6$, leading to increased specific star formation at the 4$\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Galaxies OBserved as Low-luminosity Identified Nebulae (GOBLIN): a catalog of 43,000 high-probability dwarf galaxy candidates in the UNIONS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of low surface brightness galaxies beyond the Local Group poses significant observational challenges, yet these faint systems are fundamental to our understanding of dark matter, hierarchical galaxy formation, and cosmic structure. Their abundance and distribution provide crucial tests for cosmological models, particularly regarding the small-scale predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. We present a systematic detection framework for dwarf galaxy candidates in Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) data covering 4,861 deg$^{2}$. Our pipeline preprocesses UNIONS gri-band data through binning, artifact removal, and stellar masking, then employs MTObjects (MTO) for low surface brightness detection. After parameter cuts and cross-matching, we obtain $\sim$360 candidates per deg$^{2}$, totaling $\sim$1.5 million candidates forming our GOBLIN (Galaxies OBserved as Low-luminosity Identified Nebulae) catalog. We fine-tuned the deep learning model Zoobot, pre-trained on Galaxy Zoo labels, for classification. Training data came from visual inspection of literature candidates with probability labels from expert assessments, capturing consensus and uncertainty. Applied to all MTO objects, our method identifies 42,965 dwarf candidates with probability $&gt;$ 0.8, including 23,072 with probability $&gt;$ 0.9. High-probability candidates correlate spatially with massive galaxies (log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \geq$ 10) within 120 Mpc. While some of these objects may have been previously identified in other surveys, we present this extensive catalog of candidates, including their positions, structural parameter estimates, and classification probabilities, as a resource for the community to enable studies of galaxy formation, evolution, and the distribution of dwarf galaxies in different environments.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: a new Galactic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Old open clusters can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they suffer from low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old ($\geq$ 500 Myr) clusters from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest open clusters as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old open clusters with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease of metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is well explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different Galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>

      <title>An upper limit of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ in dust from ALMA observations in 60 Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By virtue of their red color, the dust in little red dots (LRDs) has been thought to be of appreciable influence, whether that dust is distributed in a torus around a compact active galactic nucleus (AGN) or diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nascent galaxies. In Casey et al. (2024) we predicted that, based on the compact sizes of LRDs (unresolved in JWST NIRCam imaging), detection of an appreciable dust mass would be unlikely. Here we present follow-up ALMA 1.3mm continuum observations of a sample of 60 LRDs drawn from Akins et al. (2024). None of the 60 LRDs are detected in imaging that reaches an average depth of $\sigma_{rms}=22\,\mu Jy$. A stack of the 60 LRDs also results in a non-detection, with an inverse-variance weighted flux density measurement of $S_{1.3mm}=2.1\pm2.9\,\mu Jy$. This observed limit translates to a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ in LRDs' dust mass, and $\lesssim10^{11}$ L$_\odot$ in total dust luminosity; both are a factor of 10$\times$ deeper than previous submm stack limits for LRDs. These results are consistent with either the interpretation that LRDs are reddened due to compact but modest dust reservoirs (with $A_{V}\sim2-4$) or, alternatively, that instead of being reddened by dust, they have extreme Balmer breaks generated by dense gas ($&gt;10^{9}\,cm^{-3}$) enshrouding a central black hole.</description>

      <title>Formation of Supersonic Turbulence in the Primordial Star-forming Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.</description>

      <title>100 Proof: HI Observations of 100 Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the results of observations with the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in the HI line of 105 nearby dwarf galaxies, 60 of which were discovered recently in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Of 105 objects observed, we detected 77 galaxies with the following median parameters: an HI-flux of 0.69 Jy km/s, a heliocentric velocity of 732 km/s, and a $W_{50}$ line width of 32 km/s. 70 are isolated late-type objects and 35 are new probable satellites of nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 2787, NGC 3556, NGC 4490, NGC 4594 and NGC 5055). The detected galaxies are predominantly gas-rich systems with a median gas-to-stellar-mass ratio of 1.87. In general, they follow the classic Tully-Fisher relation obtained for large disk-dominated spiral galaxies if their $M_{21}$ magnitudes are used instead of B-magnitudes.</description>

      <title>RGC-Bent: A Novel Dataset for Bent Radio Galaxy Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT (Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of supermassive stars in the first stellar clusters: Dependence on the gas temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes is an open question that has been explored considering gas- and collision-based formation channels to explain the high number of quasars observed in the early Universe. According to numerical simulations, supermassive stars can be formed in atomic cooling halos when protostars reach accretion rates greater than $\sim 10^{-2}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ and fragmentation is inhibited on parsec scales. It remains uncertain, however, whether fragmentation on smaller scales leads to the formation of a star cluster instead of a supermassive star in the presence of possible cooling mechanisms. We explored the formation of a central massive object through collisions and the accretion of Population III stars in a primordial gas cloud in a gravitationally unstable system by varying the gas temperature and the degree of gravitational instability. We performed multiphysics simulations in the AMUSE framework with a hydrodynamical gas treatment through Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body dynamics for the protostars represented through sink particles. Our results show that central massive objects with masses $\sim 10^4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed by accretion and collisions at different temperatures and that the most massive object can reach efficiencies of $\sim 0.61$ for atomic cooling conditions and $\sim 0.95$ for more unstable conditions. We observe a quasi-disk formation for warmer temperatures and a higher contribution through collisions to the mass of a central massive object. Our results show that the embedded cluster is in a supercompetitive accretion regime in which it obtains mass by accretion that is regulated by self-gravity. Our results suggest that in more unstable conditions with lower gas temperatures, a more massive supermassive black hole seed can form.</description>

      <title>Identifying lopsidedness in spiral galaxies using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 30\% of disk galaxies show lopsidedness in their stellar disk. Although such a large-scale asymmetry in the disk can be primarily looked upon as a long-lived mode ($m=1$), the physical origin of the lopsidedness in the disk continues to be a puzzle. In this work, we develop an automated approach to identify lopsided galaxies from the SDSS DR18 using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based on the publicly available AlexNet architecture. We select nearly face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with the Petrosian 90\% light radius (\textit{petroR90\_i}) greater than $20^{''}$. Based on the visual inspection, we choose 106 lopsided spiral galaxies and 105 symmetric spiral galaxies, as our training set. Our trained model achieves a testing accuracy of 92.8\% at the end of 150 epochs. We then employ the trained model on a set of 813 face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with $17^{''} \le petroR90\_i \le 20^{''} $ and identify 452 new lopsided spiral galaxies. We next investigate the cosmic web environments in which the galaxies are located, using the Hessian matrix of the density field. We find that 39\% of the lopsided galaxies are located in sparser environments such as sheets and voids. This may provide interesting clues towards understanding the origin of lopsidedness in isolated galaxies, where distortion due to the tidal interactions is less frequent.</description>

      <title>Reconciling extragalactic star formation efficiencies with theory: insights from PHANGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New extragalactic measurements of the cloud population-averaged star formation (SF) efficiency per freefall time $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS show little sign of theoretically predicted dependencies on cloud-scale virial level or velocity dispersion. We explore ways to bring theory into consistency with observations, highlighting systematic variations in internal density structure that must happen together with an increase in virial level typical towards galaxy centers. To introduce these variations into conventional turbulence-regulated SF models we adopt three adjustments motivated by the host galaxy's influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and a gas density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we let the internal gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the gas density distribution is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a freefall time. The combined result is a strong reduction to $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ predicted in multi-freefall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal probability density functions and variations that are tied to the PL slope $\alpha$. The $\alpha$ needed to match PHANGS $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$'s vary systematically with environment in the sense that gas sitting furthest from virial balance contains more gas at high density. With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our `self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similar to the original, roughly `virialized cloud' single-freefall models. However, outside disks with their characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the massive star-forming region NGC 6334 and their relationship with the properties of dust filaments probed by [CII] and PAH emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19844</link>

Abstract: We carried out the near-infrared ($JHK_{\rm s}$) imaging polarimetric observation with the polarimeter SIRPOL on the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4 m telescope and [CII] line mapping observation with a Fabry-P\'{e}rot spectrometer on board a 100-cm TIFR balloon-borne far-infrared telescope toward NGC 6334, and revealed the relationship between the plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic fields and [CII] emission lines to investigate the star formation in the molecular cloud. The polarization vector map shows that the POS magnetic fields are approximately perpendicular to the main filament elongation of NGC 6334. On the other hand, the POS magnetic fields tend to be parallel or random for the other filaments in NGC 6334. The [CII] emission shows a distribution well aligned with the main filament. Strong [CII] emission is also seen in the hub-filament system. Since the main filament is sandwiched between two HII regions, it is most likely that gas is efficiently accreting from the shells of the HII regions along the magnetic field resulting in active star formation. This is consistent with the NGC 6334 being bright in [CII] emission.</description>

      <title>Impact of &lt;3D&gt; NLTE on GCE of oxygen with the RAdial Velocity Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar abundances, coupled with kinematics are a unique way to understand the chemo-dynamical processes that occurred to build the Milky Way and its local volume as we observe today. However, measuring abundances is challenging as one needs to properly address the effect of departure from the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as well as the commonly used 1-dimensional model atmosphere. In this work, we constrain the chemical evolution of [O/Fe] in FG stars of the RAVE survey with [O/Fe] abundances derived in non-LTE (NLTE) and with horizontally-temporally-averaged 3D (&lt;3D&gt;) model atmospheres. Using standard spectral fitting method, we determine for the first time LTE and NLTE [O/Fe] ratios from the O triplet at 8446A in turn-off and dwarf stars thanks to intermediate-resolution RAVE spectra, assuming both 1D and &lt;3D&gt; model atmosphere. NLTE effects play a significant role when determining oxygen even at a resolution of R= 7500. Typical NLTE-LTE corrections of the order of -0.12 dex are measured in dwarfs and turn-off stars using 1D MARCS models. In contrast to applying &lt;3D&gt; NLTE abundance corrections or the classical 1D LTE, the full &lt;3D&gt; NLTE spectral fitting yields improving the precision of abundances by nearly 10%. We show that the decrease of [O/Fe] in the super-solar [Fe/H] regime is rather characterised by a flat trend when [O/Fe] is computed in &lt;3D&gt; NLTE from full spectral fitting. We attribute this flattening at super-solar [Fe/H] to the interplay between locally born stars with negative [O/Fe] and stars migrated from the inner MW regions with super-solar [O/Fe], supporting the complex chemo-dynamical history of the Solar neighbourhood. Our results are key for understanding the effects of &lt;3D&gt; and NLTE when measuring [O/Fe]. This work is a test bed for the analysis of 4MOST low-resolution spectra that will share similar properties as RAVE in the red wavelength domain.</description>

      <title>Toward Unraveling Cyanopolyyne Surface Chemistry: A Preview on Isolated Systems From HC_{3}N to Ethyl Cyanide and Propylamine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanopolyynes, a family of nitrogen containing carbon chains, are common in the interstellar medium and possibly form the backbone of species relevant to prebiotic chemistry. Following their gas phase formation, they are expected to freeze out on ice grains in cold interstellar regions. In this work we present the hydrogenation reaction network of isolated HC_{3}N, the smallest cyanopolyyne, that consists over-a-barrier radical-neutral reactions and barrierless radical-radical reactions. We employ density functional theory, coupled cluster and multiconfigurational methods to obtain activation and reaction energies for the hydrogenation network of HC_{3}N. This work explores the reaction network of the isolated molecule and constitutes a preview on the reactions occurring on the ice grain surface. We find that the reactions where the hydrogen atom adds to the carbon chain at carbon atom opposite of the cyano-group give the lowest and most narrow barriers. Subsequent hydrogenation leads to the astrochemically relevant vinyl cyanide and ethyl cyanide. Alternatively, the cyano-group can hydrogenate via radical-radical reactions, leading to the fully saturated propylamine. These results can be extrapolated to give insight into the general reactivity of carbon chains on interstellar ices.</description>

      <title>Realistic Multi-temperature Dust: How Well Can We Constrain the Dust Properties of High-redshift Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the dust properties of high-redshift galaxies from their far-infrared continuum emission is challenging due to limited multi-frequency data. As a result, the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) is often modeled as a single-temperature modified blackbody. We assess the accuracy of the single-temperature approximation by constructing realistic dust SEDs using a physically motivated prescription where the dust temperature probability distribution function (PDF) is described by a skewed normal distribution. This approach captures the complexity of the mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted temperature PDFs of simulated galaxies and quasars, and yields far-infrared SEDs that match high-redshift observations. We explore how varying the mean temperature ($\bar{T}_d$), width, and skewness of the temperature PDF affects the recovery of the dust mass, IR luminosity, and dust emissivity index $\beta_d$ at z=7. Fitting the dust SEDs with a single-temperature approximation, we find that dust masses are generally well-recovered, although they may be underestimated by up to 0.6 dex for broad temperature distributions with a low $\bar{T}_d &lt;$ 40 K, as seen in some high-redshift quasars and/or evolved galaxies. IR luminosities are generally recovered within the $1\sigma$ uncertainty (&lt; 0.3 dex), except at $\bar{T}_d &gt;$ 80 K, where the peak shifts well beyond ALMA's wavelength coverage. The inferred dust emissivity index is consistently shallower than the input one ($\beta_d$=2) due to the effect of multi-temperature dust, suggesting that a steep $\beta_d$ may probe dust composition and grain size variations. With larger galaxy samples and well-sampled dust SEDs, systematic errors from multi-temperature dust may dominate over fitting uncertainties and should thus be considered.</description>

      <title>On the chaos induced by the Galactic bar on the orbits of nearby halo stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the Milky Way's accreted substructures have been discovered and studied in the space of energy $E$, and angular momentum components $L_z$ and $L_{\bot}$. In a static axisymmetric system, these quantities are (reasonable approximations of) the integrals of motion of an orbit. However, in a galaxy like the Milky Way with a triaxial, rotating bar, none of these quantities are conserved, and the only known integral is the Jacobi energy $E_J$. This may result in chaotic orbits, especially for inner halo stars. Here, we investigate the bar's effect on the dynamics of nearby halo stars, and more specifically its impact on their distribution in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space. To this end, we have integrated and characterised the orbits of halo stars located within 1 kpc from the Sun. We computed their orbital frequencies and quantified the degree of chaoticity and associated timescales, using the Lyapunov exponent and the frequency diffusion rate. We find that the bar introduces a large degree of chaoticity on the stars in our sample: more than half are found to be on chaotic orbits, and this fraction is highest for stars on very bound and/or radial orbits. Such stars wander in $(E, L_z, L_{\bot})$ space on timescales shorter than a Hubble time. This introduces some overlap and hence contamination amongst previously identified accreted substructures with these orbital characteristics, although our assessment is that this is relatively limited. The bar also induces a number of resonances in the stellar halo, which are of larger importance for lower inclination, prograde orbits. Because the effect of the Galactic bar on the local halo is important for stars on very bound and/or radial orbits, clustering analyses in these regions should be conducted with care. Replacing the energy by $E_J$ in such analyses could be an improvement.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sagittarius stream with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy is one of the most prominent satellites of the Milky Way (MW). It is currently undergoing tidal disruption, forming an extensive stellar stream that provides key insights into the assembly history of the MW halo. In this study we analyzed RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in the Sgr stream provided in Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), for which new estimates of photometric metallicities are available in the literature, and accurate distances were calculated using the reddening-free period-Wesenheit-metallicity ($PWZ$) relation. We determine the mean metallicity of RRLs in the Sgr stream to be ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.62 \pm 0.01$ dex. We measure a metallicity gradient as a function of stripping time from the Sgr progenitor of $0.05 \pm 0.02$ dex/Gyr, indicating that the metal-poor RRLs were stripped earlier during the accretion process. The far arm is found to be the most metal-poor structure of the Sgr stream, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.98 \pm 0.37$ dex, significantly lower than that of the leading ($-1.69\pm0.31$ dex) and trailing ($-1.64 \pm 0.28$ dex) arms. Our findings show that the RRLs in the far arm of the Sgr stream exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]=$-2.4$ dex and $-1.7$ dex. The main body of the stream is the most metal-rich structure, with a mean metallicity of ${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.58 \pm 0.31$ dex and a radial gradient of $-0.008 \pm 0.005$ dex/kpc. We find almost negligible metallicity gradients of $(-0.2 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the trailing arm and $(-1.0 \pm 0.5)\times 10^{-3}$ dex/deg in the leading arm, in agreement with previous studies. Finally, we investigate the bifurcation of the Sgr stream and conclude that the metallicity difference between the faint and bright branches is not confirmed based on the RRLs in our sample.</description>

      <title>Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \sim 6.5$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M_\mathrm{up}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\sigma_\mathrm{UV}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological feedback from a halo assembly perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of feedback from galaxy formation on cosmological probes is typically quantified in terms of the suppression of the matter power spectrum in hydrodynamical compared to gravity-only simulations. In this paper, we instead study how baryonic feedback impacts halo assembly histories and thereby imprints on cosmological observables. We investigate the sensitivity of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) power spectrum, X-ray number counts, weak lensing and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) stacked profiles to halo populations as a function of mass and redshift. We then study the imprint of different feedback implementations in the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological simulations on the assembly histories of these halo populations, as a function of radial scale. We find that kSZ profiles target lower-mass halos ($M_{\rm 200m}\sim 10^{13.1}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) compared to all other probes considered ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$). Feedback is inefficient in high-mass clusters with $\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, but was more efficient at earlier times in the same population, with a $\sim 5$-$10\%$ effect on mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ (depending on radial scale). Conversely, for lower-mass halos with $\sim10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, feedback exhibits a $\sim5$-$20\%$ effect on mass at $z=0$ but had little impact at earlier times ($z&gt;2$). These findings are tied together by noting that, regardless of redshift, feedback most efficiently redistributes baryons when halos reach a mass of $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{12.8}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and ceases to have any significant effect by the time $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{15}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We put forward strategies for minimizing sensitivity of lensing analyses to baryonic feedback, and for exploring baryonic resolutions to the unexpectedly low tSZ power in cosmic microwave background observations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling compact planetary nebulae: Broad-band survey analysis and LAMOST confirmation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) are pivotal for advancing our knowledge of stellar evolution and galactic chemical enrichment. Recent progress in surveys and data analysis has revolutionized PN research, leading to the discovery of new objects and deeper insights into their properties. We have devised a novel photometric selection method, integrating GAIA and Pan-STARRS photometry, to identify compact PN candidates. This approach utilizes color-color diagrams, specifically (G-g) versus (GBP-GRP) and (G-r) versus (GBP-GRP), as primary criteria for candidate selection. The subsequent verification step involves confirming these candidates through LAMOST spectroscopic data. By cross-referencing a comprehensive dataset of PNe, GAIA, Pan-STARRS, and LAMOST DR7 spectra, we explore the potential of our approach and the crucial role played by these surveys in PN research. The LAMOST spectra provide compelling evidence supporting our selection criteria, especially for compact PNe characterized by strong emission lines and low continuum. Applying these criteria to a catalog of emission line objects, we have selected a PN candidate. Detailed analysis of its LAMOST spectrum unveiled classical Balmer emission lines and high-ionization lines (He II, [Ar V], [Ar III], [Ne III]), characteristic of high-ionization PNe, without low-excitation lines. Using the photoionization code Cloudy, our modeling revealed parameters including an ionizing source temperature of 180x10^3 K, luminosity around 3400 Lsun, and gas abundances encompassing various elements. Comparing the PNe evolution track, the progenitor star was estimated to have a mass of 2 Msun. Our findings show strong promise for separating compact PNe from other objects and provide a robust framework for further exploration of these surveys in the context of planetary nebulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Universe's magnetogenesis can be investigated with radio observations of cosmic filaments, where the information on the initial magnetic field seeds is expected to be preserved in time. In this work, we update the comparison between recent observational results in filaments with the predictions from recent cosmological simulations to check whether one of them is favoured. The radio probes we use are the rotation measure (RM) of filaments as a function of the redshift ($z$), stacking of synchrotron emission from filaments, and the RM radial profile away from galaxy groups. The first two probes favour the presence of a dominant primordial magnetic field component and disfavour a sole astrophysical scenario, the third probe does not yet give an unambiguous outcome. We also estimate the average field strength in filaments. Independently of the scenario and the shape of the astrophysical component RM, it is in the range 10--60 nG at $z=0$, while, when restricted to the model that gives the best match to the simulations, it gives $43\pm 7$ nG, with an astrophysical component RM rapidly decreasing with the redshift.</description>

      <title>The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS): The UV Photometric Catalog and Stripped Star Candidate Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most massive stars will interact with a binary companion during their lifetimes. These interactions can remove the hydrogen-rich envelope, producing intermediate-mass ($\sim$2-8 M$_\odot$) and helium-rich stars. These "stripped stars" are predicted to emit predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and can therefore be identified via a UV excess provided they are not outshone by their companion. However, despite their importance to binary evolution, supernovae, and ionizing feedback, few stripped stars have been confirmed. This is likely due to the scarcity of wide-field, high angular resolution, UV surveys of stellar populations with reliable distances and extinction estimates. To address this, we present the Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Clouds Survey (SUMS) catalog. We use the Tractor forward modeling software to perform PSF photometry on 2,420 Swift-UVOT images of the LMC and SMC. The resulting public catalog contains 734,869 sources in three UV filters to a depth of $\sim$20 Vega mag. We perform validation tests on the photometry pipeline and highlight the catalog's broad applicability. We then identify sources with excess UV light compared to main-sequence stars and apply a series of quality cuts. From this, we identify 522 candidate stripped stars in the LMC and 298 in the SMC. We assess the potential contamination from other UV excess systems and argue the dominant uncertainty to be dust: early main-sequence stars can mimic the colors of stripped star binaries when extinction is overcorrected. This survey lays the groundwork for the first systematic census of stripped stars and opens new windows into binary evolution and massive star populations.</description>

Abstract: In October 2024, the object BL Lacertae experienced the brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historically bright $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$2.59 $\times 10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ with a detection of a 175.7 GeV photon with Fermi-LAT. This event was also followed by very high-energy $\gamma$-ray detection with LHAASO, VERITAS, and MAGIC. Soon after, Swift-XRT and Swift-UVOT follow-up confirmed the concurrent flare in X-ray, UV, and optical bands. A minimum flux doubling/halving time of 1.06 $\pm$ 0.26 hour with 4$\sigma$ significance has been observed with the Fermi-LAT orbit binned light curve. No compelling correlation has been found between $\gamma$-ray spectral indices and fluxes. The log-normal $\gamma$-ray flux distribution during the flare confirms the multiplicative nature of the non-linear perturbation causing the flare. We applied a one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the broadband SED during the flaring period. The broadband SED modeling reveals that the sudden enhancement of the magnetic field and bulk factor might promote the flare. The SED modeling also suggested a more compact emission region, which may be described by a shorter variability time than the observed one. The hadronic part best fitted the high energy part of the spectrum, suggesting the jets of BL Lac could provide a promising environment to accelerate the cosmic ray particles, such as protons. The jets of BL Lacertae could also be the possible source of astrophysical neutrinos, as an upper limit on neutrinos has already been reported from IceCube.</description>

      <title>Resistive Collapse of 2D Non-rotating Magnetized Isothermal Toroids: Formation of Pseudodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of singular magnetized toroids (Li &amp; Shu 1996) is a natural representation of an early phase in star formation, bridging the prestellar and protostellar phases of the collapse of molecular cloud cores. We revisit the collapse study of Allen et al. (2003b), now with explicit nonideal MHD (Ohmic diffusivity $\eta$) and higher resolution using a code able to cover a broader range of the magnetization parameter $H_0$. Galli-Shu equatorial pseudodisks form for all values of $H_0$ and $\eta$, and the asymptotic central mass growth rate is in the scale $\dot{M}_*\sim(a^3/G)(1+H_0)$, where $a$ is the isothermal sound speed, consistent with previous results and predictions. The explicit Ohmic diffusivity makes the field line structure less radial than in previous work, connecting the pseudodisk more effectively to its surroundings. Matter can fall efficiently onto the pseudodisk surfaces, forming oblique shocks, where shock heating and large density gradients raise the possibility of rich astrochemistry. Pseudodisk size and structure are influenced by magnetic diffusivity. Force and velocity ratios were computed to explore the magnetic support within the pseudodisk and its induced slowdown in infall velocity. Magnetic diffusivity was measured to control the strength of these effects and their location within the pseudodisk. The dependence of the field line configurations, pseudodisk structure, and velocity ratios on magnetic diffusivity has observable consequences for collapsing envelopes.</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of BOSS-CMASS galaxies with semi-analytical model for galaxy formation and halo occupation distribution</title>

Abstract: The spatial distribution and clustering property of massive and luminous galaxies have provided important constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters and physical processes governing galaxy formation. In this work, we construct and compare independent galaxy-halo connection models in the application of clustering measurement at non-linear scales of BOSS-CMASS galaxies. In particular, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model with 11 parameters and a semi-analytical model (SAM) with 16 parameters to describe the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole. We focus on the redshift space distortion effect caused by the galaxy peculiar velocity. With a empirical model for the velocity field and the emulator technique, we can explore the parameter space of both models. We find that the HOD model is able to recover the underlying velocity field of SAM with an accuracy of 3\%, and can be improved to 1\% when the analysis is restricted to scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc. The comparison is based on multiple samplings in the parameter space which can verify the convergence of the empirical and physical model for galaxy formation. Then we perform constraints on the model parameters using clustering measurement of CMASS galaxies. Although limited by the emulator accuracy and the flexibility of the model, we find that the clustering measurement is capable of constraining a subset of the SAM parameters, especially for components sensitive to the star formation rate. This result leads us to anticipate that a joint analysis of both clustering and abundance measurements can significantly constrain the parameters of galaxy formation physics, which requires further investigation from both theoretical and observational aspects.</description>

      <title>Clustering and physical properties of AGN and Star-Forming Galaxies at fixed stellar mass: does assembly bias have a role in AGN activity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a volume-limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to compare the spatial clustering and physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG) at fixed stellar mass. We find no statistically significant difference in clustering strength or local density between AGN and SFG. However, after matching their stellar mass distributions, we detect statistically significant differences (at a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$) in colour, star formation rate (SFR), $4000\r{A}$ break measurements (D$4000$), and morphology. These differences persist across both low- and high-density environments, suggesting that AGN are not driven by environmental factors. The development of favourable conditions for AGN activity within a galaxy may depend on the diverse evolutionary histories of galaxies. Our results imply that AGN activity may arise stochastically, modulated by the complex assembly history of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Kinematics of Post-starburst Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies can reach quiescence via rapid transition through merger-triggered starbursts that consequently affect both their kinematics and star formation rates. In this work, we analyze the spatially resolved kinematics of 89 post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) with data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and place them in context with star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs) to study the impact of merger history on galaxy kinematics. We measure the specific angular momentum to characterize them as slow or fast rotators. We find that the MaNGA PSB sample has $\sim 6\%$ slow rotators, which is less than the $\sim 14\%$ slow rotators in the ATLAS$^{3D}$ ETG sample and $\sim 20\%$ slow rotators in the MaNGA ETGs, and more than the $\sim 3.5\%$ slow rotators in the MaNGA SFGs. This implies that for PSBs to evolve into ETGs, they must still lose some angular momentum. While ETGs with higher stellar mass tend to be slow rotators, PSBs do not follow this trend. We find significant correlations between specific angular momentum and mass-weighted age for the SFG and ETG samples, but do not see any significant trends within the short PSB phase. These results indicate that significant evolution in angular momentum must continue to take place as the galaxy ages after the PSB phase. For PSBs to evolve directly into ETGs, they must undergo dry mergers to shed excess angular momentum without causing further epochs of star formation.</description>

      <title>Relatively young thick disks in star-forming late-type galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We trace the evolution of eight edge-on star-forming disk galaxies by analyzing stellar population properties of their thin and thick disks. These galaxies have relatively low stellar masses (4~$\times$~10$^9$ to 6~$\times$~10$^{10}$~$M_{\odot}$). We used Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations and a full-spectrum fitting to produce spatially resolved maps of the ages, metallicities, and [Mg/Fe] abundances, and we extracted the star formation histories of the stellar disks. Our maps show thick disks that are older, more metal-poor, and more [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than thin disks on average. The age differences between thin and thick disks are small (about 2~Gyr), however, and the thick disks are younger than previously observed in more massive and more quiescent galaxies. The thin and thick disks both show mostly sub-solar metallicities, and the vertical metallicity gradient is milder than previously observed in similar studies. The [Mg/Fe] differences between thick and thin disks are not sharp. The star formation histories of thick disks extend to recent times, although most of the mass in young stars was formed in thin disks. Our findings show thick disks that are different from the old quiescent thick disks that were previously observed in galaxies with different morphologies and/or masses. We propose that the thick disks in these galaxies did not form quickly at high redshift, but formed slowly over an extended time. The thin disks also formed slowly, but a larger mass fraction was created at very recent times.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ IV: Distinguishing Near vs. Far Distances in the Galactic Center Using Spitzer and Herschel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is of fundamental importance in understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, since the 3-D structure influences the location and intensity of star formation, feedback, and black hole accretion. Current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish between existing 3-D models. Dust extinction is one diagnostic tool that can help determine the location of dark molecular clouds relative to the bright Galactic Center emission. By combining Herschel and Spitzer observations, we developed three new dust extinction techniques to estimate the likely near/far locations for each cloud in the CMZ. We compare our results to four geometric CMZ orbital models. Our extinction methods show good agreement with each other, and with results from spectral line absorption analysis from Walker et al. (submitted). Our near/far results for CMZ clouds are inconsistent with a projected version of the Sofue (1995) two spiral arms model, and show disagreement in position-velocity space with the Molinari et al. (2011) closed elliptical orbit. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the Kruijssen et al. (2015) open streams. We find that a simplified toy-model elliptical orbit which conserves angular momentum shows promising fits in both position-position and position-velocity space. We conclude that all current CMZ orbital models lack the complexity needed to describe the motion of gas in the CMZ, and further work is needed to construct a complex orbital model to accurately describe gas flows in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>MOCCA: Effects of pristine gas accretion and cluster migration on globular cluster evolution, global parameters, and multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the MOCCA code, we study the evolution of globular clusters (GCs) with multiple stellar populations. For this purpose, the MOCCA code has been significantly extended to take into account the formation of an enriched population of stars from re-accreted gas with a time delay after the formation of the pristine population of stars. The possibility of cluster migration in the host galaxy and the fact that the pristine population can be described by a model not in virial equilibrium are also taken into account. Gas re-accretion and cluster migration have a decisive impact on the observational parameters of clusters and the ratio of the number of objects between the pristine and enriched populations. The obtained results, together with observational data, suggest a speculative refinement of the AGB scenario that makes it possible to explain some observational data, such as the ratio of the pristine to the enriched populations, the observational fact that for some GCs the pristine population is more concentrated than the enriched one, and possibly a correlation between the ratio of the number of enriched stars to the total number of stars and the mass of the cluster. In this scenario, it is important to take into account the environment in which the cluster lives, the conditions in the galaxy when it formed, and the fact that a significant part of the GCs associated with the Galaxy come from dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. The initial conditions of GCs in our simulations differ from the widely used typical models, as they require GCs to fill the Roche lobe rather than being highly concentrated within it, imposing strong constraints on their formation locations within the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations in MOCCA globular cluster models: Transient spatial over-concentration of pristine red giant stars driven by strong dynamical encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent findings show that, in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars are more centrally concentrated than enriched RGB stars. This contradicts most multiple-population formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be more concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model that exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars at 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution scenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our results indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple populations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by dynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB progenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration of 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs with present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 - 20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young due to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone significant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively small number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the spatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to biased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent over-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect driven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical encounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB scenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as NGC 3201 and NGC 6101.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of the GD-1 star stream velocity distribution within $\pm$3 degrees of the centerline find a total line of sight velocity spread of 5-6 km/s in the well measured $\phi_1=$ [-30, 0] region (Valluri25). The velocity spread is far above the $\sim$2-3 km/s of a dissolved globular cluster in a smooth galactic potential. The dynamical heating of the GD-1 star stream is simulated in an evolving model Milky Way potential which includes the subhalos extracted from cosmological CDM and WDM Milky Way-like halos. The model bridges fully cosmological Milky Way-like halos and late time static Milky Way potentials allowing individual streams to be accurately integrated. An evolving CDM subhalo population acting for $\sim$11 Gyr heats GD-1 to 6.2 km/s. The WDM (7 keV and lighter) models develop a velocity dispersion of 3.9 km/s, only slightly greater than the 3.5 km/s in an evolving smooth halo without subhalos for 11 Gyr. The dynamical age of the best model stream is close to the isochrone age of the stars in the stream. Subhalos with masses in the decade around $10^{7.5} M_\odot$, below the mass range of dwarf galaxies, dominate the dynamical stream heating.</description>

      <title>How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.</description>

      <title>Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; $\sim0.1$ dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems ($\sim0.15$ dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise ($\rm20~pixel^{-1}$) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame $0.12-1.06~\mu$m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to $\sim 0.04$ dex and $\sim 0.05$ dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H$\alpha$/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.</description>

Abstract: The LMC's stellar bar is offset from the outer disk center, tilted from the disk plane, and does not drive gas inflows. These properties are atypical of bars in gas-rich galaxies, yet the LMC bar's strength and radius are similar to typical barred galaxies. Using N-body hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the LMC's unusual bar is explainable if there was a recent collision (impact parameter $\approx$2 kpc) between the LMC and SMC. Pre-collision, the simulated bar is centered and co-planar. Post-collision, the simulated bar is offset ($\approx$1.5 kpc) and tilted ($\approx8.6^\circ$). The simulated bar offset reduces with time, and comparing with the observed offset ($\approx0.8$ kpc) suggests the timing of the true collision to be 150-200 Myr ago. 150 Myr post-collision, the LMC's bar is centered with its dark matter halo, whereas the outer disk center is separated from the dark matter center by $\approx1$ kpc. The SMC collision produces a tilted-ring structure for the simulated LMC, consistent with observations. Post-collision, the simulated LMC bar's pattern speed decreases by a factor of two. We also provide a generalizable framework to quantitatively compare the LMC's central gas distribution in different LMC-SMC interaction scenarios. We demonstrate that the SMC's torques on the LMC's bar during the collision are sufficient to explain the observed bar tilt, provided the SMC's total mass within 2 kpc was $(0.8-2.4) \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. Therefore, the LMC bar's tilt constrains the SMC's pre-collision dark matter profile, and requires the SMC to be a dark matter-dominated galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Context. There is a contradiction between the characteristic spacings in observed regular chains of star-forming regions in the spiral arms of galaxies, ~500 pc, and the estimates of the wavelength of gravitational instability in them, &gt;1 kpc. Aims. Calculating the scales of regularity in the grand-design galaxy NGC 628 in terms of gravitational instability, using modern high-quality observational data and comparison of them with scales of spatial regularity of the star-forming regions and molecular clouds in the spiral arms of the galaxy. Methods. We investigate two mechanisms of gravitational instability against radial and azimuthal perturbations in a multi-component disk with a finite thickness. We obtain a map of the instability wavelength distribution and compare its median value with the typical scale of observed regularity. Results. The maps of instability parameters Q and S, which are related to radial and azimuthal perturbations respectively, show a good alignment between gravitationally unstable regions and areas of recent star formation. By analyzing the distribution of giant molecular clouds along the spiral arms of NGC 628, we found a similar regularity of about 500-600 pc that was previously observed for starforming regions. Additionally, the distribution of the wavelength most unstable to azimuthal perturbations yielded a median value of about 700 pc, which is close to the observed scale regularity. This last finding resolved the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observed scales of star-forming regions' regularity.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Shell Structure in the Primary Outflow from IRAS 15398-3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications. A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow. When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.</description>

      <title>Ages and metallicities of quiescent galaxies: confronting broadband ($UVJ$) colours with stellar absorption lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, studying quiescent galaxies beyond $z\sim1$ has been challenging due to the reliance on photometric spectral energy distributions, which are highly susceptible to degeneracies between age, metallicity, dust, and star-formation history. Only recently has deep, rest-frame, optical spectroscopy made robust metallicity and age measurements possible, allowing us to empirically assess their effects on continuum shapes. To this end, we measure ages and metallicities of $\sim700$ massive ($10.2\lesssim\log(M_*/M_\odot)\lesssim11.8$), quiescent galaxies at $0.6\lesssim z\lesssim1.0$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) via continuum-normalized, absorption-line spectra, and compare with independent rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colours. Age increases along the quiescent sequence as both colours redden, consistent with stellar population synthesis (SPS) model predictions. Metallicity increases perpendicularly to the age trend, with higher metallicities at redder $U-V$ and bluer $V-J$ colours. Thus, age and metallicity behave differently in the $UVJ$ diagram. Moreover, this trend conflicts with SPS model expectations of increasing metallicity approximately along the quiescent sequence. Independent dynamical mass-to-light ratio trends also differ dramatically from SPS model predictions. These results demonstrate that relying on model fits to continuum shapes alone may lead to systematic biases in ages, metallicities, and stellar masses. The cause of these data-model disparities may stem from non-solar abundance patterns in quiescent galaxies or the treatment of evolved stellar phases in the models. Resolving these discrepancies is crucial, as photometric data remain central even with JWST.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.</description>

      <title>The Peekaboo galaxy: new SALT spectroscopy and implications of archive HST data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dwarf galaxy Peekaboo was recently identified as a Local Volume (LV) gas-rich and 'eXtremely Metal-Poor' (XMP) dIrr. Its gas metallicity is Z~Zsun/50, with +/-1$\sigma$ uncertainty range of [Zsun/72-Zsun/35]). Its the "Tip of Red Giant Stars" (TRGB)-based distance is of 6.8$\pm$0.7 Mpc. HST data for its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller part, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few Gyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf. As such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties of both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised gas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te) method for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected, to estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line [OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical "strong-line" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the east HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve substantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of 12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E region consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The fainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown from a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour $V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are likely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions. With the new optical spectra, the Peekaboo galaxy is confirmed as the lowest-metallicity dwarf in the Local Volume and the valuable object for indeep multi-method studies.</description>

      <title>Improving Galaxy Cluster Selection with the Outskirt Stellar Mass of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, $M_{\textrm{out}}$, defined as the total stellar mass within a $[50,100]$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, $\lambda$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of $M_{\textrm{out}}$ and $\lambda$ with halo mass. Our results show $M_{\textrm{out}}$ has a scatter consistent with $\lambda$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find $\lambda$-selected samples introduce features into the measured $\Delta \Sigma$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that $M_{\textrm{out}}$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the $\lambda-M_{\textrm{out}}$ scaling relation to be $0.49 \pm 0.02$ and $0.38 \pm 0.09$.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. We speculate that the statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>HDO ice detected toward an isolated low-mass protostar with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward a low-mass protostar, L1527 IRS, which may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>
